Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,The park is small  but nice. Its about 1/4 mile south of Summerlin Parkway and the CAT bus depot. There are a lot of benches  trees for shade  a playground  and a splash pad- although the splash pad is concrete. If they had made the pad with the rubber material this would be a 5Star Park. Parking is on the little side street  no parking lot that I could see.   This park could easily be confused with the small park north of the CAT bus depot. While both parks are nice  the Northern Park does not have a splash pad.
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,This park is always such a nice place to come to! Always clean and the grass is always nicely cut. Very family friendly for the kids with the play area and the bbq areas for the adults. There's also a walk path  it's nicely kept and its a very nice walk along side the golf course. Pet friendly too as well
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,This park is a nice park with a lot of grassy area and connected to some nice trails. It is your average barely maintained City of Las Vegas park.
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,I love love love this park but have had issues at night lately with people in bushes and on the slides in the dark alone....which is super creepy when you don't see them...We take our dogs here to chase rabbits late night (they don't hurt them just chase them for fun) and coyotes have been coming down from the mountains to feed on the rabbits so please be careful with your dogs!!! They hang out in on the hill and gutter between the park and golf coarse...Im sure they come into the park with the hill running alongside it... I just never saw them inside the park myself only on the hill....I really wish I could go back but with the creepers and coyotes I'd have to leave my kids and dogs at home....which kind of defeats my purpose =(
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,THE SOUTHEAST GATEWAY PARK TO ANGEL PARK TRAIL    Angel Park  located at the southwest corner of Durango Drive at Venetian Strada is the Gateway to Angel Park Trail. At 6 acres  Angel Park provides tennis courts  a playground   open grassy spaces  picnic tables  and a scenic view of the distant mountains towering over the adjacent Angel Park Golf Course.    Angel Park is a nice place for families and laid back people. There is a well-kept playground adjacent to picnic tables. When people swing on the two swings  they take in the photo spot of the distant mountains towering over the close-up Angel Park Golf Course. When people step off the swings  there are a couple of turtle statues nearby  if I am not mistaken work as a splash pad. When people walk further back they will reach the dead-end of the tennis courts. Minus graffiti   offensive words are nonexistent on park equipment. This adds to the family-friendly environment.     Pink pathways (to my eyes) and green grass are the attractive color patterns of Angel Park. The pink different the Angel Park walking path from the Angel Park Trail that feeds into it and runs parallel along the north border overlooking Angel Park Golf Course. The majority of the 6 acres is a carpet of deep green grass sparsely blanketed by a canopy of trees.   Angel Park is where people step off Angel Park Trail to shape-up at fitness equiptment. Happiness is health. And Angel Park is an attractive spot to get happy.    The major flaw of Angel Park is that it needs a parking lot. The only place to park is on Venetian Stranda. On my visit  I parked a relatively short distance north of Angel Park in the R.T.C. Park & Ride at Durango and Westcliff. It only took a few minutes for me to reach Angel Park by ways of Angel Park Trail.    Angel Park is a nice Gateway to Angel Park Trail. The City of Las Vegas is doing a nice job maintaining it  controlling graffiti and vandalism  and keeping it clean. This is the type of environment that I enjoyed spending some time in when I stepped off the Angel Park Trail.
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,This is an awesome park! Great walking trails  very nice location with mountain views and easily accessible from anywhere in LV! (It's located next to the LV transit system)   This place is great for family's and pets!   Enjoy...
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,Angel Park playground and fenced water feature. Near two tennis courts  a trail that leads to Angel Park Golf Course  a walking/jogging track  picnic areas and public restrooms.
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,"Best ""little"" park in vegas. My family and I frequent this park often. Small enough to see through whole park with a nice walking/bike  trail. Often times you will see wild bunnies running across the grass.Great park to fly a kite and just enjoy some green grass with plenty of shade.There is a playground as well and tennis courts ajacent to the bathrooms."
Active Life;Tennis;Parks;Playgrounds,Nice playground.  No splash pad.  Has two play structures one for little kids and one for bigger kids.  Has a nice spurs by ground instead of sand or cement.  Decent shade cover.  Only stayed at the playground but I don't see any restrooms here.  Water fountains looks like one on the ground for animals.  Table and benches as we'll no grills.
Print Media;Mass Media,I went here to get my Las Vegas Advisor (LVA) Pocketbook of Value (POV). It includes 132 (this year) coupons and offers for places in and around Vegas. I stop in here 2 or 3 times a year for other various gaming books that are value priced from time to time. The selection of books and their price tag varies throughout the year. I snagged a great poker book for a few bucks on clearance that normally retails for around $25.  In my experience  the staff is always friendly and helpful. There is never a wait and they get you in and out quickly.
Print Media;Mass Media,im definitely a fan  its a coupon book for 30 bucks last a ful year there are always high end buffets for half price so you easily make your money back on the buffet alone  there are some deals on hotels as well  have used it all over the city. if you are a vegas local i would say check it out
Print Media;Mass Media,Was a member since day 1  subscriber for years. Wrote a letter asking how they chose their question of the day because they keep posting they need new questions and the ones they post are not interesting to the majority of people. After months  received a snotty  unprofessional response from Jessica Roe who has such thin skin she took my question as a personal insult to her. If the shoe fits...........some people will never  ever get what Customer Service means and she is at the top of the list. Will now unsubscribe.
Print Media;Mass Media,This is my third year purchasing Las Vegas Advisor coupon books  and I can't say enough nice things about them. We save so much money every year  and they get us to try new places that we haven't been to before. A friend of mine who comes to town several times a year has gotten hooked on them too. They pay for themselves in just a few uses (buffets at Mirage and Planet Hollywood and they're already paid for!)  and don't have all the stipulations that casinos love to include (earning points before use  etc.). I really enjoy the online newsletter too. I just think this is the best buy in Las Vegas!
Print Media;Mass Media,The Advisor is a great news...letter that comes out every month. To cut to the chase  they also are online: http://www.lasvegasadvisor.com/  The newsletter itself is very small for what you pay for it. But it's very dense with information. Anthony Curtis is the resident gambling genius! For over a decade! Once he drew attention to a small bar because they set their payoffs 1-2% lower than all the others in the valley. Anthony was the only person to go nuts over this as the masses of people he... advised didn't seem to pay attention at this incredible incident.   It's known for posting a now world famous list of 5 og the biggest bargains in town every week. It's listed the 99-cent cocktail  $3.00 steak and eggs and other graveyard specials. It's been the forefront of hotels this year that have had dirt cheap room rates around or under $20/ NIGHT. In JULY  traditionally the busiest month of the year  along with August.  There is one other newsletter like this that I can't seem to find on yelp. It doesn't even have a blank listing  so I may start it when I find enough business information.  Las Vegas Advisor is definitely one of the jewels of Vegas.
Print Media;Mass Media,Insider's guide to Las Vegas  baby. & Amazing coupon offers. No brainer here.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I didn't have any beauty treatment here.  I went there for wellness care and I had 4 appointments with the chiropractor there  who does a wellness program that includes evaluation and supplements.   I liked him right away  I think he knows his stuff too.  I was initially excited to work with him on my various issues.  I was discouraged to talk about costs but at the end of my 3 day evaluation I was hit with a $6 000 fee to start treatment.  This is the second time this has happened to me from a chiropractor that offers wellness programs.  The first one wanted $9 000. At least with this one  I walked away with some good advice and knowledge about my body.  But I must admit I felt setup because he knew from the beginning what the cost would be.  So if you can afford it I say go for it.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,Lynette is by far the best technician.  Not only have my blemishes and issues disappear way before those of others....I consider Lynette a wonderful human being. I seriously trust this woman with my skin and my life. She's a true angel.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I had a worthwhile therapeutic massage from Kat.  Kat found knots in muscles everywhere! She worked them out semi-painfully  but I knew it was worth a moment of pain to get true muscle relief.   I found this place through Groupon  and I will definitely be going again.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,"Let me begin with the positive. My therapist and massage was first rate and I am happy I bought the groupon discount.  On the negative side  Valhalla Med Spa felt sterile  like a doctor's office. There was absolutely no ambiance whatsoever. I booked an aromatherapy massage and that was a joke. I was shown a selection of essential oils and asked to choose a bottle. If any were burned  placed  etc.  I never smelled a thing (and I have a sensitive nose). There were no warm towels  cushy robes  candles  nice smells  or adequate music. The music  in fact  was a tinny Josh Grobon CD and sounded like it came from a $20 cd player without real speakers. If Valhalla wants ratings as a ""spa""  it needs to step up the ambiance.  Finally  if I had paid full price I would have been sorely disappointed  regardless of the actual massage. I expected the whole massage experience  not just the rub. For the discounted massage rate of $50  it was worth it and I would and did book again. Full price--nope.  PS The staff was professional (again  like a doctor's office)  but I did not get the tour or explanations Leslie R received."
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I got a groupon for this place. I checked it out and the facial I would give an OK  Mary  was very nice and professional however I wish I would have known that the facial only last 35 minutes and the room was right by the front desk so we were both listening to their conversation and laughs. Not relaxing at all. Oh well. On my way out I was told that I am getting a second service too I wish they would have told me when I made my reservation. The Medspa is kinda old school needs a face lift we are in 2014 but clean :) Check out my pics!
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I've been going to the med spa for almost 3 years. They've done wonders with my skin.; I've done skin tightening  photofacials  peels and oxygen facials. They are all so soothing-with the added benefits of glowing skin and taking years away.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,Great professional service  great doctor who cares about his patients.  Close by in shopping center  large area for parking.  Quick in and out service.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,Expert care and incredible people skills best describe Lynette the best esthetician on the planet! Your face is in great hands with Lynette! Cutting edge treatments for your entire body.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,Lynette  hands down the best. She really knows how to work miracles. Her skin just proves that she knows the secrets & what she's talking about. The staff of ladies are all so sweet and helpful. I love this place!! Thank you Lynette  your amazing!!
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,"Unprofessional & rude.  Be careful if you go for wellness/weight loss the lady is not a Physician  PA or NP. I asked Dr. Weingrow what her clinical title was and he just said ""my assistant"" she ""prescribed"" me with diet pills and a thyroid pill without even checking or being aware of my medical history. I called my primary physician  and he immediately asked me not to take the pills.  They also offer services outside of the clinic for a discounted price."
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I actually found this place from a Groupon. I am so glad I bought it  the staff was professional and courteous. Their office was welcoming  warm and had a very relaxing atmosphere. The lady who took care of me was fantastic in every way. She gave me a tour of their building and explained the different types of products and procedures that they offered at the spa and adjoining medical office/chiropractic center. I was very impressed. I will be going back  and I definitely recommend this place to everyone.
Health & Medical;Hair Removal;Medical Spas;Beauty & Spas;Laser Hair Removal;Weight Loss Centers,I had a group-on for Zerona treatment  was a rip off...I didn't feel anything nor did the girl explain anything to me. I looked up the reviews on this machine and its a scam. The lady did not answer one question for me. My timer went off and 10 minutes later she came in and told me to flip.The office manager wouldn't refund my money. Once you question them they are very unprofessional and do not care about customer service esp the little red head girl they have working in the front If I was you and you want a nice and pleasant visit go to another spa.
Contractors;Office Cleaning;Professional Services;Home Services;Home Cleaning,This company takes really good care of our office. They come once a week and it is completely spotless every time. We have been using them for about 2 years and we haven't had any incidents whatsoever. Great company and great prices!!!
Contractors;Office Cleaning;Professional Services;Home Services;Home Cleaning,2 Good was recommended to me by a friend who uses them  They arrived at my home at the promised time  were very cordial and did a very good job at a fair price. what more could one ask! Thank you Robert and Judith !
Contractors;Office Cleaning;Professional Services;Home Services;Home Cleaning,Incredible job cost me $200 the home was absolutely disgusting and this cleaning service made it like brand new see pics.    Will always use these guys
Contractors;Office Cleaning;Professional Services;Home Services;Home Cleaning,This company was horrible to deal with  they were rude  late and then couldn't do the cleaning they advertised. Would never recommend them to anyone it would just be a huge waste of time. Scheduled for them to come out at 9am  they didn't arrive until 10:30 and then they couldn't do the work they told me over the phone they could do  when confronted about it  the owner was rude and swore at me over the phone. Do yourself a favor  avoid this place.  They have also taken down their thumbtack profile because of negative reviews.   This company cannot be trusted.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I don't even know where to start! If you're thinking about bringing your kids here....DON'T!! I have 2 young children (5 & 6)  we've been to this office a total of about 4 times. Yes the office is nice and clean with lots for the kids to do. Yes the front office staff is friendly. With that out of the way...they rip you off and don't even have a dental hygienist. A couple of months ago I realized the ""hygienist"" was only polishing my son's teeth and never took the scaler out to clean his teeth. When I asked her why  she said only the dentist can. I said but aren't you a dental hygienist? She told me she was. Later I find out from Dr Boi that he doesn't staff a hygienist because he likes to do the scaling himself. But he only scaled 2 teeth in the front. If you don't have a hygienist then why did your dental assistant tell me she was??  Most insurances don't cover nitrous oxide. Last year this office charged me $20 for nitrous...this year $111. My son had 2 appointments this month to get his cavities filled. one today and one 2 weeks from now. So now i'm paying $222 just for nitrous. I call them today to tell them I will pay the $111 for my visit today but if they wants to keep my children as patients they will have to charge me less on my next visit. The answer to that was not only NO but do not bring your child to your appt today because Dr Boi ""doesn't feel comfortable working on your child"".  REALLY DR BOI!!  That is so unprofessional. That action doesn't show any concern for my child's dental health.  I was willing to pay the full amount today and just find another dentist next year to fill the rest for his cavities. I guess this makes you feel like you won  you broke up with us before we could break up with you. Sounds like High School stuff"
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,My son has been with Cavity Busters for over a year now. The office is pleasantly decorated in favor of their tiny patients.  Its not cold and overwhelming like typical offices. On my son's last x-ray  Dr. Bui informed me of an adult tooth that was coming in quickly and suggested that the baby tooth be extracted. My husband and I were nervous about the extraction and wanted to put off the appointment for later on. The adult tooth as predicted by the Dr. came in and we had no choice but to extract. We got an appointment same day and everything went smoothly.  It took approximately 15 minutes and Dr. Bui joked with my son the entire time.  I couldn't have asked for a better experience.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,My two kids' first dentist. Dr. Bui is the best. He is compassionate and sweet. Their office is nice and clean. Too bad we changed insurance plans. I would definitely recommend him!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I love this place!! They always treat my kids great. The staff and Dr. Bui is awesome.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We have always driven past this location numerous times and realized  our daughter needs her teeth cleaned. So we checked  they accept our insurance  and are fairly close to the house. Our first appointment  had to be rescheduled because of a miscommunication of the appointment time. They said 10 but we wrote down and have a card that says 10:30  so when we arrived we were told we were too late and needed to reschedule. Big bummer!  So we rescheduled  my husband took our daughter and she was so well behaved she earned a coin! My husband was so excited because he's Vietnamese and to his surprise the so is Dr. Bui! So they of course had some stuff to talk about.   What I'm impressed with is the staff does their best to keep the place clean  full of toys to ease the dentist worries  and a very kid-friendly environment. Our family has a bunch of kids and I plan of spreading the good word of this fabulous office!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I forgot how condescending Dr. Bui is until my 10 son's last visit. He had to have  teeth extracted cause his permanent teeth were coming in with no place to go. I had on our last visit  told his office I was concerned about them being able to get him numb enough because of my family history (my mother   sister  a niece  and myself ) have a extremely hard time getting numb from Lidocaine and Novocaine. I found out my son also suffers from this and could they please use Marcaine . They wait until we are in the office after waiting months for this appointment to tell me we don't use Marcaine and they could refer us to an oral surgeon. I say "" That since we are already here to do it and if he is in pain I will stop them.""                                           So he starts talking to my son like he is a 2 year old baby while they give him the laughing gas.They gave him shot after shot after shot.lost track of how many   he then tells my son that i tricked him that he can get him numb. Really?! My son started saying it hurts while he is twisting the tooth out. So guess what more shots for my son.When he is finished pulling his teeth he basically called me a liar in front of my son because he got him  numb eventually but not enough. My son told me after we got home that it hurt while he pulled them out but the nitrous oxide rendered him unable to verbalize fully. My insurance is not accepted everywhere so my options are severely limited so I am stuck . Don't let the fact that their waiting room has games and looks kid friendly.fool you. The fact is I have taken my kids there 3 times because I have no choice  but if you have good insurance and can go anywhere please don't go here.."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Complete rip off! They are beyond money hungry. They milk the insurance company  then come after your wallet! Be careful don't let the niceness and color office fool you  that's how they suck you in. Before agreeing to any surgeries for your child with this company get a second opinion!!! Not even worth the one star!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We have had a few experiences with this office. Everybody tends to be a little condescending with the exception of the front office staff. I usually leave this office feeling a bit uncomfortable. They have treated my oldest daughter with no problems  but like other posters mentioned  some of the comments they make are unnecessary. My youngest daughter was a little more hesitant at this office. This is when I noticed how they lack patience. They give up very easily and become frustrated when children do not cooperate immediately. I decided to take my daughter elsewhere and she had a great experience. She got all of her work done with no crying or squirming.  Overall  this office is ok for regular check ups  but not the best in town. If your children need work done  go elsewhere.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I am confident and comfortable bringing my 8 year old to see Dr. But he has all the things kids love in the waiting room. He used ""happy air"" and worked like a charm for my son when he needed fillings. The ladies are all friendly the wait is never too long. My appointment it always on time and Dr. But and his staff get the job done accordingly. My son doesn't do well with doctors he hates anyone poking around his mouth but he's completely okay when they do his cleaning! Shocking! I will be a regular patient and now I am introducing my 3 year old to him"
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Great experience... Laura was very helpful  answered all my questions. Definitely a kid friendly facility. My daughters weren't scared at all...
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,My 20 month old had his first dentist visit ever and as parents  we were happy over-all. They did not do anything invasive (no x-rays) or anything complicated which was good. Already booked for his next appointment in 6 months!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"This was my second visit & now I remember why I  didn't like this office. The front staff is wonderful  they fitted me in their schedule last minute & were so helpful  unfortunately I can't say the same about the back office assistants. Excuse my language but they ALL had Bitch-face! For a children's dentist these ladies are not a good fit. Maybe it was too early for them & they didn't get their morning cup of coffee  but working with children you can at least have a smile on your face. The pregnant one in specific  stated to the Dr. she was unable to get x-rays when no such thing came about. Waiting 30 mins to be seen  the dentist was just OK  explains things to you as if you are oblivious to what he's saying. Explaining over & over..saying  ""You need to understand..."" I definitely will not bring my son back to this office  just based off the staffs unfriendliness. Children are nervous enough already try putting a smile on your face & be approachable."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Best dentist and great staff. Dr. Bui knows how to make the kids comfortable and as a pediatric dentist you can tell that he loves working with kids and that he takes time to make his office really kid-friendly. They put effort into putting awesome decorations and amenities so the kids can enjoy their stay. I highly recommend this place!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,A visit to the dentist office isn't always the easiest trip for kids  mine included.  Dr. Bui and his hygenists are fantastic!  Super pleasant  patient and do everything they can to put your child at ease with all the instruments going in their mouth.  The experience starts at the front office with Natalie. She has all the answers you are seeking  and super friendly and welcoming!  It's awesome to walk in to a doctor's office and have someone greet you and not treat you as just another number.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,He's great! Makes all 3 of my kids feel comfortable happy and he makes it fun! Wall decor is great at distracting kids and making it fun! There reward idea with the machine tokens is awesome !
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I've been coming here for years  and Dr Bui & his staff are amazing. With 3 kids  we've had lots of cleanings  a couple emergency visits  and anything from fillings to a frenectomy. Dr Bui and his staff are great at keeping kids calm and comfortable while doing what they need to do. Appointments are quick  waiting time is minimal  and scheduling is a breeze. I don't often recommend places  but I'd recommend this pediatric dentist in a breeze.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr. Bui is great.  He explains things thoroughly and is very understanding if you have questions.   We had a lot of work done and it was less then half of what I have had to pay in the past.  Would recommend this office most definitely.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Vanessa  Danni  Michelle were very helpful. We have been seeing Dr Bui for 8 years. Best pedi-dentist in town. Well worth our 40 minute drive!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"This review is long over due. Dr Bui is the best pediatric  dentist my son had ever seen. Dr Bui has so much patience and knowledge.  My 5 year old son had an infection on his gum due to a bad tooth. Dr Bui patiently took out his tooth. Actually this could have been prevented if we had allowed my son to be put to sleep so all his teeth could be worked on. That whole idea scared me. However after the incident of the gum Dr Bui agreed to try working on my son's teeth without putting him to sleep. His worry was my son might not be still. The good news is my Dr Bui managed to politely get my son to stay still throughout the 3 consecutive visits. My son had a tooth pulled out  3 fillings and a baby crown. I can't be more grateful.  Dr Bui was so professional and caring.  My son kept saying  ""I really like the dentist"".  One thing I almost forgot  my family was moving to another state pretty soon  the staff managed to get early appointments for us for all the procedure."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We have been dealing with Dr Bui for a few years now and we are absolutely love him and his whole entire staff! They deal with children fabulously   they are so patient and kind and I just really love the dynamics and how they deal with their little patience which are our little angels and they treat them like they're their little angels. I highly recommend Dr Bowie and his staff to treat your children
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr.Bui is amazing and so is his friendly staff. My 4 year old just loves going to the dentist because of the staff and dr.bui being such a child friendly atmosphere. I definitely would recommend taking your child to this location.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"Not worth it. The hygienist helping Dr. Bui is as frustrated as he is. Any kid would fidget around after a 35 minute wait in the chair as Dr. Bui works on multiple kids at the same time  just coming in & out the room in the middle of the procedure! Also the whole  ""be good"" or you won't get any tokens for the prize machines is unnecessary. I can simply give my kid a quarter myself. No need for you to remind my nervous daughter to behave! I see others had the same problem here. I simply told them to stop talking about the tokens  who cares. He rather squeeze in as many patients as possible and is frustrated EASILY. Took my business elsewhere."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We switched to Cavity Busters upon a recommendation from a friend. My kids didn't have a good experience with the last dentist office and hated going to the dentist. Since switching  there has been no complaints. They love it!! Dr. Bui makes them feel so comfortable and he always cracking jokes. As a parent  it's nice to be greeted with a friendly smile and with courtesy. Natalie knows the meaning of customer service  which now a days is hard to find. Keep up the good work Cavity Busters!!!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"Dr. Bui   First and foremost  I would like to make it clear to you of the false statements written on my son's file regarding my alleged persistence in having his root canal done in the office. I may have insisted that they do the cleaning as well as take the proper X-rays needed to more accurately diagnose any issues he may have had  but to generalize and not be able to separate those details from the fact that I repeatedly told dr. Renalie that if she thought she would be able to successfully do the procedure there  that I was fine by it. I made it clear to her that since she was the professional  I would trust her judgement and support her decision to perform the root canal in the office. Nevertheless  if she truly felt that my son wasn't properly reacting to the nitrous oxide and saw the possible complications that may arise if she proceeded  I now truly question her ability to make the proper calls under the same circumstances. She still proceeded to have him wrapped even after seeing the extent of his resistance. And against my better judgement  I still trusted her decision to move forward. It is unbelievable that now and after all that was said and done  your office finds no remorse and is not willing to take even a part of the responsibility to what went wrong in my son's treatment. Anyone in their right mind would see that if your office strongly advised against it being done there  it wouldn't have been done  even if what they've noted in his file was true.  In hindsight  it was especially odd that your staff seemed to not be on the same page from the beginning of his treatment plan as on the day of his root canal  Dr. Renalie suggested targeting the side that needed the root canal but on the flip side  Gabby advised that they would be doing the fillings on the right side first since they were smaller. I am sure anyone would already see the inconsistency and red flags in that but again  against my better judgement  I chose to look past the ""minor"" miscommunication between your office personnel and continued to give your office the benefit of the doubt.  As far as suggesting that I seek a 2nd opinion  please be clear that I decided to seek the 2nd opinion on my own and after taking all of these facts in consideration. However  the notes inputted by Natalie falsely states that you and dr. Renalie recommended that I seek the 2nd opinion.  On a side note  I am not sure what your normal protocols are with regards to handwashing and changing gloves but I did  in my last two visits to your office including the day of my son's procedure  observe that your dental assistants still held and touched your X-ray equipment and such items like the X-ray protective gown after they've put on a clean pair of gloves and right before they had their hands in my son's mouth. I don't need to be an expert to see that that was unsettling for me to notice.  In conclusion  I am more disappointed in your staff's failure to take any type of responsibility  the manipulative tactic in using me as an escape goat in Dr. Renalie's error in decision making  but more so  entering false allegations in my son's file to protect your practice."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I took my 5 year old son in last month for his first dentist visit...I know  5 years is a long time to wait (epic Mom fail). Anyway  turned out he had 12 cavities!! Yikes! two of them were on his front teeth and Dr. Bui was concerned he might have to cap those instead of only filling them. Dr. Bui is super nice and great with kids  he talks to them like they are people...not patients. I schedule the ""surgery"" because they suggested my son have this work done under anesthesia so it could be done all at once and he wouldn't hate the dentist for repeated visits (which it would have taken many) to get all of the cavities filled. When my son was finished with surgery  Dr. Bui came out and told me he was able to save the two front teeth by filling them in and all of the cavities were filled with tooth-colored fillings. They did a flouride treatment and cleaned his teeth and now his whole mouth looks beautiful again!!   I was so happy with Dr. Bui and the staff at Sahara Surgery Center. Thanks to everyone!"
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr. Bui and his staff are amazing to both my kids and I. Service is fast and efficient. Although it is far from where I live it is worth the drive. My kids enjoy their play rooms but  of course what kid wouldn't love playing with iPads !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr.Bui is so great with my kids that they are always excited to go get their teeth clean! Great staff and always get us in on time! I would recommend this place for anyone who have kids!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I love this dentist office. My daughter has been going to doctors all her life and this is one of the many few that she likes going to. The staff is very friendly and great with kids. When she starts getting scared they do everything they can to help her feel comfortable and are patient to wait to continue until she calms down. I have recommend this office to several friends and family and they have also enjoyed comming.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,My wife and I brought our 20 month old twins in for their very first appointment.  Dr. Bui and his staff are fantastic.  They were very gentle with my kids and patient with my nervous wife.  I work in the medical field and know how hard it is to find the right doctor for your family.  Look no further  Dr. Bui at Cavitybusters is a guarantee win.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr. Bui and staff are awesome! Great customer service! most kids are scared of Dentists  but not mine! My kids look forward to coming here! I appreciate the friendly appointment reminders!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I'm not sure who had more fun here -- me or my kid. Who am I kidding... it was definitely me because I didn't have to get my teeth cleaned. This dentist office off of South Rainbow  across the street from the Arroyo shopping complex has a large lobby area with couches  a large TV  and a kid's play area with iPads loaded with plenty of  games.  The cleaning stations are located in one big room with no dividers with about four or five chairs  a couple TVs that were playing Ice Age and a cool super hero mural on the wall. That's plenty of stuff to distract some kids from getting their teeth cleaned  but not mine. My little guy was scared and didn't enjoy the experience. But  that's not a reflection on the staff. Dr. Bui  who is currently the only dentist working there  was fun  energetic  and patient. He did all he could to ease my son's fears and make it as pleasant as possible. With the amount of sweets my kid loves to shove in his face  I know we'll be back.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I love Dr. Bui and his staff. Everyone is great there! My kids love it here and they never had a bad experience. People are saying negative things  about this place  we've been coming here since my son was 3 and he's 8 now.  Dr Bui is very thorough with each exam  minimal wait time and the environment is very pleasant.  I'll be back every 6 months for my kids cleaning! Highly recommend this place!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,I'm amazed at how awesome the team at Cavitybusters is. Vanessa & Dani at the front desk were both courteous & sweet. Angie  the assistant was so patient & good with my 3yo. Dr. Bui is SO GOOD with kids  it's remarkable. I'm glad my friend referred me to this place. Definitely made this an enjoyable experience for my babe's first dentist appt.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Great service my daughter really enjoyed her visit to the dentist clean place and knowledgable and friendly staff! We just moved here to Vegas and I was in search of a dentist for my daughter I found this place on Yelp and was completely satisfied.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We walked in for our first appointment and the place was great for kids!  The waiting room was decorated in a way that was calming to the kids.  The staff from the front desk to Dr. Bui were very friendly  warm  and sympathetic to the needs of each child.  They even have fun sunglasses so the light isn't to bright for the kids...and they're super fun.  One of my girls had to get a tooth pulled and Dr. Bui was awesome.  He was so fun in his conversation with my daughter that she didn't even realize that he pulled the tooth out until after when he told her.  It's rare these days to see someone who is really good at what he does for work and enjoy it at the same time.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We have been going to Dr. Bui for 5 years. My boys always have a positive experience. Friendly  knowledgeable staff.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr. Bui is arrogant to say the least. You cant even ask him questions or he gets flustered. Children are like numbers. The staff made so many billing problems they had me doing there work for them! All this and my children didn't even have cavities. Don't bother the Dr he thinks he is special..............
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,The best children's dentist!! Highly energetic and very good with helping kids through procedures and keeping them comfortable.  Love the look and feel of the office and the whole staff is wonderful!
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"My sister who is currently a dentist in California referred Dr. Bui to us.  She went to dental school here in Las Vegas  and we told her to ask her colleagues who the best pediatric dentist here in town is and they all said  ""Dr. Bui!""  We have now been to Cavitybusters several times and each time he has not disappointed us.  He makes our son feel very comfortable and because of his positive experiences in the office  he is not afraid to go the dentist.  When we say he has a dentist appointment  he actually gets excited.   Our son now wants to be a dentist when he grows up!!!  When you visit Cavitybusters  you'll see that Dr. Bui has a passion for dentistry.  Through his jokes and distraction techniques  he makes sure kids feel comfortable while working on their teeth.  Thank you Dr. Bui and staff for everything that you do to ensure kids feel  at ease when going to the dentist."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Dr Bui is amazing.  My son is a major gagger.  He was so patient with him.  My son does not usually like going to the dentist but since he started going to Cavity Busters he is now excited to go.  The place is so kid friendly with all the stuff they have there.  and the staff are great and very accommodating.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I've always had doubts with this office supposedly a Pediatric Dental office  I'm done and will not go back. I don't know why we went back  maybe because they made periodic appts for check up n cleaning. It was my mistake as a mom.  First appt we had a problem with Tech B. She would repeatedly tell my nervous child things such as "" be a big girl and just get it over with  I can't clean your teeth if you don't listen! You are gonna get hurt if you move! "" and the list goes on. This happened while my daughter just lay there not moving or crying. She occasionally opened n closed her mouth because her mouth was too dry while cleaning.  We requested not to have her treat our kids.  And Dr Bui is another story. We are very disappointed and offended. Once again our child is acting like a normal child at the dentist. Very nervous. His "" why you are not helping ha? Omg you are not doing a good job today I can't do my job!"" was plain insulting and wrong as a dr who treats children. He's not shy to show his frustration and it is very selfish. He also asked me of I told our daughter she's going to the dentist. I said yes. And here it goes a big ""wwwwhy did you do that mom?????"" I always tell my kids where we are going. It should never be a surprise. We had the worst time with him.  We will not go back Nor recommend this office. We are done! The only person that's saving this office is Miss D at the front. She was very helpful and sweet."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,This was our first time going to Dr. Bui and the Cavity Busters team and I have to say it was one of the best child based service experiences I have ever had from start to finish. I took my 7 and 8 year old for a check up  cleaning and x-ray. The front desk was kind and helpful and the waiting room was clean and comfy even with the after school rush (I did not see ipads but my boys were fine watching Home on the bi screen). Though the practice was busy and there were many patients we were in very close to our appt. time and nothing was rushed once in the chairs. The hygienists performing the cleanings were super sweet and reassuring with the boys calling them sweetie and honey the whole time but in a very natural and motherly way. Dr. Bui is a knowledgeable and very kid friendly dentist. Though they were quick and efficient I in no way felt rushed or like we were on an assembly line. Everything was explained and all questions were answered in full and at a very attentive pace. He took time to show both boys where they were doing well and how to improve in a manner they understood. As we were checking out to pay my youngest even commented on how he loves it there and cannot wait to go back which I believe is rare to hear at any dental office (this was also prior to getting a toy from the token machine at the front). If you are a parent on the SW side of town looking for a great dental team do not hesitate to call this location (or if you are anywhere in the Vegas valley and willing to drive a bit for great pediatric service) . I believe it will set your child up for a positive outlook on going to the dentist which is almost as important as dental care itself.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Love the doctor and staff. The place makes a kid feel at home. The whole environment makes all fear of  going to the dentists go away. I highly recommend this doctor.
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,"I use to truly love this dentist.  Dr bui was great with my daughters extraction and he was good with my son's 1st silver cap. That all changed the other day when I went in for my son's 2nd silver cap. The nurse that was assisting dr bui was nasty. Early in the appointment I told her my son isn't in a good mood because we are moving and packing all the toys. Well during the appointment he started to cry ( expected during dental work) he sat as still as he could for a 5 year old. After the appointment they usually give tokens for the prizes in the front. The nurse told my son ""you weren't a good boy so now you don't have any toys at home and you won't get any here either maybe next time you'll be a good boy and maybe santa might come still"" all she kept saying was your not a good boy your not a good boy. It broke his heart. He's only 5. I will not be coming back here and I will be telling everyone I know about my experience here. He cried all the way home  not because of pain he was numb but because of what that woman said to him. He said ""momma am I a good boy? I didn't mean to cry""  Awful experience."
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,Great staff and very friendly. The waiting area had iPads  a playroom  a computer  and a TV to entertain the kids while waiting. The office is very kid friendly and has a super hero mural painted on the wall in the exam room. Dr Bui was amazing with my 4 year old's first visit!! He made my son feel very comfortable  sang songs to him  and even showed me and explained to me what to look for in his teeth and how to brush his teeth properly. He also explains me when his teeth should start falling out and went to expect down the road. I will definitely be going back. Get there 15 minutes early to fill out paperwork
Health & Medical;Pediatric Dentists;Dentists,We switched our two kids' dentist with a change of insurance. We were reluctant at first  but actually had a better experience here than with our regular doctor. The front office and dental assistants were so friendly with our kids and Dr. Bui made them feel very comfortable. Even getting x-rays taken was no problem! They did let us know beforehand that they would just try  but not be forceful if our two year old was not interested. They also give your kids a choice of a toy or tokens (to purchase toys in the front) at the end of the visit.   Dr. Bui gave clear instructions on problem areas without making us feel guilty for it. Even though the wait time is low  the waiting room has toys  TVs  and a bunch of iPads along the walls. The same goes for the patient rooms.
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,BEWARE! Just called front office. Stove/oven not working. Told me it's not an emergency because it's after hours. Six o'clock and I have to feed my family and I can't have it looked at until Monday! Unbelievable. Dish washer hasn't worked in over a week  so having to hand dry dishes. Told us last week we will have a new one. Smell of burning rubber coming off appliances. Washing machine is on the verge of breaking down. I've had it with this apartment  due your research!
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,Been a tenant for almost a year. Crappy maintenance and landscape maintenance. Watch where you step! Dog park not maintained and not deodorized. Maintenance does not show up for scheduled repairs. Garbage including liquor bottles strewn all over because they don't pick up for weeks. Dog poop on property not picked up for months. Look carefully at your actual apartment. What they promise in the models is not what you get when you move in. Crime rate very high. Anyone can get in. Day time robberies  rapes and break ins. Homeless people wash up in the pool. Car break ins  and homeless/drug people roam the unsecured parking lots. Entry gate is always either open or broken. As for appliances  well  as long as they can put a band-aid on it  it's good. Washer nearly broken  fridge has been serviced many times  went without heat for 12 days because they couldn't get part. Nice people at the office  but I don't trust them.
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,I've been living here for 6 months and I honestly really like it so far! The complex feels safe and the staff are very sweet! It's the best apartment I've lived in so far.  Yes the appliances aren't cutting edge and it's not located in downtown Summerlin  but its also not priced like that. As far as the VALUE of the apartments with what we get for the affordable rent  it's definitely worth the 5 stars in my book!  Also! I love how pet friendly they are here. I haven't noticed a dog poop problem like some other reviews  but if there is one it's not the apartments fault anyway  it's messy tenants!  And always having dogs around to say hi to makes up for it. :)
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,I wish I never did business with these frauds. Beware Bernard in the front office will actually stand in your face like he wants to challenge his own tenants. I was explaining that the property is covered in dog shit everywhere and im sick of it. He just argued with me and challenged everything I had to say. I did not feel comfortable in my own apartment. Very bad company.
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,I've lived at Oasis for almost three years and just had to end my lease to relocate to another state. When I first moved here  it was managed by a different company.  The property went through some changes in management and for a few months the rating I would have given would barley have been 3 stars. Fortunately a new management team (Danielle and Yvonne) was brought in and really turned things around. They had their work cut out for them when they first arrived with quite a few issues that had been neglected after the month or so transition. Anytime I have had an issue both were very accessible and dealt with it immediately. I remember a few months ago  I was noticing that the landscape company they were using seemed to be neglecting the area around my building. I talked to Yvonne and Daniel about it and they informed me that they were concerned about it as well and took pictures to send to the landscaping company. I thought that it would take a few weeks to see a change  but I was blown away to see that the very next day the entire area around my unit was taken care of. I have had other issues that were dealt with and handled just as fast and in an extremely professional and pleasant manner.   As for the apartment unit itself...this is the only apartment I've ever stayed in for more than one year.  The residents are predominately older and mature and I have never had a problem with noise or loud music. A big concern with any apartment is pest control. In the three years there  I never had a single issue or even saw one roach.  This is not the case with other properties from what I noticed when I first moved to Vegas and tried to decide on where to live.   I was surprised to see so few reviews on this place  because I know that there are quite a few residents that have lived here for over five years. I think that the reason for that is the fact  as I mentioned before  most of them are older and they might not use yelp as often as younger people do. But if you are looking for a quite place to live that has an extremely friendly and accommodating management team  this is the place.  Thank you Yvonne and Danielle
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,First  parking was a bit of an issue!   Free upgrade to a large drink for either a yelp or facebook check in.   Ordered a classic black milk tea and thai milk tea!  Place was clean and had free wi-fi. Their service was unremarkable.   Our drinks both had a large amount of ice  but tasted good. The tapioca pearls were also cooked nicely. However I don't think there is anything special about this place. Will have to scout for another boba go to.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The drinks and vietnamese desserts here are bomb!!  Worth the price and I will be a regular here when I'm in town.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Some friends from out of town told me about this place  they raved and raved about this drink. Of course I had to see what it was all about. Its a cute  little shop with lots of choices as far as drinks. They have boba  smoothies and dessert drinks. I tried the #4 and my friends had the #10. Mine was more tart while thiers was more creamy. They were all filled with a lot of yumminess. Mine had lychee  grass jelly  red tapioca and jackfruit. It was definitely filling and tons of flavor.   In the mood for a great Asian dessert/drink check this place out. You will want to go back and try other ones.  I DID...we went again today and I got the #10
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"This was my first experience with Vietnamese desserts/drinks. The options are rather similar and there were several ingredients I didn't recognize  so it was difficult to order without really studying the contents in each of them. However  the girls were very kind and answered all my questions as I formed my decision.  I settled on #1 Bambu Special ($4.50): Coconut  pandan jelly  longan  basil seed  and coconut juice. I opted for the Large for $1 more  but it was surprisingly filling  so I'd recommend the larger size for sharing. I didn't care for Longan  described as a fruit similar to Lychee; it seemed more ""earthy"" in taste (though I am not very fond of Lychee either). The pandan jelly was chewy  delicious  and very fun to eat and the basil seeds reminded me of chia seeds  so I loved it. The coconut  although tasty  was very cumbersome since it was one very large  long slice. The coconut juice/water had a touch of welcomed sweetness. Overall  it was a nice  refreshing drink.  I'm intrigued to try other elements  but the menu doesn't really have a single Che that appeals to me since I don't like longan  lychee  or beans (in desserts). I haven't seen a lot of information about customizing your own Che  but hopefully you can?  The place was nice to hang out  but in the mid-afternoon  the sun fiercely heats up the shop (and most of its tables)  so the only refuge was the couch/lounge area by the television. One couch appeared broken since its cushions would sink immediately upon sitting. The other couch was located directly under the television where the location of its speakers (and loud music videos) made it difficult to hear conversation. That left a wooden bench.  Anyway  I would love to create my own Che because I love the concept and several of the ingredients. Otherwise  I don't really have a reason to return."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love going to Bambu and getting the Che. I stopped by as I vacationed in Vegas and has got to say  THE SERVICE IS SO SLOW! I came back another time because I like the drinks but always had to wait about 10 minutes for my drinks. There are only 2 workers here  so if you have the time to wait  then going here would be fine  Other than the slow service  the drinks and Che were great and the atmosphere was very chill
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place is pure perfection!  Unbelievable boba smoothies. The coconut and strawberry smoothies with boba are the best I've ever had.  This place is the new standard for boba spots!!!!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,These guys rock.  Every time I'm in Vegas it a tradition to grab a couple desserts after dinner from any where.  But we have to come here and eat some funcky tropical flavs coco jelly  bail seed  coco juice  dried longon  dried lycee.  All thess color concoction of that sort of look like a lava lamp that it floats and dances around until I get my fav on top then start eating   EaTING HALFWAY  I
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I am so happy I ran into this place!  I've been a fan of their drinks and desserts ever since I had the pleasure of enjoying their selections of Vietnamese desserts in the Bay Area.  I like item #3 Che Thap Cam combo.  I will make time to sample the others....
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,4/5 for the prices  in the month of january everything was $3  but now the cheapest thing would be $3.50. Some of the items I say would deserve that price but I got a large vietnamese coffee and it ended up being over $5 bucks.   5/5 service is good  the girl up front is really nice and your drinks come out on time  5/5 drinks desserts... I cant complain!  5/5 atmosphere  you can also come out and just hang. I have brought my laptop here and also brought friends just to play some card games.  Give it a shot! especially try the Che Desserts  worth it!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I have been to Bambu in Houston and San Francisco and love the dessert there. I was really excited about the one in Vegas until I tried it. It was just OK. The service is not friendly. Although I had a good time with my friends  I think we mostly really enjoyed the V-pop music instead of our dessert. My friends however love their orders because it's their first time trying Vietnamese dessert.   I will return but I hope the food gets better next time.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Che is just so great! Good ambience in the shop as well.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Right when we walk in  we were greeted promptly. the lady cashier very friendly and funny. the fact she was very friendly and helpful. She gave us ideas as first timers to what would be good to drink.   the viet coffee blend is good and sweet. kinda strong but yummy.  #6 on the menu is like HALO-HALO for us Filipinos/islanders. great taste  mix of fruit and delicious   taro coconut is on point with taste. I say it's off the chart and better than most place. you can taste the taro then the coconut pops out if no where like WOW!  Caramel blend is okay  super sweet and super strong.  the environment is bright and welcoming. by the restroom hallway there is a little lounge area. bench and 2 couches that are pretty clean. the whole place is clean actually. the music is really up beat. the only downside would be the fan over us at the moment. problem is that the fan is under the light  so it looks like the light is flickering.   overall great first time here. thumbs up and 5 star for this place.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,i was going to hot and Juicy i been wanting to try this place for a while  we had a 30 min wait so we went in here   I ordered the strawberry smoothie with boba  first time trying this so i was excited since ive been craving it  well first off i thought it was going to be sweet or at least have flavor... but Nope :( i was so disappointed it was so bland and no strawberry flavor  not even my kids would drink it. & let me tell u these kids of mine are fattys they love to eat lol. another thing that disappointed me was that i informed the lady when ordering that it was my first time here  she didn't even recommend anything all she said was ok the board has everything on it. ummmm.... okay? Thanks?....  I highly doubt giving this place another chance .  nor would I personally recommend it i am bummed cuz it had so many great reviews...
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Love this place  refreshingly delicious drinks and Vietnamese Che!  Pick your own ingredients
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I ordered the Che ba Mau and was pleasantly surprised at how traditional the dessert was. It was delicious! Overall the restaurant is very clean and well decorated. The service was great and the coffee was scrumptious as well!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Great addition to spring mountain.  Some of the ice coffee spots are a little disappointing in town  this is one of the better spots.  A little sweet for some people  but I loved it.    Will def have to try the other deserts  they look fantastic.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I grew up with che and love the mixture of grains  legumes  jellies  seaweed  and anything else you can think of to throw into this dessert. Most of the time  it is a decadent dessert with rich coconut milk and when done wrong can be overtly sweet. Bambu on the other hand goes the opposite route and the coconut milk is too diluted and there is only a hint of sugar. I am not the type that searches for diabetes  but some flavor would be nice.  I like the presentation and the overall appeal of the place. The shop is small  but has adequate amount of seats for a quick dessert shop. The place is bright and welcoming. The music is heavily Korean driven. Once they get themselves sorted out with the ratio and product  this place has the potential to be a cool hang out spot.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place is a joke  they pre make everyone of their drinks and it sits there stale  eww!  They never ever have #7 and they always have an excuse saying that they don't have it available  take it off the damn menu lol  This place is just a crappy franchise of the original bamboo in California  don't be fooled!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This spot is a place I crave so much I will drive down to China town just for them.   I first experienced bambu in Oahu while visiting my boyfriend's family.  I was so excited when I found one here  I could barely contain myself.  Although now I'm spoiled by its presence and wish for one on the south side as well.  It is located next to hot and juicy  and in a small parking lot  the inside is modern  cheery  and clean.  Also a good amount of tables to sit at unlike some boba/ dessert drink spots.  I specifically like to get the dessert drinks  and I'm in love number 6! It's so refreshing and filled with a fun mix of textures and colors.  I believe they mix coconut water with coconut milk for the base   which makes it lighter than the normal Vietnamese dessert drink and also it's not to sickenly sweet.    My boyfriend had gotten their passion smoothie I believe  the flavors were nice  but that was too sweet for me.  I personally only have eyes for one section of their menu anyway since I only get to go so often lol. I'm sure you can ask for adjustments on sweetness levels.  Whoever is at the counter is always super nice  and I am sure they will accommodate your needs.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,the cashier girls were fun and chatty and helpful  it was good desserts  a bit too sweet for my taste  because i forgot to tell them to put in less syrup. i would have given this place a 4 or 5 stars if i wasn't feeling like being stared down by the muscle head owner who sat nearby acting all high and mighty  i think he need a crash course in customer service skills 101. Customers come to your shop to buy your food and services  SMILE and THANKS them for the business they're bringing into your store  or go back in the kitchen and let your paying customers sit and enjoy eating their desserts
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I l've been here once and I've wanted to go back ever since! It was so good! They only annoying thing was that they didn't have some of the ingredients to the drink I wanted so I had to order another drink. What I got was still good!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I ordered the litchi smoothie! Decadent  and deserving off a return visit. Everyone else in my group loved their drinks/deserts. No complaints!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Time after time Bambu gets me to come back. The value is great for the ingredients that you get. #1 is really refreshing and it's perfect for any time of year  even winter.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Vietnamese desserts are super addicting!! They have so many options that you could choose. From all the delicious beans...to tropical fruits....to amazing jellies. You may stand there forever and read what's on the menu...or you could ask the cashier what you want and they will try and help you to recommend your drink! The customer service is super helpful and understanding of your choice of Vietnamese drinks. My favorite drink is #10....3 delicious jellies!!! (Pandan Jelly  Grass Jelly  and red tapioca) I loveee how refreshing it tastes! Not too sweet  just the right amount. Also  if you may want less sugar in your dessert  go ahead and ask them! They will make your drink  ""Just the way you love it!"" They also have milk teas  coffee drinks  or smoothies...w/ boba  as you wish. But I recommend to try their desserts! After you finally choose your dessert  sit down on their super comfy sofas  w/ a nice T.V for your entertainment...also music too  of course...! And just relax and chill w/ free wifi too! Just excellent. Btw  check in to get a free up size too!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,It was slow when I came in on a Sunday evening. Great customer service. Overall  it was a nice place to hang out and grab some refreshment. I love the drinks here! Be sure to check-in on Yelp to get $1 off of your drink.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The people here are very generous and helpful  we ordered to regular drinks and they upgraded us to the big size for free. The drinks themselves are great also. Recommend the Thai tea smoothie  instant classic
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Parking may be a pain in the butt sonce it's such s small parking lot shared with Hot & Juicy but it's so worth it lol I'm here at least twice a week and so is my mom.  For something fruit filled and refreshing I recommend #6. It's my favorite.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"First Vietnamese dessert specialty place I've been to/seen. I took my parents after we ate at Hot N Juicy Crawfish next door and it was the perfect place to cool our palettes from the strong cajun flavors!  I had the #1 Bambu Special Dessert and it is awesome! It's super refreshing and they use great ingredients. The #1 includes longan  basil seeds  coconut meat  pandan jelly  and coconut water. Legit coconut water-- not any of the Vita Coconut Water stuff. For those of you who've had a fresh coconut before  you know what I mean! My brother got the coffee milk tea. I might not recommend that one so much... Its a little too bitter and bland but maybe it just wasn't to our taste. They also ran out of boba when we got there so I didn't get a chance to try it.  The service was really great. They let us stay until ""whenever everyone leaves"" (way after closing)  and all the servers were really nice!  Atmosphere is very much like most other boba places- bright  free wi-fi and has lots of seating. They're also great for groups and family friendly.  They played Vietnamese Pop on the tv which I thought was funny because they remind me a lot of Kpop groups  but that's just a random side note. Hahah  I definitely recommend going here!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Omg yes!! Welcome to Vegas. I always go there whenever I m in sf visiting family. Now I can have their yummy desserts n drinks not far from my house. I am so excited. I have no doubt you will do well in Vegas
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I've been getting my Bambu fix from Rowland Heights in California. When I saw Bambu had opened up in Vegas  I welcomed it with open arms. I usually get the dessert drinks here. It's in the same plaza as Hot and Juicy so you can walk next door after a meal. I have tried #1  #2  and #6 in Rowland Heights and #2 and #6 here in the Vegas location.   #1 Bambu Special includes coconut  pandan jelly  logan  and basil seed. With coconut meat and coconut water. I think the drink can best be described as refreshing and more on the lighter side. Includes a long strip of coconut meat which is just awesome for a coconut fan like me. Some may find this a bit bland if you need a sugar fix but I like the flavor when I'm not craving something intense or sweet.   #2 Combination includes red bean  white beans  mung beans  taro  pandan jelly  pearl  jelly  with coconut milk. Holy moly! This is a lot going on in a cup. This one is my favorite so far but it is a bit intense and on the heavy side with all the beans and taro. And while drinking this thing  you don't know if you should use the spoon or the straw and you end up looking like a drunk confused dork. Oh well  it's still so good. It is quite filling so it might as well be a meal replacement.   #6 Che trai cay includes lychee  longan  red tapioca  jackfruit  palm seed  pandan jelly  jello  and coconut. This one can get very chewy with all the fruit and jelly. It's not as filling as #2 combination but is not as light as #1 Bambu special. I enjoy the fruit in this dessert drink and picking out the red tapioca and pandan jelly to chew on.   Service here is a hit or miss. I see different girls at the cashier counter every time I visit. Some are super nice and some are impatient and borderline annoying. One even got my orders wrong and didn't apologize or correct it. My recent visits have been pleasant and the super nice girls are there more often in my recent visits.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,SO STUFFY!!  So it was a very hot day & thought we could grab some refreshing Vietnamese dessert drinks & ALWAYS wanted to try this place out! We walked in & there was like NO AC!!! Or it was blowing in one LITTLE area of the small place.... the decor was bright & refreshing w/ the bamboo wallpaper.  The worker was a bit BLAHHH... but maybe it's because it was hot... but she wasn't very pleasant which isn't very pleasant when you are trying to order & enjoy your first time... I used to drive back home to get these kinds of drinks... but I think I would rather drive back o Cali for it...  #10 DESSERT DRINK $3.95 - I won't even bother to try to spell out the name... but this is usually the kind of drink I get which is pandan jelly  red seed  boba  grass jelly  & coconut milk... it was a bit too sweet & not so much like a drink... maybe if they put a little less of the fillers or got a bigger cup to at least have more ice to keep it cold throughout it may taste better.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Unlike tea station  customer service is actually amazing! The lady at the front was so sweet and helpful and made sure we knew what we're ordering. Even gave me a sample of whatever it is (I don't remember the name lol)   She brought our drinks out and I'm honestly in love!! The Lychee smoothie without any milk was so refreshing.    I know most of these joins have similar drinks but this place have exceptional customer service therefore I recommend it before any other place in china town
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I think almost every culture in the world has developed a way to combine something sweet with something icy  whether it be in a drink or dessert form  for example gelato or bubble tea. Which brings me to Bambu. This small cafe sells a variety of sweet desserts in cup form also known in Vietnamese culture as Che. I've been here many of times  and suffice to say  I've always enjoyed coming here.  Bambu is a really big franchise  and this is the only location in Vegas. Whenever I go to other cities  and want a smoothie or something  people always recommend to me Bambu. So far  I have not tried any of the milk teas or smoothies at the Las Vegas location  but will someday. I think. Probably not.  I like coming here for the Che. Probably because its cold  not too sweet  and full of yum yums. And some of those things inside of that cup are completely unfamiliar  yet intriguing. Like Basil seeds. It's hard to describe what they are  so I won't. But they are really awesome. And awesome things are really good. And they put some firm jellies in there. Almost crunchy in a way. Crunchy sweet things in a cup always make my day.  They have a little lounge inside playing some Asian music videos. Mostly just kpop and ... v-pop? I think that is the correct term  but i'm not too sure. All I know is that sometimes you can get captivated by what is on the screen. And being captivated is really good.   I'll probably be back here. I like what's going on. A lot of the flavors are unique and interesting too me  and was refreshing in a way. The staff was really nice as well. If you're looking for something a little bit different than everything else out here  Bambu is the place to go to.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,So this is different!!!  Looking for an after dinner dessert places on yelp  I came across this little place. I had never had this type of desert drinks before.  I grabbed the number 6 off the menu and not knowing what I ordered I felt like I was ordering into the food order unknown! My unknown drink came out in a boba/soda like cup with a straw and spoon. I made the mistake of jumping in with the straw first and was unable to drink anything with the amount of jelly and other assorted stuff! Make sure to stir!  The menu has quite an extensive array of drinks and desserts which I think run up to about 50 or 60 things!  The decor is a cross between lounge and cafe!! Also it's Nice and clean as well.  My drink was good  I'm not gonna lie is was ok. I saw quite a few Java drinks that looked pretty sexy and next time I'll grab one...  I think this a hit or miss kinda joint! You'll like or love it
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Bright lights. Shiny things. Grand opening signs.  Girls that look really good in yoga pants.  I can't explain why  but I do know that these are just some of the things I am hypnotically attracted to. Kinda like the blue alien from the planet Baab (Escape From Planet Earth).  So after a recent Yelp Helps event followed by a group dinner at Ramen Sora  I was ready for some sweets to end the day. But it was past regular business hour at SnowFlake  so I was really drawn to the bright lights through those large windows emanating from what I soon discovered to be a new dessert spot in Chinatown.  But I was too late. the business has closed for the day  and the cashier lady was already counting the register and getting ready to leave.  So 2 days passed and another Yelp Helps event  this time benefitting the Ronald McDonald House charity  plus an amazeball CMYE in Downtown Las Vegas.  And I finally made it to this new Vietnamese dessert spot while it is still opened. The interior is very clean  brightly lit and has some comfy looking couch seating near the back. Their menu is pretty extensive.  Offering Vietnamese desserts  blended coffee  milk tea  smoothies and cold and hot beverages.  Tonight I was most interested in checking out their Vietnamese desserts (Che). After a brief glance at their menu I settled for the trusty #1 Bambu Special  which is made with young coconut  pandan jelly  longan  basil seed and coconut water.  I really enjoyed the longan and slurping the basil seeds and pandan jelly  but I thought the crushed ice diluted the coconut water too much.  I barely tasted it.  What I did like is the fact that they use good ingredients and fresh when available.    What I like: * Use of quality ingredients. * In Chinatown next to Hot 'n Juicy (the location closest to Decatur). * Clean!!! Or at least the appearance of being clean. * You can customize the desserts adding or removing ingredients to suit your taste or craving.  What I didn't like: * Too much crushed ice diluted the flavor of the dessert drink I ordered. * Parking lot is tiny and usually full.  Must be all the massage customers. Street parking on the side street is usually occupied  so you can find parking but will have to do more walking.  I will definitely comeback to check out other menu items  but for now I am only going to rate them worthy of 3 stars.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Stumbled upon this place accidentally after eating at Hot n Juicy. I've seen and read about it on Yelp before but never sought out to find it and try it. But I was pleasantly surprised that it was right next to where I was eating and I was excited to try it.   The place itself is a cute little spot with just the right amount of everything. Theres a little cute lounge area with a tv and a coffee table to socialize. A chair and table area for drinking and benches along the front windows across from the ordering desk to wait for drinks togo.   The menu is overwhelming but delightful there is a big board to the side with pictures of dessert drinks which helps if you just want to point and choose. Which I did and I ordered the #4 with who knows what in it  I just liked the way it look because it was (so pretty) but it was actually really good with mung beans  jelly shaved ice and other stuff. Not too sweet just perfect. Also don't forget to check in I did and I got a free size upgrade.   The prices were amazing we ordered I dessert-Che  a Thai tea  a boba drink and a blended ice latte and it was $18 for all 4 drinks. Which brings me to my 4 star rating. I enjoyed everything about my visit but wasn't sure about the counter girls humor. I don't know if she was being rude or just trying to be funny. When my brother asked for suggestions and recommendation (which was very short sweet and simple not long and complicated) and when all he wanted was a blended ice coffee she said ""no we don't have ice coffee just Latte... Have you ever had ice latte before it taste like latte!"" LMFAO really? That helps  not saying we've never tasted latte before but if we haven't we surly now know after asking her. Anyway she wasn't bad just didn't get it. But besides that I will definately come back again to try their many other drinks but the ones that we did get were all so good."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I am so excited to have found a place that has the icy asian fruity jelly desserts usually only found in Asia. It has all the Asian smoothies and boba drinks that other places do  but the desserts are what sets it apart in my mind. I haven't had one since the last time I was in Bangkok. Love it!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Even though I'm from SoCal  this was the first time I tried a drink from Bambu. I've always seen my friends upload pictures of drinks from Bambu but I never got the chance to try it. So after dim sum  we wanted to get desserts before we head back to San Diego so we stopped by here. Since it was grand opening  they had $1 off on all drinks! I looked on yelp and many people said #1  #6  and #10 was pretty popular.   After reading the reviews and asking what the cashier recommend  I decided to order #6 which is the Che trai cay - Lychee  longan  red tapioca  jackfruit  palm seed  pandan jelly  jello  and young coconut.  I don't know but the drink was ok for me. It was good but nothing really stood out other than the red tapioca. I really like the red tapioca because it had this crunchy texture to it. It was a little too much for me with all the different ingredients/topping inside. Maybe #6 was just not my taste but I'm down to try the other drinks when I get another chance!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Horrible place  so the only reason why went to his place was because I wanted a Taro Milk tea with boba. I ordered it & they didn't have boba or pudding. For that reason I would never come back to this place. Volcano Tea is the place to go
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I stopped in to get a honeydew with Boba. The cashier recommend to try the lycc jelly instead. And this mix was really good I will be going back to get this again. Thank you for the great service.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"I absolutely have to visit Bambu when I visit Vegas. The fruits in the Bambu drinks are fresh and delicious--the exact recipe for keeping cool on a hot  Vegas day. I order the #1 because I am a big fan of coconut juice and basil seed! Imagine your favorite ""Asian"" drink ingredients combined into the perfect Vietnamese dessert (che)."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Bambu took your ordinary Vietnamese dessert  added some jazz and put it into a cup served with a boba straw. Props to them for this new concept. The barista highly pushed for us to try the Bambu special #1  I opted for the #10 and was glad I did.  I sampled my friend's #1 and it was too watered down and didn't have enough sweetness to it. The #10 had a good amount of sugar but was still lacking the ""oompth""  to make it something I'd come back for. It was just basically three different types of jelly with coconut milk and ice.  I would be interested in trying their boba smoothies next time though. The white leather seating area with the K pop music in the background was a nice flair if you wanted to sit and hang out."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,A rare Vietnamese dessert (Che) place in Las Vegas. It's a great place to get a dessert/drink. Absolutely love Bambu.  I would have given 5 star if the parking lot could be bigger.  - Parking: the packing lot is kinda small. - Service: the staff here are nice and friendly.   - Price: $4/small and $5/large or Free upgrade to large size with Yelp Check In. - Che Dessert: tried #3  4  5  6  9 and 10.  My favorite is #9. Love their pandan jelly.  So far I've returned 4 times just in a week.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"I went to here today  and I was so disappointed with their service. I ordered a smashed avocado to enjoy  however  it was so disgusting. They used super old avocados to make the deserts. As you know that the color of avocado is green  and it should be green in the restaurants or in the dessert services; nevertheless  my Smashed Avocado was so brown and so dark here. Speaking of its taste  I think I don't need to describe it further for your convenience because I know that you can imagine how it  the taste of discolored avocados  looks like. After trying to have couple spoons to make sure about my order  I could not wait for throwing it into the garbage box. I noticed that they got a ""C"" ranking from the Health Department Inspection after throwing my dessert away. I will give here a Zero Star for their service."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love this place :) the best dessert in town!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,It's a Bambu in Vegas! Woot! Located next door to Hot and Juicy Crawfish  the parking lot is small. It's a clean little spot to stop in and pick up my fav Avocado smoothie with pandan jelly. In and out  and back in town  to partaaaay  with the energy from my Bambu treat.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I first tried this place in Portland  Oregon  so when I first saw it here I was extremely excited! This is my new favorite drink stop. The place is clean  cute  and a great price. Drinks are an average of $4. The most popular drink there is #6. I have tried that and #10 which has just a few less ingredients. Both are good but my favorite has to be #9 which has pandan jelly  grass jelly  and coconut milk. This drink is simple and delicious. I'll be back soon BAMBU...
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Great service and awesome desserts. A must stop place to go to. Clean atmosphere and plenty of room to sit.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,A must stop in place for me when I'm in town  awesome desserts & drinks!  My favorite is the # 3 on the wall menu  3 color cold drink (Che 3 Mau).
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,A piece of San Jose in Vegas.  Service is great and orders come out fairly quickly.  The only problem is that the flavor/taste is inconsistent sometimes. They tend to be bland every now and then.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,My first time trying this place was in Hawaii. They're a franchise that was brought in  but definitely a decent place overall.   I loved this place in Hawaii and went there twice because I knew I couldn't get what I wanted back in Vegas but now that they're here I can!   You can try anything and it'll be at least decent. Just keep an open mind when trying new things! Otherwise there are always your safe options! =] I love getting drinks here and they even have fresh passion fruit juice! (one of my favorite fruits)  Most people don't understand Asian places  but they're always bound to get marked off for something from the health department. Although some of it was just ridiculous  I'll still probably wait a little while before going back after my initial couple of visits.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,My fave vietnamese dessert place! The cashier in the front  I believe her name was Nina  was super nice and knowledgable about the menu.  She recommended me a #1 with red tapioca and it is now my new favorite drink! Thanks for being so nice Nina.  Great customer service & great drinks! Definitely going to try their vietnamese coffee next time.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was THIS close to going to Tea Station again when I decided to review my bookmarks and then it hit me  Bambu is right there too! So had my boyfriend swerve  do a u-turn  drive around until we found a parking spot (Hallelujah!) & yaaaas  we finally arrived!  I knew I wanted something different so I opted for a number 5 from the desserts section: Avocado  coffee dark brick jelly  boba & combo jelly. The concept reminded me of Halo-Halo  a Filipino dessert. I stirred that ice around like a boss and slurped the yummy concoction. Mmm  so creamy and love that it didn't taste artificially sweet. There wasn't one sip where I didn't have any of the toppings cause the dessert drink is filled with what seemed like an endless amount of toppings. The boyfriend ordered Mango Dazzle with boba and his was yummy as well. But we were blown away by #5!   Had a free large upgrade with Yelp check-in  the server was helpful & friendly & music was on point. Parking sucks.. like really bad. We got super lucky so be prepared. Or just do a to-go cause that has separate parking spots.   Will be back soon! :)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is a great place for shaved Vietnamese dessert in Las Vegas' chinatown!  Last time I came here was after lunch at the Hot and Juicy next door. Upon entering I was greeted. The place was small but tidy with a lengthy menu of their specialty desserts listed on the wall above the register. I ordered a #5. It was delicious but thick and heavy from the avocado. Next time I plan on trying something a bit more lighter.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"If you want ATTITUDE and TERRIBLE SERVICE  this is the place to go. Some people can disregard that if they're really just after the thing they want to buy  but seriously  never in my life have I experienced the worst. Have you ever seen an employee throw things at a customer and threaten to beat them up? Yes  KHONG did that.   (This is a long  descriptive story  but all the details are so important.)  So my sister and I ordered drinks. Khong came out with regular sized-drinks. My sister (in an innocent tone) said  ""oh  I asked for a large..."" and immediately  Khong passive-aggressively snapped and took the drinks to the back. I tried to stop her midway because I actually wanted a regular. I don't see why she couldn't just give me my drink. Khong did not want to listen to my sister who was trying to stop her to say it was okay and that she would have accepted the regular. The point is  my sister noticed that Khong did not make the drinks to begin with since she was at the front. There is swiveling door to the back where Khong went  so my sister was simply not gonna have the drink at all  assuming Khong must've ""messed"" with the drinks. (EVEN if Khong did not  what Khong did was completely unnecessary). Another kicker to it was while all of this was happening--my sister loudly saying she wanted to stop Khong from doing anything with the drinks that were already made--there was another employee at the front  some filipino-looking female with heavy eyeliner--who played dumb pretending not to listen when clearly my sister was trying to stop Khong. The silent girl took the drinks Khong made from the back and gave it to us. Coming from a service industry  if I was in the silent girl's position  I would have felt ashamed and apologize for my co-worker (Khong's) behavior  but apparently  she condoned it. Moreover  Khong threw straws over the serving counter from the back. Was that necessary?   So Khong comes out and completely ignores us and takes care of another order while my sister still wants to have a word with her  simply to ask Khong why she couldn't just listen to her and give the drinks as they were without going to the back. Also  my sister calmly asked why it was necessary to have that kind of attitude. My sister also stated  ""If you're miserable at this job  then why don't you work somewhere else? You don't need to have that kind of attitude."" As Khong has her back on us  she shoots back over her shoulder with  ""I don't need to listen to you  you're not my mother!"" Meanwhile  silent girl is still playing dumb. My sister was still saying a few words. Khong snaps with ""I gave you guys a free upgrade"" and other profanities. My sister said that's not the point. She distrusted the fact that Khong went to the back to re-make the drinks  assuming they'd be contaminated. So while the two were fussing  the silent girl was ordered by Khong to give my sister a refund.  Oh  I forgot to mention  while the silent girl wore makeup and looked decent for work  Khong was in a messy half bun  wore a wife beater with a small hole in the middle  and raggedy sweat pants. She looked like she just rolled out of bed and got to work. I'm not trying to judge what she wears  but REALLY--is that acceptable for an employee to wear?  The intensity rises. My sister finally blurted out ""F*** you."" Khong shot back with other profanities and said ""Say f*** you to me again!"" (My sister did). So they go back and forth and Khong says  ""Come here  so I can fuck you up."" (Directing my sister to come to the side of the counter). My sister says  ""No  you come here  since YOU want to fuck me up."" Khong continually threatened my sister and told her to ""Get the f*** out of MY store"" even though we were already on our way out. My sister shoved the drinks from the customer counter onto their side and rushed out but Khong threw something at my sister (but missed).   I wish I had recorded the thing. What kind of employee would do that to a customer? Some Asians can throw some major attitude  but the most you'll be met with is passive-agression. Khong is something else--with that 360 attitude over a mistaken size  the unnecessary throwing of straws  bitching at a customer making the customer feel like she did a favor by ""upgrading"" for free (with cooties maybe)  threatening to beat up the customer AND throwing something at the customer? That is completely unacceptable. I'm also appalled that the silent girl couldn't even intervene to correct things. What an embarrassing establishment.   There are better tasting dessert/drink places on Spring Mountain with friendlier service and are far from the ghetto that is this place. I would name the places I personally prefer but I'm not paid to do so and that would take away the merit of this review. Choose carefully."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,wasn't one of the best boba visits I've had here in town. there are other places that have better quality products.  they did just open up a few months ago  so I'd give them a while to find their niche and offer something Vegas doesn't already have.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,It's ok. The flavor wasn't quite there in my dessert (#3) & my hazelnut mocha slush  but that doesn't mean I hated it. It's just a place I would go to if I had cravings. Service was ok as well.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We stopped by after having dinner at a nearby ramen spot. I have been a frequent customer at another location in California and love theor drinks. Since the weather was a little cool and breezy  I wanted to end the night with hot thai tea  which I've ordered numerous times in other places but they didn't have it on the menu  only as a cold milk tea or smoothie. I asked the lady at the front if they can nake it hot and she said that they can but it might taste odd since it's not meant to be made that way. Again I have had this drink done before and when I got it  it tasted the same.  I guess she's just never had it hot personally but it'a just peculiar to call one of your drinks odd-tasting.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I goto almost all the Bambu around me so I grabbed one before I head back to LA. This place just open so everything looks new and nice. Customer service was not bad either I guess. They have several tables for you to hang out which is nice.   I always get either three from them: 1. Che 3 Mau 2. Avocado Smoothie 3. Avocado smashed  So this time I went with avocado smoothie plus my favorite topping  pendan jelly. When I first saw the color of the jelly  it looked different. It was not bright green like most places. It didn't quite taste exactly the same like other Bambu either...but the smoothie was good. I did ask for less sweet and I didn't taste sweet at all. I thought the jelly was more chewy than usual.   I guess I'd come back since it's only 3 mi~ away from the strip and I love Bambu in general. But I'd still prefer the one in LA more.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Their number #1 special isn't the same as the  original in Orange County. It's too sweet and maybe they just put in sugar water instead of coconut water like the original place.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We've become regulars here. Very southeast asian dessert theme. I had number 14 it was delicious. Free up size for checking in on yelp or faxebook
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was so happy when this place opened in Vegas; not that I live in Vegas  but it is definitely closer than Cali where I first had it.  In case you have never step foot into a Bambu  Bambu is a place that specializes in Vietnamese dessert drinks called che.  They also have others drinks as well such as smoothies  milk teas  coffee  etc. but mainly they are known for their che.  My favorite Bambu drink is the #1 Bambu special.  It is made with coconut water  coconut meat  pandan jelly  logan and basil seed.  It is unbelievably refreshing and delicious.  I am seriously addicted to the pandan jelly!!! If I don't order the #1  I will get anything with the pandan jelly.  I have also heard their Vietnamese iced coffee is one of the best.  I am not into coffee  but I would certainly recommend it to all the coffee fanatics.  It's such a bummer they don't have one in Colorado.  However  I am hopeful because they have brought In-N-Out as well as Voodoo donuts *crosses fingers*.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I know BAMBU is a chain  but I enjoyed my experience at this particular location  so I will write a brief review for it. Ordering and getting my dessert was quick. I got the Che Trai Cay ($4.25) which has all my favorite fruits and jellies... lychee  longan  red tapioca  jackfruit  palm seed  pandan jelly  jello  and coconut.   BAMBU has every sort of combination dessert possible. When you think about it  the desserts are way more filling than the milk teas for a better price  so keep that in mind. I'm always unsure of what to order  but everything is good!   This location has plenty of tables and chairs to hang out and even a little lounge furniture area for those who need a little more unwinding with their beverage or dessert. Overall great place to just chill and get a midday or after dinner snack.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place was horrible .. the cashier seemed so disinterested in helping us. There was about 6 of us and she looked annoyed when we walked in.  She didn't explain anything or asked if it was our first time.  The drinks were also tasteless and some of us just threw it out.  Won't be coming back here.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love it! I've tried a lot of the che's they have on the menu and haven't been disappointed. Could be a bit sweet.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love this place!  They offer one of my favorite desserts. I always seem to order the #4 it's a variety of tapioca and jellies mixed with coconut milk and ice.  It's so refreshing and not too sweet.  Aside from the yummy desserts I absolutely love that at any given point in time they are playing kpop videos inside :)  the only reason I can't give this place 5 stars is because of the parking lot situation.  It is right next to hot and juicy crawfish and most of the time it is impossible to find somewhere to park.  Because of this   it makes getting their desserts a little inconvenient.  Other than that though   I would highly recommend to friends because they have an extensive menu of unique treats!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I stopped by here a few times now to get my Vietnamese dessert fix. The first time was probably the most memorable for me  as the cashier was this smoking hot Asian guy with a charismatic personality. (I wonder if he's single???)   A habitual animal that I am  I always opted for the usual combo: red beans  coffee jelly  red tapioca and mung beans. Their desserts always hit the spot for me and I tend to replace my dinner by eating just this. It is that filling. The quality seems consistent every time as well.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,who doesn't like BAMBU DRINKS!!! We were tired and beat  hydrated and stress out from all the casinos fast pace of Las Vegas. Needed a place to cool down and relax this place has it all. The ambiance and atmosphere is a nice and casual place with free WiFi comfortable leather self us and updates music. Right in the middle of Chinatown this place it's a treasure if you can find it.  We ordered two rounds of fresh drinks. I had thier famous ice coffee perfect size of condensed milk not too much but just right I went on my laptop and surf the web. It's your asians or like Asian atmosphere upbeat music and fresh refreshing drinks that'll cool you down and relax your muscles try this place out you won't be disappointed.   Oh we spent like two hours here on them comfortable leather couch watching music video and kicking back.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Awesome Boba Place with really unique drinks! The interior is cute & clean & the vibe is very positive;)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,(Edited/Updated 11/22/2015)  They have noticeably gone downhill. On my recent visit  none of the employees were in the front. I waited over 10mins by the register to see if anyone would show up but nope. I left to a different boba shop and was warmly greeted/assisted in picking out a drink by a friendly server. Just like how it's supposed to be. Please note this happened during their business hours (around 6PM on week night). Employees are not as friendly/personable as they used to be. I still like how the drinks comes out quick. Usually less than 3 mins.   As far as the drinks goes  I only get Jasmine milk tea with boba. I always make sure to get it light sugar because their drinks are a bit too sweet for me. I have tried those dessert drinks and I'm not a fan. It's unique but it depends on personal preference. Their green tea smoothie was really good. I must say it was better than Starbuck's green tea frappucino.   Their boba used to be cooked just right. It's super inconsistent now and most of the time just a clump of mush. I noticed they run out of boba A LOT.   I don't like the parking in this plaza. The parking is so tiny and is only enough for like 10 cars...I don't like parking in front of people's houses but that's the only choice I have when I need my boba fix.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Usually go here and everything went great until my sister started throwing up and not feeling well in her stomach after drinking a drink I got her ):
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,FL Yelper here! Found this place when we ate around the area and found this gem! The place is clean  and the staff is very friendly. I had the #6  it's  really good! The fruits inside the desert/drink consist of Jack fruit  mango lychee  palm seed  jello and more!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love their hazelnut mocha extra strong!!! This Bambu is a lot nicer than the one in Santa Clara  Ca.  Will definitely come back when ever I'm in vegas!!!!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Made a pit stop here with my wife before we headed back to Cali after lunch and were not disappointed at all. I originally was looking for a good boba spot on yelp and came across this. We tried the #1 & #6 from some tips on here and were very satisfied. This just might make it on our ""must stop by"" list for whenever were out here."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,So many choices ! Cheaper than tea station and more flavor ! Very quickly  we wait only couple min ! Good service too !
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Oh yeah!   We came after some Hot N Juicy next door to wash away the garlic linger on the palette. I got a random dessert number (I believe 6) as I couldnt decide. It was pretty good. Just the right amount of sweet and was not stingy on the toppings. I was to my limit full after eating this dessert  but I do not regret my evening!    We did not eat in  but inside is simple but nice. They even have a cool fishtank with live plants  cherry shrimp  tetras and mollys.  I've been a fan of ice/milk/bean concoction desserts at Viet restaurants  but wanted to find a place with variety more than the ""three bean"" dessert. I most definitely will be back to try more desserts and try some of the beverages. So far  I am really excited that we have a place like this!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"I've never been head over heels with Vietnamese desserts  but that's not all that you can find here.  Bambu Desserts & Drinks is a Vietnamese dessert shop that originated in San Jose and now has locations in nine states  including this spot in a tiny Spring Mountain strip mall. Featuring a wide variety of fresh ingredients (tropical fruits  jellies  coconut milk  and more) in dessert soups and puddings  their featured ""che"" could still be the next big thing in desserts.  But I was in the mood for something else. It wasn't boba / milk tea either  since I have my local favorite for that already. Finally  after scrolling through umpteen descriptions of che  I found Stefany V.'s review of the Vietnamese Coffee Blend ($4.25). It was a nice smoothie of the very potent coffee  it's sweet but not too sweet  and it will give you a huge kick of caffeine. I wasn't a fan of how the actual coffee started to drain out of the ice and settle at the bottom  but it's probably fully melted away in my fridge anyway. Yeah  I had to stop myself from drinking it all  lest I stay up wired all night.  I'll explore che eventually  and I want to try Bambu's fresh passion fruit drink too. For this visit  however  a smooth and slurpable drink were good enough."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is where we go when the summer is just too hot. A very welcoming family business. Highly recommend this dessert hot spot  if your friends don't know anything about Vietnamese desserts  let them fall in love with the flavors of crack! Enjoy
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,They have a wide selection of items to choose from their menus.  And staff was friendly.  Cute little spot  But they could definitely change out their seat.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,LOVE their #10 dessert drink.  That's the only drink I have had for the two times I have been there.  The regular size is almost a meal itself but for less than $4 (excluding tax).  This is definitely a great spot to get some Vietnamese drinks/dessert!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Super smooth  creamy Taro milk tea with yummy boba. I finished it really quick. Cashier was nice  she seemed a bit shy and didn't really do much talking. Our drinks were made in less than 5 minutes. They don't have much parking. They share maybe 20 spots with a few other businesses. I would like to try their taro smoothie next time.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Yum  had the Chai Tea with coconut milk and Boba and it was delicious. Would definitely come back again to try something else.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Customer service was absolutely excellent!  We came here for the first time and really enjoyed the service as well as smoothies and iced coffee. I'd refer to anyone!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Vietnamese dessert shop with large variety of jelly dessert. I'm not vietnamese and it was quite difficult to order due to large variety and lack of explanation of the jelly. Anyways  I was able to sample 3 different dessert which were all served in 8oz plastic cup. It was quite sweet and extremely filling!!! The jelly and the beans were good and gooey  but very enjoyable. I recommend sharing one order with a friend.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I showed up right when they opened. Woops! Sorry  I had dragon breath from stinky tofu and wanted to wash it down.  Super nice chick working inside. She was very sweet. I always order the #1  and she was NOT stingy with the pandan jelly (my favorite part) Thanks for making my vacay so enjoyable and giving me more goodies than the Bambu in SF does!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Love the Bambu Vietnamese Smoothies n Desserts! Most of the Bambu Houses I already visited r very clean n comfortable to relax in while enjoyin a cup of Che Ba Mau (Halo Halo). This one in LV locate on Spring Mountain Rd is no exception! The staff's r very courteous n friendly. The prices r very reasonable even though their location is quite touristy. Can't wait to go back for their In House Special Three Color Drinks!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The cashier Khong needs to be bitch slapped... If she wants to be in the service industry  she NEEDS a total attitude adjustment. One star for the guy who made the drinks. Keep the nasty attitude up and you will see more reviews like this...shaking head!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,My need for Vietnamese desserts were finally fulfilled when Bambu opened up in Las Vegas! Wide selection of items  all fairly priced. I usually get #6  which comes loaded with various toppings - my favorite being jackfruit and red tapioca. I especially like that it's not too sweet and just the perfect amount of creamy from the coconut milk.  The service is alright  nothing special. All the employees seem quite young as well. There is plenty of seating  with outlets and a TV. They don't really mind if you hang there for a bit. The fish tank always looks like it needs a good scrubbing  though.  I've never tried anything besides the shaved ice drinks but I hear their boba and milk teas are not too bad.   The parking situation is annoying. There are very limited spaces in the lot and Hot n Juicy  which is always packed  is in the same plaza. You can park on the street adjacent  which is a very short walk away.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was excited to try this new boba spot. The cafe was clean and the service was great. I ordered four drinks of varying flavors and every single one tasted like it had been mixed with hairspray or perfume. It was super funky and left a waxy film in my mouth. No one...and I mean no one in family took more than two sips. Such a bummer and a waste of $15.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I got the #1 dessert which is the Bambu special definately recommend it. Also got the taro coconut smoothie recommend that also.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Best place in town to get a good drink. If you love boba  jelly or tea  this is the place. Try the #9  it's the best one in their menu.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The service was a bit slow. They have the cups behind the counter that looked to be filled with the main ingredients of each dessert. They then add the shaved ice and liquid (coconut milk or juice). I don't see how that took 2 minutes when me and my friend were the only ones there. I am not Vietnamese so a lot of stuff was foreign to me but I like to try new things. We got a #1 Bambu Special (coconut  pandan jelly  longan  basil seed  coconut juice) and a #6 (lychee  longan  red tapioca  jackfruit  palm seed  jello  coconut milk)  and they were both very good and we got to try a lot of new things. I wish they made a size smaller than regular though  I personally couldn't finish it all. But it was good and I suggest everyone give it a try.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Took a customer here this morning for a quick meeting over ""coffee"". We ended up each ordering a #1 dessert. It was absolutely yummy! There were some longans  coconut  basil seeds and green squiggly thingies. We both wolfed it down in no time. Service was friendly and fast (although we were there right when they opened at 10am). The guy at the counter even turned down the music for us because it was a bit too loud to carry a conversation in there. Minus 1 star for some of their seatings that are a bit worn out (i.e. the white couches)  almost fell through the thing when we sat down. Will definitely return and try all the other goodies on the menu!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The drinks at Bambu are amazing and delicious  BUT this last time I went with my boyfriend I felt so rushed to leave. The place specifically said it closes at 10pm  but they closed the doors at 9:45 and the chick behind the counter was talking to her friend on the phone  ON SPEAKER MODE  so we heard all the drama and then she came and stood one table away from us with all her stuff in her hand ready to leave at 9:59pm. We felt like we were not welcome in the business. I absolutely did not appreciate this  and it felt pretty rude especially towards a paying customer who comes here often.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,When I first walked in I noticed right a way the beautiful bambu wall. It's really nice inside. I was surprised that it was pretty packed. Then again who doesn't know Bambu :D first off the menu is the same as the other Bambus. I was afraid that the desserts here wouldn't be delish like the other Bambus. Boy I was wrong  my favorite desserts number 6 was great or maybe even better. Very friendly staff and a few cute guys in the back ;)  I will defininatly  be back to this location ever time I party in Vegas!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,First time trying their specialty drinks and they are amazing! The service is alway great! Our new fave spot!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Obsessed with the #1 but swapped out the logan fruit for lychees instead! Not too sweet overall light & refreshing. Big chunks of young coconut meat yummy!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Quick and great service. The Vietnamese coffee was excellent and tasty! Can't wait to come back and try the rest of their menu.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place is love at first taste. Enough said. I love everything here. Even my mom who is a stingy vietnamese Che (their desserts) snob has fallen in love with this place.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Really good - i would come here instead of Starbucks.  Clean  good atmosphere and the cleek was super nice . This is my new favorite coffee shop
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The drink was perfectly sweetened and the boba was very soft but still chewy  although the flavor of it was a bit weird. I just dislike the cap that they use for everything.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Good desserts and nice place to hang but bad location. Right next to Hot n Juicy (older one) which is almost impossible to find a parking.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,First time trying it... Reminds me of my childhood years..grumbing on some good Vietnamese dessert.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is THE place to go relax and enjoy some wonderful Vietnamese dessert drinks.   -The place is conveniently located in china town/ Asian food mecca. Just about 7 minutes from the strip. On a hot summer day  it is definitely worth a visit.  -It is right next to the crawlfish place  so people can come for desserts before or/and after they stuff their bellies with crawfish. Perfect combination  - The decor is modern and aesthetically pleasing. It's clean and well kept. The AC is always in full blast mode so you feel amazing walking in the place from the scotching heat outside.   - The staffs are always professional  friendly and attentive. Especially Thuy   she is awesome.  She always takes her time and explain to the customers what kind of drinks they have and help them with their selection. She always makes sure you feel like at home. Top notch customer service!!!!  -Bathrooms are always clean. One thing that tells you how clean a restaurant/bar/dessert house is the bathroom. Their bathrooms are always clean and well stocked with paper-towel and stuffs. I can only go to the men's bathroom but I am sure it is the same quality in the women's bathroom. For this alone is a thumb up for me.   -Bonus: for anyone enjoy Asian/kpop or even Viet/ American pop/rap music  they play these on a huge flatscreen TV on the wall. Very cool atmosphere!!!  -Another bonus is free wifi and the welcoming attitude of the staff if you need to do some work there for a while. For me I cannot do any work at home so I tend to go to boba/ coffee houses to do my work. And this place is one of my favorite place to do so. Plus if you go often they treat you like family :)  - I definitely recommend this place !!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is a cute little hangout spot. Different in looks from other boba/snack shops in Chinatown. There's a sitting area in the corner with couches. The selection of drinks was pretty satisfying offering different  as well as unique  flavors. But at the time of my visit (around 8pm Sunday) they ran out of boba
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I absolutely love this place!! I used to be a loyal customer to No. 1 Boba Tea in China town for years! then they stopped using real fruit and switched to powder which I was okay with at first as long as the taste was still great  but after 3 times of trying I came to a sad acceptance that my favorite boba place for 6yrs is no longer my favorite. Thanks to my need for the delicious sweet drink and chewy rice balls I found this place after a long search. They have the creamiest smoothies I've ever had  not to mention their perfectly made tapioca bubbles. I come at least twice a week on a mission to try everything on their menu  and I have to say I love it all and the best thing about this place  they use real fruit!! I am now a Bambu loyal customer.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was excited to see a Bambu next to Hot N tasty and had to give it a try.  I ordered the usual Bambu Special no sugar  but this came out way too sweet.  I get it  people don't understand the no added sugar concept.  Sigh! The saving grace was that they loaded this drink up.  The proof is in the picture.   Parking is super difficult as they share this center with the extremely busy Hot N Tasty.  It was around 9 pm and we parked in the adjacent dark residential neighborhood akin to Freddie K's neighborhood.  We ran to the car; it was a little scary.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The smoothies were delicious with great variety of toppings to add in. Great place with great service. They have vietnamese desserts  which is a new thing for me but very delicious looking and tasted great. The cashier girl recommended me many kinds of combinations for my Vietnamese dessert. Highly recommended for people who want something other than typical boba.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Thursday night and the place was dead.. My friend and I almost thought it was closed cause we didn't see anyone in there. We thought it was very strange but I decided to try it anyways since the open sign was lit... As soon as I stepped in  I knew exactly why no one was in there!!!! OMG... as I opened the door  I was hit with this strong pungent fart odor... I was so grossed out but my friend told me to ignore... I was so baffled by the smell that I even asked the cashier if she smelled it... Poor cashier said she couldn't  tell because she's been there all day...  Anyways  we both had time to kill so I ended up ordering an avocado smash and sat down to wait for our drinks. As other customer's came in  the look on their face was priceless!! It was like those funny home videos where people would play stinky pranks on one another to see their reaction!! I couldn't stop laughing! All hilarious moments aside  when I got my drink  the color of it was almost brown  I took a few sips but I was scared to get sick and just tossed it... This is probably the lowest quality bamboo I've been to! I'm not telling you not to come here since it may have just been an off day  but I probably will never come here again.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place has a bad smell that reminds me of a old sink-wipe cloth. I don't care how good their drinks are  I cannot stand a place that makes me yak.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,In what universe do I have to wait 20 minutes to get boba?? Apparently in Vegas. This place is nestled between a crawfish restaurant and a massage place in Chinatown  approximately 15 minutes from the Strip.  I love the original OC locations (including the one in Irvine) but after visiting this location once  I really figure I can get boba faster at home.   Despite being a roomy location and very clean  I'm incredibly disappointed that I had to wait almost half an hour for 2 smoothies. You get free boba here with every drink and you can upgrade for just $1 extra. The cashier was friendly enough but considering it was a Saturday and there were multiple people waiting for drinks  they only had one person in the back making drinks and one person in the front  making the place extremely inefficient.   As for the drinks themselves  I'm a huge fan of #6 off the dessert menu and the smoothies. Good consistency  and good flavor.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Their coconut milk tea is seriously off the hook! I love the decadent coconut flavor and it's not watered down at all. It is a little bit more on the sweet side  but if you drink it after the ice has melted a little bit  then it's perfect!   I also tried those grass jelly milk tea. It's very milky and not overly sweet. The grass jelly is fun to slurp up into the straw and I love the soft jelly texture.   I don't really like their boba  it's small and harder in texture than what I'm used to. I think if they cooked the tapioca pearls slightly longer it would achieve the al dente texture.   Other than that  this place is a gem for dessert drinks and I'll definitely be back to try their desserts!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place is So good. I love how there's always welcoming friendly people working  behind the counter. I got the thai milk tea and number  4 dessert. I can't wait to come back here.  Definitely a MUST try especially if you have a sweet tooth and love Vietnamese desserts.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I order The #1 special drink   i love it .  But the boba milk tea which is not good   I brother said which is not chewing   and he didn't like at all.  So I take him to buy other Boba place at Chinatown more better this place . Don't recommend to drink Boba here. But vietnamese dessert that is find .
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Everything was ok the only thing is the cashier she wasn't  friendly at all. She has attitude while taking an order  and it happened twice. The drink that I got it really good
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Solid Vietnamese dessert drinks filled with combinations of pandas jelly  taro  red bean  mung bean  coconut  etc. I typically get the #1 if I'm craving light and refreshing  (coconut water base) but get the #4 when I want something sweeter and milkier (coconut milk base). It's about $3.50 for a small and $5 for a large. You can add a scoop of durian to your drink for 50 cents (used to be free by no longer) but this can sometimes overpower the other flavors of the drink because  well  it's durian.  Tip: Asking for easy ice doesn't increase the amount of good stuff in the drink (unlike at Starbucks where it does) because the ice is piled on at the top so just order it the way it is or risk a warm drink.  Tip #2: Parking sucks because of the crawfish place right next to it so park in the residential street right beside the place. Even if their parking lot looks empty it can fill up fast and backing out is a huge pain.  Like most Asian restaurants  they don't accept American Express.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Very disappointed in quality  #43 taste like blended milk chocolate. Will not be come back to this place. I think they might be under new ownership.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is one of those places in Vegas that we have to go to everytime we are in town. We were introduced to the place by our friend who is a local in Vegas. We went on a friday night and the parking lot was packed. When we entered the shop  there were a few people only so we were served right away. After about a few minutes  we got our order. We got #6. Service is fast and prices are very affordable. It is so addicting that we went again the next day. I wish they would open more of these in LA
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,First time here and it is a cool little place to check out. I tried the black Brick milk tea with little pieces of coffee jelly. Next time I'll be brave enough to do the coconut milk drinks with jelly and fruit. Thanks for the free upgrade to a large drink just for checking in on yelp!! Too bad you ran out of boba... Meh!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Solid dessert drink. Went here today around 8pm. Completely empty  which is nice cuz in OC there would be a line out the door. My go to drink is #10  contains grass jelly and the chewy green and red jellies (sorry don't know their names hehe). After trying this place  I have to say I prefer this location over their OC one. Thats because its not overly sweet! And they give us way more jellies than ice  which I really appreciate XD
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I went their last night with terrible service. She wasn't nice at all. After we got our drinks and sat down she closed the sign right away. Actually they close at 10 or 11 right? But... It was 9 last night when we got in!   Another lady went to throw the trash and closed the door so loud. So... We will never come back!!! Sucks!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"First of all I want to comment on the appearencr...so I came here after the gym and was astonished on how amazing this place looks on the inside  it seems like the owners put alot of time and effort into this this place. everything from the decor to the counter looks so modernized yet relative to its bambu theme. This place looks like a cool place to hang out for people of all ages.  Secondly  is the drinks; so basically i just got out of the gym and wanted something to quench my thirst so i asked the countergirl  ""what's really refreshing here""? and she told me about the ""passion fruit drink "" so i ordered it...the drink was amazing and delicious it was inexplicable on how fresh the ingredience were. This is a ""must comeback"" for me especially when it gets warmer."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Cool little place for drinks and hanging out. They have WiFi and Korean pop music and music videos. Have a big menu to chose from and all drinks are delicious. Normally takes them a while though if you go during a busy time. Everybody is friendly though..  Be aware  the charge 50 cents for credit/debit cards...this was a couple weeks ago that I paid with card so not sure if they still do it  I just take cash now...
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Parking here sucks.... They really need to fix that! I tried the matcha frap which was pretty good. I could taste the green tea flavor  but I just wish there was more juice to it. After taking a few sips  all that was left was slush that you had to literally just pick up with your straw to eat/drink. I know this place is known for Vietnamese desserts but I wasn't adventurous enough to try those. Plus I didn't have the stomach capacity to either but I'll definitely give it a try next time when I'm looking for dessert.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I tried number 9 - grass jelly and pandan jelly with coconut milk. It was good at first but got too sweet after awhile. I'll try something else the next time I'm here. This place is new and clean.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"I don't know how they manage to make the drinks taste flavorless and gross at the same time. but then again  they already prep their ingredients in cups and place them in the coolers so who knows how long they've been in there. Soooo not fresh :( the place looks unsanitary and the staff seems either bored or lazy. Every time I order it seems like it's the hardest thing they've done all day. Not to mention it's super awkward when they have their friends over the counter having their ""girl talks"" while I'm ordering. Sorry to interrupt the convo.. but yeah nope totally not coming back"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,It's like finally we have a Vietnamese dessert place but sadly not what I expected. I went here twice. what sucks is that if you use card it's always a fifty cents fee. The first time I was here i ordered #6 because of the word Jack fruit. The dessert had less fruit in it. It was mostly ice  coconut  and green jelly that blended in with the ice. I guess because Viet dessert is known for its coconut? The second time I ordered #20 because of lychee. Again I got mostly ice and less of the items that were suppose to be in it. I probably come back  but I will ask for less ice if that will work.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,First time here. Got a Strawberry Banana smoothie. Had it made with coconut as I have a bad gallbladder. Smoothie tastes very good  service was excellent. Nice little seating area  flat screen tv playing music videos. Even some comfy chairs!!!! .... Eager to try Boba once my gallbladder is removed and I've recovered from the surgery. Got a free upgrades in size for checking in with Facebook!!!....I'd SAY more accurate rating is 4.5 stars
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Ordered the mocha blend #43 with boba. Tested right on cue like the other spots in northern Cali which isn't a bad thing. The young girl on the cash register was very nice/helpful when I asked her some questions. It was dead when I was there so it didn't take long at all to get my drink. Tuesday/9pm-ish
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Decided to give this place a try. Upon entering the location  it was very busy. After ordering  the wait for the actual drinks/desserts was rather quick. I can appreciate a busy efficient place like Bumbu.  My daughter finished her whole order. She is a very picky eater/drinker so that says a lot. It was also a hot uncomfortably humid day. Our trip to Bumbu cooled us off. We were refreshingly satisfied!  Will definitely return when  in town!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was pleasantly surprised with this new boba location! I usually go to the Tea Station but this place is a whole lot cheaper by like $2 bucks or so. I did go to one of the Bambu Desserts & Drinks location over in the far west in Honolulu Hawai'i but this one was seemed cleaner.   Service was great  boba was delicious and flavor was excellent.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Needed a place for boba and I've found it! Always fast nice and most important clean. When I moved from la I was on a mission to find a place that had boba that was actually good. I actually found this place on Yelp like I do every other place and I'm happy I did no complaints here and I've been more than a handful of times. I wish the parking lot was bigger lol but that's it
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Not bad! Definitely reminds me of halo halo with the difference being that I actually like the stuff inside. Would like to try the boba next time!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I had high hopes since I had been to Bambu in the Bay Area. The drinks were quite watery and not tasty. I'm hoping that they'll get better at creating the desserts since they just opened.  Parking lot is also tiny so you might have to park in the side street.  On the plus side K-pop videos kept me entertained!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I went to this place on a whim as I had a craving for boba. It's a cute lil drink shop. The menu is unique for beverages. I went with #6 which had jackfruit and gulaman. It was tasty  if I go back I'll try other drinks. The one thing that's a negative about this place is the location and lack of parking  nothing against the business . some people obviously should drive a car if they can't park correctly.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Nothing more I like than coconut juice  grass jelly  and all the other varieties of Che  the Vietnamese sweet drinks.  There are too many combinations - it all depends what you like if you want coconut juice or a more rich coconut milk base.   If you like red bean  grass jelly  longan  you can pretty much find every combination or have it custom made.  I always like to get the ice on the side so I can scoop it as I please.   I would give this place 5 stars but i ve been to a few other locations outside Vegas and the ingredients are a little better. Still  I'll be coming back here.   There's a check in deal to upgrade to a large.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Thuy the cashier was super sweet. It was our first time here and she recommended drinks for us. The drinks were interestingly weird but still good.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,i would come back because the service was so great!!! thanks nina and khong and cindy for helping me out!!!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Solid Vietnamese drink/dessert place. There aren't that many places that serve che in town  and I like all the options here for an alternative to East Asian desserts. I also like that the drinks aren't too overpoweringly sweet.  Prices are a bit higher here though for a single item  but generally still less than $5 per item  which I am willing to pay.   There are seats for dining in and service here has always been fine. Interior is clean and functional. The parking lot isn't the biggest  but it shouldn't be an issue since it never seems to get too crowded here.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Love this place. Fresh fruits drinks  we are here every weekend. Ordered almost all of their drinks and all are very good.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I've been to several Bambu locations in Southern California. This Las Vegas location is significantly better than the others in service  cleanliness  taste and price.   They offer a checkin offer for 1$ off and also have two different sizes to choose from.   I always order the #10: red tapioca  grass jelly  pandan jelly with a coconut milk and crushed ice base. I really wish all the locations would provide you with more crushed ice because oftentimes it melts too quickly or the beverage is too sweet.   Will definitely stop by on future trips :)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I heard about this place in California Becuase it's very popular where I'm from in the Bay Area. This place has been open quite a long time now and I go here Becuase of their red tapioca pearls. Definetly the best when thy make their smoothie it's never watered down. Mango and the raspberry is a great flavor. I also add the boba pearls with red pearls in the mix. I don't usually go here often. But when I have that extra sweet craving for a drink I'm just up the street from here. :)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love #1. Super refreshing and the pandan jelly is yummy. It also has basil seeds  longan  and coconut slices. I've only been to two bambus  and I feel like the one in my area taste a little more refreshing and crisp.   The drinks come out pretty quickly but I wished this location would be opened later since it's Vegas.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,If you are looking for great  boba then this is perfect place for you. The staff is very welcoming and makes sure that what you order comes out just the way you want it. I definitely recommend this place if you are a boba lover. Oh and I recommend the passion fruit iced tea with strawberry jelly and boba. It's delicious !
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Pleasantly surprised! Super clean and nicely furnished inside unlike most china town places. Not sketchy at all! And they actually have a lot of seating inside even though they only sell primarily drinks.   Great customer service (:   Their dessert drinks remind me of my childhood because they taste exactly like what I have back at my hometown which is really amazing . I ordered number 10!   Most definitely coming back here!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I was there on July 4th last week. When I got there they said no bobas-I should have walked out then. I put in my order for 3 smoothies and 2 milk teas. They said no mangoes for the milk teas so I changed my order to 2 lychee milk teas. We had to wait a very long time n the couple in front of me had called their order n still had a long wait. It was ridiculous how long we all had to wait. So we take the drinks back to our hotel and the mango smoothies are tasteless! No mango taste at all. So I called and asked to speak to the manager  and he/she was not there  so I told them I would bring those 2 smoothies back and I went back and they gave me my money back- 2 stars instead of 1 star for that.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I'm writing this as I'm drinking my #10 with boba...  THIS DRINK IS AMAZING.   How did I not know this place was here?! This isn't too far from my house and it's a cute little spot in Chinatown. They have many options  they have options for everyone!   They have free wifi so I could definitely hang out here with some friends and have some drinks. I would totally study here if the music wasn't so loud! Turn down the music just a little please!   Otherwise everything is great. Staff are very clean and friendly.   LOVE THIS PLACE.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Yummyinourtummy  my hubby & our Babygirls loves this place very cozy & Desserts are Deelish  The staff are so Friendly & great customer service  Nina & Cindy I love I guys
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I have had Bambi in Los Angeles but since the Vegas one had a yelp deal when I was there I thought I would review. I order #1 and it was delicious. A must try and definitely a great Vietnamese drink fix worth the money especially when you are looking for a good after dinner drink on a hot day. I'm not a resident of Vegas but my family who are would agree that they seldom find a good Vietnamese/Chinese place to eat or get a drink.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This place should just close down if they don't care about customer service. There is a young asian girl who took our order (Her name is Khong based on my receipt) & seems like she is having a bad day & her attitude is TERRIBLE!! Why work there if you have an attitude like that. She is obviously young with no experience or maybe her mother owns it (cuz who the heck would hire her??!!) But being young & inexperienced is no excuse to act like a brat! The drinks itself is toooooo sweet & when asked to adjust it - MORE Attitude! I feel so unwelcome here. There are so many other tea places to go to. I recommend Tea Space right next to it. They have quality drinks without the attitude here at Bambu. They actually want you to be happy & welcome adjustments. I will never come back & i will never recommend this place to anyone! Stay away!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Even though they messed up my order a couple of times  I will always love their drinks!!!! Their boba is exceptionally delicious. I used to work at a boba joint in California and had always praised my old work's boba's quality but this good as well.   The only downfall is that I live all the way on the other side of town. So...... :(   Love love bambu desserts!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I'm debating between 3 and 4 stars for this place.  I'm glad it has the ordinary Vietnamese desserts that I love.  However  the quality has not been consistence.  I came 10 times during the last month and ordered almost everything on the desert drink menu.  Most drinks are make to order  but be aware that some ingredients are straight from the canned.  The restroom is clean and it plays mixed Vietnamese  U.S. hip-hop  rap and techno video music.  Overall  it is a decent place whenever you crave Vietnamese desserts and good Boba.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Great place to get your boba drink on.  I always order the avocado smoothie with boba mixed with it.  Highly recommend this place to anyone  just make sure to drive safe because it is a ways distance to get here.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Parking: small shared lot  I didn't have a problem finding parking but I can only imagine this place being packed and seeing cars circling around looking for a spot.  Service: the lady at the register (she also made my drink) was so friendly and nice! She saw my kandi and asked if I had gone to EDC. I liked that she tried to make small talk with me  if I had a tradeable  I would've definitely gave her one :P   Drink: I ordered #4. It was yummy! I kind of wish that all of my drink was cold when I got it though  maybe I just haven't had a Vietnamese desert drink in too long? I had my friend try it for the first time and he described it as a salad in a cup LOLOL.   Tips:  +_free wifi  their password is posted on the wall to they right of the register! +_you can add Boba free of charge to any order! +_the lounge couches are pretty worn in and  kind of sink in  so be careful!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,They're inexpensive and unique ! everything taste so fresh and delicious I've been coming here for about a year almost every month and it is worth every penny !!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Great service  good prices and seriously yum drinks! Don't let the tinted glass deter you  they are open til 11! My favorite place to get a sweet beverage and I bring all my friends and family here.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"You can add ingredients for no extra cost!  It's basically the ""Che"" Desserts that I go there for. They are brand new  so it's clean. The staff are very helpful when it comes to selecting a drink that you would enjoy. There are so many options.    If it weren't for the calories  I'd be here everyday.  Free wifi. K-Pop music videos played all day long.  Parking situation is a problem...so just park on the small street around the corner.  Located right next to Hot N Juicy and across the street from the Crown & Anchor Pub/Big Lots/Sieu Thi Thuan Phat/Pho So 1 Plaza."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love vietnamese desserts especially on a hot day in vegas. One of my favorite vietnamese dessert of all time is che ba may and i love the variety of desserts they have here. Its even better than the basic che ba mau. You can customize the dessert. For example I usually don't like chestnut topping min mine so i got number 4 which had everything i love to eat in my che. can't wait to go back! Its also a plus to add a scoop of ice cream!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Amazing little place. Very clean. Great selection of Vietnamese deserts.  The only place in town that serve Che. I love #11. Mung bean with banh lot. So yummy.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Now I can get Bambu even in Vegas!! Great clean location with awesome friendly staff. #6 is my go to when I want something sweet. It has the yummy jellies and I also get my fruit for the day. Double whammy :)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,If you're a dessert lover than this place is for you! Bamboo has a range of selections  from boba tea to special Vietnamese desserts.   My personal favorite is #4 which basically included mung bean  pandon and grass jelly  coconut milk and red bean. This delicious concoction is quite yummy with the shaved ice that was added.   I basically tried almost all the dessert and they're all very yummy so it's really up to the individual what they like in their CHE ( Vietnamese Dessert ).   If you need a caffeine fix  order the cafe sua da ( Coffee with milk ). All desserts are from $4-$5 so it's a great deal.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Very pleased with my experience I wasn't sure what to order and the girl taking my order suggested a few things.Very nice and friendly and service was fast as well.Will be visiting frequently!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I always go to the one in Westminster. Now that I moved to Vegas  I went to the Vegas location. I ordered my usual #1. I looked at my drink and I realized the jelly was yellow instead of green. I ask the girl why is the jelly yellow because the jelly should be green. She told me its green and held a yellow notepad next to it to compare. I thought I was color blind for the first time in my life and ask my cousin that was with me. He laugh and said its yellow and the girl was still trying to convince both of us that it is green. She finally said let me talk to the people that made it. At that point we were over it but the worse part is the drink tasted Nasty!!!!! Never going back!!!!!!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Truly a ""sui generis"" experience. After dozens upon dozens of visits  I am ready to give some perspective on this unique Vietnamese offering.  Locale-  Nestled in a competitive boba/dessert market known as Spring Mountain Rd.  BAMBU is strategically adjacent to Hot N Juicy Crawfish for a one-two punch spicy-then-sweet experience if so desired.   When you walk through the door  you will see a simple but clean layout. There are couches to allay any fears of those who loathe uncomfortable seats. A few provided games like Connect Four can be played to pass the time. They have fast  free wifi-- a large concern for some people and not always a commodity (especially the fast part)!  Ambient music includes a variety of korean/kpop  vietnamese  and billboard 100 songs. These songs are usually synced with the music videos on the large TV screen near the aforementioned couches. Customers can be a bit loud sometimes during busy hours (bring headphones).  Desserts/Drinks-  As a franchise with 40+ locations  one would have moderately high expectations for BAMBU. After having been to at least 3 stores across multiple states  I can safely say that the products themselves are fairly uniform. That said  the special Vietnamese desserts ""Che"" each offer unique combinations of -pandan jelly (green thin  gummyworm-like strips)  -grass jelly (darker  jello-like)  -red bean  -coconut milk  -taro  and more.  Tastewise  if you are new to ""Che"" you may start with #1 BAMBU Special and if you like it  move from there into the other dessert menu items. They all take from the same base ingredients and add/remove what you specifically may like/dislike until you get something you will love. BAMBU also offers more traditional Taiwanese Milk Tea  Coffee drinks  and Smoothies. *Special tip- their vanilla ice cream is surprisingly very good!  Price- You get great value for your money. Getting a reg. dessert w/ 4 unique ingredients for $4.50 vs the same price for one-flavored tea w/ boba at most other places. Do the math!  Service-  Every place will have mixed customer experiences no matter how well-trained staff are. As the vast majority of the other reviews attest  BAMBU does have higher calibre service in terms of friendliness and helpfulness. They are not hesitant to give recommendations and help you scratch your niche.  TLDR;- Ambience- 4/5 (loud customers during busy times  bring headphones) Desserts/Drink- 5/5 (try them all!) Service- 5/5 (friendly  helpful) Overall- 4.7/5 (Succulent!)"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is my favorite boba place. Parking is kinda a pain sometimes.  The girls are friendly and cute.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I stop by more than I probably should lol. My mom had the Thai tea last time we came and it was pretty good... I think it could have been a little sweeter  but still good. I personally come for the desserts which are always spot on even though I'm still not 100% sure what all of the ingredients are  but they taste really good so that's okay.   Stop by if you have a chance or if you happen to head over to Chinatown!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I saw this dessert place when I was grubbing my noodle at Pho So 1 across the street. I had try their Che at Westminster's store and it was ok  but since I'm really craving something sweet and refreshing after my meal so I decided to try them again  the store was clean and the staff was very friendly  Thuy the cashier recommend #1 the bambu special  and it was so good  it came with basil seed  longan  pieces of young coconut and pandan jelly in coconut water. So glad I pick up a good drink for my long drive back to LA
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"This place is clever- their ""secret menu"" board is just to the left of the cashier  right in plain sight. There  you can find amazing things.   I'm referring specifically to their Blended Vietnamese coffee drink- it's like coffee-flavored crack in a cup  blended like a dessert. It's so deliciously intoxicating  that I'd be hard-pressed to turn down a proposal if it were accompanied by one of these drinks. Take notes  suitors!  Interior is pleasant with KPOP music videos playing  service is upbeat and friendly  wifi is free  and upgrading your drink to a large is just $1 more- what more could you want?!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Love this place! One of my favorite spot in Las Vegas. I'm a huge fan of desserts so I come here very often. I either order the large size of Vietnamese che desserts  boba drinks  or smoothies and I'm always satisfied.  The customer service is great. They are always welcoming  attentive  and nice. I enjoy the setup of the place. Everything from the beautiful tiles  cool comfortable couches  and my very favorite cute decor of the shop. Its a nice place to enjoy my desserts and hangout.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I've been here a couple time and I usually get the same thing. I believe it's the number 4. It has beans and taro and pandan jelly with coconut milk. It can be a bit on the sweeter side but it's a nice little dessert drink.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I am not a huge fan of che  I usually come here for the smoothies not really for Che but since my mom love it  so we come here often. The place is cute and have some good products. The only reason I knocked 2 stars from the rating is due to the place's efficiency. The first 4 times I came here it took me 15 minute for 1 cups of Che and a smoothie. I don't mind the wait  but other people might. I didn't plan to come here anymore until my god mother said that they have gotten better with it so I came back tonight and it's the same thing ! 15 minutes for a cup of Che and a smoothie. Like i said I don't mind waiting for it  but I don't think it's worth 15 minutes for. There are other places to get smoothies and Che. I'm not saying that I will never come back  but I won't be coming back as often as I would like to.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I asked what was in their green tea drink and she couldn't tell me.   How can you work some where and not know what's in your drinks  I could be allergic to something.  I went ahead and ordered it anyways  despite my better judgment  it was way to sweet and tasted more like fatty milk and in melted sugar than green tea  it was disgusting.   I will never go back here again!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We were disappointed by the service here. We ordered our drinks and then after we paid she told us there was no boba left. How do you not have boba available?! Anyways  the service wasn't very good and boba is what makes the drinks. It was fine but not what was expected.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,So if you're not comfortable with trying the Vietnamese desserts (which are amazing) you can come here for your typical boba smoothies. I like to order the number 4 dessert and number 6  wifey gets the number 1 which is good too..the reason why we love it here because it's like eating Thai or Laos desserts.  if you like sweet coconut milk give the desserts a try if you don't like it the boba is good too
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,#6 is the bomb! I come here a few times a month.... Prices are good. Check-in for 1.00$ off. Lots of good selections.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Great flavored milk tea!  Their boba was really tasty also.  The only downside was the wait: we were there on a Saturday and it was empty  yet somehow it still took them about 15 minutes to make our 2 drinks.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I kept hearing good things about this place and when I finally tried it  I was happy I did.   Just like many of the reviews I tried #6 and was not disappointed!   *Unlike many of the other tea places on spring mountain this one closes early (10pm or 11pm)*
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,This is a drink spot. I just recently got into this boba thing about a year or so ago and this is one of those spots. But it does separate itself from the others for their desert drinks and they put the favorites on the wall as well as their secret menu.   Their slushes were ok but I think desert drinks are what they are known for anyway. They are sweet so if ure in the mood for that  try this place out. Also  if ure Filipino  #2 and #3 taste like halo halo.  Also the Vietnamese coffee with no sugar is mad concentrated and will keep u laced up all night.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Bambu has now become a huge chain and I'm glad to see one in Vegas.    CHECK IN ON YELP for a free upgrade in size.  The place is small and cozy.  Not too many seats but its never too crowded either.  Came with friends after dinner at Hot and Juicy which is right next door.  Needed something sweet to wipe that garlicky goodness from my palate.    I know the three bean drink is everyone's go to but I don't like the texture of bean.  I love all the jellys they put in che (Vietnamese word for dessert) so I ordered #6 which had a ton of jellies  jackfruit lychee and young coconut I believe.  I think one order  especially a large  is enough to share for two people.  I really liked my dessert.  A little sweet but I loved all the chewy jellies and they do give you a lot of it.  A little stingy on the coconut meat.  Its also a little hard on the go because you need to open the lid and eat it with a spoon.  My friend got the three bean drink.  I tried it and I really liked it!!  The bean was super smooth and not gritty at all like the other places i've tried.  It was sweet  smooth  thick and went perfectly with the coconut milk.  SUch a surprise!  I might even order it next time.  Will definitely come back if I'm craving some Vietnamese desserts.  They have so many combos! I will order a different one next time.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love that there's a Bambu Dessert here in Vegas. I literally come here almost everyday and I can't get enough of it!! Everything here is just so good! They have a wide selection of desserts  milk teas  smoothies made out of REAL fruit  iced coffee and frappucinos.   In the corner of the store  they have this little comfy white couch area to hangout with friends and they provide cards and board games underneath the table. Its nicely decorated. They're always playing KPOP or american music videos on the tv. There's also free wifi here so it's the perfect place to study.   I've never been a big fan of boba but Bambu makes it perfect it here. Its has this malty flavor that I can't really explain and it's the right amount of chewy. The desserts are light and sweet. # 1 and 10 are my favorite. Recently they added a option where you can add ICE CREAM to your dessert or milk tea for $.75! I love adding vanilla ice cream and boba to my taro milk tea  They have great customer service. The moment I walk in  they greet me with a smile  chat me up and remember my name. They're so friendly and attentive to my every dessert/boba need.   Parking can be a pain at times when it gets busy. They're located right next to Hot n' Juicy so that's a plus.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,price went up  quality went down and quantity is less . the fruits are not even fresh.    It was good when first open now it's not that good .
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The smoothies and milk tea here are really good  but majority of the time  me and my mom's orders aren't right. Even when they ask twice to make sure  or when we let them know it isn't what we asked for  there's no improvement for their service.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Service 1/5 Food or Drink 4/5 Cleanliness 4/5  The place is clean and very good looking. However  I've been here 3 times  and the service is pretty slow. They're probably understaffed  since I only see 1 guy working in the back and 1 in the front. The drinks that they present and advertise for are good! I don't usually don't like che or Asian desserts  but I do like Bambu! I recommend it if you're into these kinds of drink desserts. No Cake or Cookies here !
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Love the #5 here the drink is really good... But sometimes they will run out of it and it sucks hihi... I only tried 2 drinks here so far but the other on I didn't like it has coconut and red bean something... Only gave 4 stars just because sometimes the will run out of my favorite for couple of days... I know lame lol... And sometimes service is really slow just because they only have like 2-3 people this place could really get busy tha place is really nice and a nice place to chill... But parking will suck though if the compound is busy... People are really friendly
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I'm here at least once a week. I love the deserts and especially love the taro and durian. I like how they use real fruits. Julie was was accommodating and very well informed about what I should put in my desert. Deffinitely a go-to for boba.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The first Bambu store I tried was in San Mateo  California. Since I liked that one so much  I was excited to find out there was a Bambu in Las Vegas which just opened.   Conveniently  we had just finished dinner at Hot and Juicy so why not top the night off with a dessert drink.   I order the #10  which consists of coconut milk  red tapioca  pandan jelly  and grass jelly. The drink was good all except for the lack of coconut milk. It is true  after you mix everything together  the mixture becomes a watered-down skim-milk beverage. If I had never had the same drink in San Mateo  then I would have never noticed the difference in consistency and flavor. I hope they step up their standards and put in more coconut milk and/or less ice.   I would probably go back once every full moon  because I don't know of any places that serve these types of drinks in Las Vegas. If you do  send me a message!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We've been coming here since it first opened.  Che galore!  My favorite is a #6 tweaked with a few different ingredients.  They are always happy to make my drink the way I want.    I see that they have an extensive of desserts   coffees  teas   smoothies.... ect. I'm excited to try everything.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Not many places where you'll find good Che (vietnamese desserts). This place is on point with all the Che your parents and grandparents use to make. It's got many different varieties to suit your pallette for that visit.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We order bambu special  # 10 very disappointed I am alway a fan of bambu but this time everything wasn't cook properly and too much ice tasted very bland.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I went  here a couple days ago an hour or so before they closed. They were out of boba  so I left and decided to come back the next day. They did have boba the next day!   The parking lot is kind of small  and since there are other businesses around it would be hard to find a place to park if it's busy! The inside is very nice  perfect for a dessert shop like this one. They had Connect 4 in the seating area. (Of course we played.) They have a sign that says if you check in on Yelp or Facebook you get to upsize for free! (Of course we did that also.) My boyfriend got a #10 special  which he really liked. I got a Thai Tea Smoothie with Boba.  Overall I really enjoyed my experience there!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,I love bambu desserts. My favorite ones are #6 and #2. My friend got me into this in San Jose California and when I came back to Vegas  I found this place in China town. I can't stop coming here :-)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Ermygerd!!! I absolutely love this place!! My college roommate used to make these desserts and when I moved away  I thought ""that's it. That's the end of the Vietnamese dessert for me."" But this place opened and I absolutely love all the small intricate parts to the dessert! I'm lactose intolerant and my boyfriend doesn't appreciate when I eat these  but I sure enjoy them. Basically anything w the red tapioca balls with the little crunch in the middle and jelly noodles in there  that's my favorite. I can't wait to go back!! Oh  parking stinks though. Lol but so good!!"
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,We are loyal customers to Bambu back in Seattle  WA so when we found one here in LV we were more than excited.   As we got our order  we quickly realized that they had given us the wrong drinks. We told one of the employees that it was wrong and she rudely told us that this is what we ordered. This happened for 2 out of our 4 drinks. (We ordered a number 13 and 14 and got a number 3 and 4) So this could have not been our wrong doing but the fault of who took our order because we always order the same drinks. At any other place they would have redone our drinks without question.   I would have given this place more stars if the customer service was better and the food was more fresh.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,The worse avocado smoothly ever.  It doesn't taste avocado  I don't know what they mix but I drink this almost every day but today i stop by this Bambu dessert ( I'm from San Francisco) it is the worse dessert.  I'm craving for avocado and it Tastes so bad.:( and my husband has Che Ba Mau  it is also bad.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Bambu boba has more unique flavors than your ad average place.  My boyfriend said his taro boba was better than our usual place.  They have fresh taro but the large size was smaller than what we're used to and the boba is smaller too.  I had the sapota boba which tastes like a malty fruity beer.  The desserts are really interesting and kind of healthy.  We shared the bambu special which had fresh coconut   basil seeds (kind of like Chia seeds)  pandan jelly and lychees. Super yummy.  :)
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Ppl always go here and say it's good  but I've gone twice here in CA and in Las Vegas.  Had bad experience for both. Only difference was Vegas service was so much better with the staff. First time my friends and I went one of the drinks was suppose to have crushed ice  where you stir it and it mixes into drink  but instead it was just a clump of ice. We asked for ice or another cup and the lady just look at us as though she about to knock us out. Horrible service  we waited long with an unfriendly welcome. Vegas  service was great with friendly staff  but again the drinks were eh  so so. Maybe just my luck but I don't think I'll be back.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Tried the #6 and the #10  both were great.  Love Bambu!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,"Very good! Nice and warm welcome by friendly and pretty girl.  Drinks tasted great.  Priced fair.  Quality fresh.  Vast selections.  Too bad the spot was right next to a sleazy looking massage parlor and another shop squishing this place in between and felt the outside is kind of dirty.  Must be because lack of a patio or even a ""sidewalk.""  Will definitely go back.  Maybe try their snacks."
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Yes yes YES!!! I was ecstatic when I saw this as I've been craving it from LA! So refreshing  and a great way to rehydrate from the dry weather! The lady was a bit confused with my order  and she seemed a bit brusque/borderline rude about it  but eventually we got it right.  I got a large coconut juice with pandan jelly and taro (I wanna say I got one more topping but can't remember). I expected the taro to be chunks of taro  but it was actually a sweet paste...wasn't super taro-y  but ah well. The pandan jelly was also decent.   I think the best location for me is still in Rowland Heights back in Cali  but hey  can't be choosy when you're in another state right? Definitely will be stopping by again!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,As many says here as well....I LOVE this place! The coconut milk they use is very fresh  light and not too overwhelming. What I also love most about this place compared to  other Vietnamese dessert places is how I can modify it to pretty much whatever I want without major up-charges. I always get my #10 (red tapioca  grass and pandan jelly and ADD longan and basil seeds).  I can choose to not add additional sweetener into it as the other ingredients naturally are cooked in a little sweetener already. So its perfectly and lightly sweetened even if you don't add any more to it.  Parking:  This place can be hard to find as its in a corner of a street next to Hot & Juicy Crawfish which I LOVE to go to as well. It parking is VERY small but since there isn't much people to knows about the place or normally come to this location  I never had trouble finding a space.  Price:  A little costly compared to other Vietnamese dessert places but I don't mind paying that little extra for what I get. Its yummy and refreshing on a really hot day!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Found this place on yelp. Really cool place to chill and relax. They have a good variety on their menu. If you show them you checked into the Yelp app they'll take off $1 and upgrade your drink to a large. I Definitely would come back!
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Tui was awesome ^^ she made me an amazing jackfruit smoothie. I couldn't find jackfruit anywhere except here
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,Overpriced coffee without the free upgrade at checkin --- and the staff made everyone in my party feel uncomfortable. We drank our drinks outside.
Juice Bars & Smoothies;Coffee & Tea;Bubble Tea;Food;Desserts,If ur into Asian desserts this is the place to go...  Its nice to taste some of the drinks and desserts I grew up with when I was a kid
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,"Another great spot to cool down during these sweltering summer months! Agua el Manantial has two convenient locations for all your water-related needs: this store in the Twin Lakes Plaza at Rancho and Washington  and another in the plaza behind Tacos el Gordo on E Charleston. The first detail I noticed was how clean this place is inside. There are large reverse osmosis tanks behind the counter and blue walls that make the place feel very calm. For being a water store/Mexican candy shop/ice cream and snack bar  it's fortunately missing that dirt factor that I've encountered at similar businesses.   If you're needing alkaline or regular purified water  you can get that here. A blue sign above the door advertises ""RASPADOS Y BIONICOS"" and I've tried both. I appreciated the tart tamarind syrup on the raspado  but the snow cone was hard to eat with several very large ice chunks in the styrofoam cup. I love shaved ice but this is just crushed ice. The bionicos (sweet fruit salad) was a huge portion of fresh papaya  cantaloupe  strawberries  and banana covered in sweet cream and topped with granola  raisins  and coconut.   They also offer fresh juices  traditional aguas frescas in various flavors including alfalfa  a few brands of paletas  and Dreyer's ice cream. The shelves are lined with candies that one would find in Mexico and there's some unique selections in the mix  including lollipops in the shape of pollo a la brasa but they don't taste like chicken. They even sell pinatas  so you know what to do with all that candy."
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,I love the Raspados made with fresh fruit  I had the liquido de papaya absolutely Delicious and so many delicious Snacks
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Best place in town  they serve a lot of yummy treats if your looking for sweet spicy or sour they have it. They also have a juice bar with a wide variety of healthy juices
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,This place is so good! They have a selection for everything! I tried the horchata frap and it was yummy! I'll be back to try more!
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,You know those yummy pictures everyone posts on Instagram or Facebook that make your mouth water and give you slight envy because you question where the hell they got that from? (& you slightly assume it's in LA or Mexico) and even though you don't have the slightest clue what it is you still want it? Well look no further this is where you find all of those delicious treats that will blast you off to tropical heaven. This location is very clean and authentic! The location is shady but have no fear  the options available are amazing and totally worth the drive! I got the manzana loca which was just what I needed for this hot weather  oh so yummy!
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,I would give this place 5 stars but.... When I said chocolate ice cream 2 times for one of my kids I still received 2 cookies and cream so I corrected him and told him one was chocolate and he refused to take it back. So my son never ate the cookies and cream :/ spent $30 here would have thought he would have been generous enough to just give me 1 scoop of chocolate... But other then that really clean and good kinda wish my fruit had more tajin but really yummy place !
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Went 8-28-15 around 2:20 PM.  This store is located in a shopping center on the northeast corner of the intersection of Rancho and Washington.  My friend Maria was craving this thing called a Chamango and it had me intrigued so I yelped it and found this place.   When I pulled into the shopping center I almost turned around and left cuz' this is a sketchy area  folks.  All the shops have bars on the windows and doors & plenty of unsavory characters hanging around.    I pulled in and went inside  a bit nervous because I'm such a white girl.  The inside is surprisingly extremely clean and organized  and much larger than I thought from the outside.  Like yelper Mari L. said  they have just about every Mexican goody you could ever want.  Popsicles  smoothies  juices  slushies  ice cream  candies  nachos  weird cucumber things  you name it! Also they have water bottle filling stations there.  In the back behind the counter there are huge tanks of water and what seems to be a water filtering apparatus.    The ladies working there were incredibly nice and patient with my gringa questions.  $16.50 got me three Chamangos.  Okay  so  a chamango is basically like a mango slushy with real fresh mangoes in it  and a mexican hot sauce called chamoy.  I asked for no chamoy since I wasn't sure what it tasted like.  I think the best part is it comes with this straw with chile/tamarind chewy candy wrapped around it.  You have a little slushy  then nibble on the straw and the combination is amazing.  Loved it.  I'll be back.
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Yummy this is a great Mexican shop with all the Mexican goodies you can think of. Not too crowded and very clean. They have dryers ice cream a little bit expensive but  definitely a must try.
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,I seriously crave chamango everyday! *huge tip* If you order the chamango  ask to add ice cream. It's about $2.50 more but it's creamier and soooo tasty! I love this place!
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Always feels great coming here!! If u have a sweet tooth and like chamoy and tajin I definitely recommend this place. Every time we are in town we make sure to come here for some gummies with chamoy.
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Really cool place that has different fruit cocktails  ice creams  and mexican candy. Prices are very reasonable!!
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,The inly reason why I am giving this place a 3 stars is cause I had two problems. When I think aboit chamango I think about the lime and the mango coming together to create a fantastic flavor. However this place doesn't believe in adding lime only sugar syrup my chamango was so sweet I left not feeling that satisfied. I went to my local store and just mafe myself lime with cucumber with Tajin. Second problem was that I came here with a friend. Of course chamango has mangos but when my frined came 4 mins after me and ordered a mango with lime salad they told her they had no more. So she got something else. We decided to eat out food there when a group of people came in and ordered a chamango and yup you guessed it. They had mangos. Yea. My friend and I felt so unwelcomes here. Don't know if I would want to come back. But that was just my  experience.
Shaved Ice;Food;Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt;Juice Bars & Smoothies,Very nice and clean place.  Very close to my work place.  Great for when you have those sweet or savory cravings.  There raspados  ( shaved ice) are really good   they have all kinds of flavors. Will definitely come back.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),No service at this location. Tried to roll thru the drive thru  after a few minutes of silence at the menu board I rolled to thw window. Three employees standing around doing nothing. Two looked at me and turned around so I left. Avoid this location.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This is a new location. All of the new locations in Las Vegas do not have the traditional 2 piece special on Tuesdays. But  this store was very clean. The food was very fresh and my order came up in less than 5 minutes.  The customer service was excellent.  The staff is friendly and patient  (the person I came with takes a moment to order).
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This is the worst Popeyes I have ever been to. Their biscuits are hard and relatively tasteless compared to the fluffy and buttery Popeyes biscuit to which I have become accustomed. It doesn't even taste like they are using the Popeyes recipe. The staff is not well-trained and is not polite. The chicken doesn't taste quite like Popeyes chicken. I have tried this location three times since it first opened  hoping the overall experience with improved. Three strikes and you are out! No more
Restaurants;American (Traditional),"Went to this place for the ""Tuesday special"" that Popeyes advertises. And this place said they don't do the Tuesday specials. So they had a new special for $4 wicked good deal and they said they didn't have the chicken for that special. So.... I ordered a #2 with Cajun rice. When I got my order  the side rice was only filled halfway. ?!!  They also were out of napkins. I'm surprised this place even has chicken at this point. The guy that took my order was ok but everything else in this visit was unacceptable. This is why I'm never coming to this location ever again. This kind of stuff makes a bad name for the Popeyes franchises."
Restaurants;American (Traditional),I was excited to see that they are going to open a new Popeyes but it only takes one time to ruin me from going back there ever. The reason I gave them a one star is because they have their own way of running their store. I asked if they have the TUESDAY SPECIAL and they said they don't  so I asked why not and they basically told me they just don't. I told them that if they were on the strip of Vegas I would understand that  because most most places they wouldn't have the special but they are off the strip.   If you want to get the TUESDAY SPECIAL go to the one between Maryland Pkwy and Tropicana Ave. That Popeyes at least understand how to run their store and how it's suppose to be by the book and the rules.   Even though that other Popeyes is very busy they have good customer service not like this new place I drove by next to 99 cent store and will never go to that one.   This Popeyes I bet don't even care. With this type of reviews his business location will not survive. Not so good luck to you so far.  I'm gonna make sure everyone in my twitters and Facebook peps will be notified.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This location has slow service. I noticed a worker was prepping about 5 orders BEFORE calling out the numbers. Instead she should've called out EACH order as they were completed. Long unnecessary waiting. NOT GOING THERE AGAIN!!!
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This place has terrible service. They constantly mess up orders and don't acknowledge customers that walk in. I waited for ten minutes before walking out of the place. They have employees walking around the store on break and managers casually walking inside but no service to even take my order let alone make it. Just before I walked out I heard the cashier who didn't ring me up tell another customer that they were out of fries. This place blows. My view of this Popeye's has massively decreased and I don't recommend anyone go here. Go to Canes just around the corner and buy from employees that care to give semi-good service.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),Great service and great chicken. The biscuits and Cajun rice are always my fav. The restaurant and the service is not bad.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),Been in the drive through for 20 min with just 2 cars in front of me. Didn't even want what I ordered anymore. Just drove past the window
Restaurants;American (Traditional),Don't expect this crappy location to have honey in stock. If they do  the employees are too lazy to look for it when you ask anyway.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This location does not participate in the Tuesday deal of $1.49 leg and thigh. But the one on Maryland and Tropicana does.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),Never went into popeyes at this location   I've only stopped to get gas until last night. Great young lady at the cashier counter  very helpful not only to me but when a customer had to come back and return a messed up order she didn't question the lady she just fixed the problem and it only took 2 seconds to do so. The lady was happy and the cashier always had a smile on her face. Super polite and patient cashier  I give her a 5 star for handling customers with awesome customer service skills. Plus  she was quick with my order and she knew that I was in a hurry. 5 stars!!!
Restaurants;American (Traditional),This is the WORST place I've ever been too in my life. I've given them 3 chances to earn my business and the 1st time I went they didn't have sauce and my food was cold! 2nd time the didn't have sauce again and had the audacity to get an attitude with me because I didn't want the food. And the 3rd time I went I sat in the drive thru waiting to place my order  no one ever answered so I drove up to the window and no one still helped me. I have never hated a place so much.
Restaurants;American (Traditional),Bad service. They were backed up on orders when i came in and the lobby wasn't even full. Had 3-4 employees just standing in there. Lobby and restrooms looked like they hadn't been cleaned all day. With the amount of staff youd think one of them could check on the cleanliness of their establishment. Out of sauce and out of sweet tea. You'll probably get better service with another location.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Having gone to the horrible Double Down based on Yelp reviews that could not have been more wrong (wtf are you people smoking) I was walking back in the direction of my hotel and noticed Office Bar and thought I'd give it a shot.   It was great. It's divey with no apologies and everyone was very friendly. I watched the entire Thursday night game and came out with an $18 tab. Awesome. Cory the bartender even bought pizza for the bar from the place next door which was not only kind of him but the pizza was amazing. I will be back!
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Best Dive Bar in Vegas!!!  Always my first stop when I get to town!!  The bartender Corey kicks ass!!! $$$
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,If you like a strong drink  stop by The Office Bar. No button pushing pouring like you'll find at most of the stuffy casinos on the Strip and It's nestled comfortably in the Gay bar district. Located smack dab in the middle of  Double Down Saloon and Hard Rock Cafe and Hotel  It's great to enjoy a reasonably priced drink that'll knock your Aunt Connie's socks off  before you head off to people watch. Pool  darts  an online jukebox that you can program to not suck  and fun to be had is what truly the Office Bar 1 is all about. Start there or wind up there  either way you'll have a great time gettin' loaded!
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,"Was staying nearby at an Airbnb & discovered this ""dive"" bar & so happy we did. Local flair with great people  drinks  & liquors to buy. It was a great price for the quality of beers that are on tap...think micro/craft beers without the ""Vegas"" price tag. We will return for sure on our next visit."
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Great beer. Great people. Affordable.   Came into town for a business trip as well as some pleasure afterwards. My girlfriend's colleague suggested this place if you want GREAT beer at an affordable price -- while also getting away from the strip. Her coworker did not let us down. Cory (the owner) is an awesome guy  and the patrons in the bar were also very friendly. We ended up making a connection for dinner at the bar  which made our trip even better. They also own a liquor store which made it easy to grab a bottle and bring back to our hotel.  Highly suggest for those who don't want to be on the strip or for those who want a break from the strip.  Thanks again  Cory!
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,You know you haven't truly lived until you've taken a cab from the airport and  while on route to the Bellagio  you ask the driver to stop somewhere so you can buy a 1.75 Liter of Stoli.   So he stops at the Office Bar and  sure enough  you can score booze by the bottle and they even sell ice  diet sprite  and they'll throw in some plastic cups.  And you truly haven't lived if you experience all this because  as you were waiting patiently in seat 34-A for your flight to take you home to Oakland  you got kicked off the flight because some of your friends were too fucking drunk to fly!!  Oh  and of course  it's these same friends that requested that we stop for the booze...  I swear somebody was channeling Hunter S. Thompson this weekend.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Chill place.  Table top poker at a regular ole bar...accept for the fact you can buy booze in the back to go!  Its pretty classy looking too.  I like it.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Hands down one of the best places we visited in Vegas. Sure  appears to be a dive bar but with great people  drinks  and food it's beyond a great experience.   The service was great with an amazing bartender who made perfect drinks. The owner joined us later and was charming and hilarious.   Drinks were inexpensive and worth every penny. With the perfect amount of alcohol in them  ensuring a great time.   This bar is a refreshing break from the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,I like going there for darts sometimes... but the music when I went in last week was atrocious... gangster rap with about 10 white people and nobody was into it... I guess I'll go visit it again in another 7 years or so... or whenever I really wanna play darts and I happen to be across the street at double down.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,The Miller High Life is cheap.  Dead the night I went  so I didn't stay long enough to get to know the bartenders or anybody there.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,"I end up in Vegas fairly often (at least 3x a month) for business  and can't stand to forgo a visit to the Office Bar. ALL of the bartenders I've met are awesome  though Victor tends to be working when my schedule allows me to venture out  and he represents well. The beer on tap is awesome...if you drink beer  you'll find what you're looking for. From Stone (a variety  too)  to local brews  to your basics  this is THE spot to come for a casual  real  local-bar vibe with great drinks and conversation. Dark and divey? Yes. Smoking allowed  yes  so just like back in the day when your clothes and hair smelled like smoke the morning after (get over it). Music  yup. Pool. Indeed. Booze for purchase (bottles) and pizza next door  of course. Open 24-hrs? You bet! It's a great ""away from the strip"" and ""local-bar"" experience. LOVE coming here! Thanks to all those who make it a cool place to just relax."
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,This is not the kind of place I would frequent on the norm  HOWEVER  I am a local and have local friends that LOVE this place. Because of the great memories I have accrued form this bar  I give it 4 stars. If you wander in  you will always leave smelling of cigarettes and never of shame. The people who visit this bar are typically locals who all know eachother. The jukebox plays every song known to man. And the bartender  Vic  always puts a smile on my face. Funny guy. It is pretty easy to get HAMMERED as the drink prices are relatively low. There are a lot of gay bars close by so in the wee hours of the night/morning  you get the drunk gays who wander in and always guarantee a great time.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Not to impressed with this place. Its a run down bar and the only reason why I was here. Because of naked pizza. Stock isn't that great  had four out of five taps empty. Half of their slots on the bar wasn't working. Service is good and very nice. Hope naked pizzas business won't get hurt because if this place?
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Great location in between Unlv campus & the strip. We came by this place on a Saturday night. We decided to stop in for some drinks before heading across the street to pirahna. This place is definitely a dive bar. It was dimly lit with a couple of pool tables  juke box and seats along the long bar. There were also a few tables. There was only one bartender for the entire place. We really had to work to get his attention at times. The mixed Drinks were pretty cheap but the bartender held back on the alcohol. My friends ordered food (the restaurant next door makes it and hands it to the bartender). Overall we had a good time  the atmosphere was chill and everyone was pretty friendly. I'm giving it three stars due to the slow service at the bar but other than that I recommend stopping by and getting some drinks before getting the rest of the night started.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,This place has great food connected to it but 1/2 of the machines were down. This place has a buy 1 get 1 free special. They sell bottles as well  like a liquor store. Pretty cool if you are in the neighborhood.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,"I visited Las Vegas last December and stopped by this bar because it was close to the Hard Rock casino where we were staying.  I am Gay and I went to Office Bar with my boyfriend.  While we were playing pool the bartender came over to us and stated  ""I can tell you two are Gay.  You need to leave.  This is not a bar for you people.""  We left  mostly because that's never happened to us and we had no idea how to respond.  This incident has been bothering me for weeks  so now I am going to start doing something about it  and this post begins it.  If management is reading this  you will be receiving a letter with my contact information in it along with copies of letters I am sending out to people who hopefully will be concerned that your bar does not do business with Gay people."
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,Wow Surprisedly an amazing craft beer selection! Craft beer brewery selections from New York to San Diego!  This place actually has the best draft beer on tap!
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,If you wanna real locals bar this place felt like it for sure.  I loved the fact that it's just an office space that's been converted into a bar complete with pool tables  darts  and you can even purchase liquor to go!  Nice low key vibe when you wanna get away from all the blingy goodness!
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,"Dive bar. Through and through.   Pool table  dimly lighted  sports on the TVs  smoke-filled  near the airport. Zero ""bro vibe"". Anton Chigurh would have a drink here.   A great selection of bottles and on tap. Dogfish Head  Brooklyn Lager  and of course fireball shots. There's even a pass-thru window so you can order food from the pizza shop next door (the pie is really  really good).   Bartender Cory was great. I'd be a regular if I lived nearby."
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,A bar you can truly call home.... I have so many good memories of this place. A group of regular locals and bartenders who become family. Best spot in Vegas.
Beer;Wine & Spirits;Food;Nightlife;Bars,(Please note that I now understand why the Yelp iPhone app does not let you post reviews from your phone...it's because you end up with ones like this one.  However  the more sober and less sleep deprived version of me cannot bring myself to change anything below as it was drafted on the spot with friends and I am incredibly proud and would like to document my awesome spelling skills while out late at night.  I would like to add though that our group of 4 was able to purchase each round at Office Bar 1 for the price of one drink on the strip  which pretty much made up for the cost of the cab fair in one round.)  Gambling is all fun and good and crucial to the economy of Nevada (according to the bartenders)  BUT if you you want to have real fun at a real bar  you must take the time and cab fair to hit up this bar. Visited and recommended by Vegas locals  this bar is just like the dives that I'd visit in Chicago. Real  comfortable  friendly staff  great place to hang out with friends and play a game of pool  feels like home...everything the strip is missing. And Colby is awesome.
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,I love this store! I get all of my favorite products in one place and at great prices! And all the girls are very nice and helpful if its your first time going it might be kind of tricky getting there  google maps takes you to a residency Other than that i love going there! And you do need a license to shop in there
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,This store is for professionals only. NO license  no service. So  having my Cosmetology license I get to reap the benefits of the fantastic prices. They have a great selection of color brands  waxing products  styling tools  nail products  even a salon furniture catalog. I frequent it often  whether it's this location or the one off of Flamingo  for my hair color and Hemp lotion. My boo even likes to check out the male products when I drag him along. The staff are always friendly and super helpful. Whether it's finding a specific product or a technical question they do what they can to help.   The first time I tried to find this location was a bit of a disaster. If you don't know where it is you will miss it. It is in the tiny shopping center in between the VA hospital and Ride Now power sports. If you are coming down Rancho from Craig Rd  you will have to go past and flip a U turn. There is always parking available  especially up close.   This is a great store for licensed professionals!
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,Very nice  clean  organized   and empty! I love not having to wait in line! Person up front was kind of old and grouchy other than that found everything I needed .
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,The girls that work at this location are seriously the sweetest ever. So full of knowledge and sooo helpful and willing to help. I honestly only come to this location because of how great the customer service is.
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,I used to love this location until they hired a shift managerthat makes me feel very uncomfortable. She is always trying to upsell by making the customers think they are not knowledgeable and they need her help.  I'm a licensed hairstylist And work with hair daily...not just selling the product! She is like a ninja  she follows you around the store and makes me feel unwelcome. Other than her I love their products  the store is organized and clean  and lots of parking...last but not least they are open 7 days a week.  Just one employee makes it dreadful for me to step foot in that place!
Shopping;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetics & Beauty Supply,I live way in north Las Vegas and drive to this cosmoprof simply because there are none near me. I honestly don't mind it now because the women in this store (except once) are always extremely sweet and attentive.    I love that they carry Pravana and the nail polish selection is every girls heaven!   Like the other Yelper stated  CosmoProf is  LICENSED estheticians  cosmetologists  and nail technicians only. This store is not open to the public!
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,This place is awesome. I was hit driving on the 15 one afternoon and sent here for repairs and to get a rental. Jason Wagner (their AAA guy) was sooo helpful. He kept me updated and I had my car back in just a few days. Not only was it repaired from the damage but the scratches that I had caused a few months prior were fixed! So happy with Jason  AAA  and the location that repaired my car (collision King centennial).
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Great rates... Good discounts... Good customer service...
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,I only dealt with a real person during my time with Hertz for about 5 mins. The rest of the time was online when made the reservation. The car was the size I requested. It was a bit smelly but kind of like when renting a motel room- not sure about the previous guests. The rental agent was pleasant and the return agent at the airport was friendly. He reminded me to check for any items I may have left behind. The day to day rates are cheap for Hertz when compared to other car rental places  but they get you with the car insurance. It's not required  but I always get it. You never know what may happen to you and it's better to be covered.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Everything went smoothly for me. I reserved a compact car and got there a bit less than an hour before my reserved time. I got a Chevy Spark. Wow is that car tiny and crappy. Usually at Alamo when I reserve a compact I get a Corolla or Golf  sometimes even get a free upgrade to an Elantra. The Spark is so small the gas tank is only 8 gallons! But it was enough to get all the way to Alhambra.  Don't let these pics uploaded here fool you. Those are all stock pics. This office is very small. They don't have a lot of cars here. When I was returning my car I heard one employee call a customer saying they didn't have the exotic car she had reserved and would not be able to get one.  The car was only $24/day  so can't really complain. My usual standby Alamo was almost double at $45  but like I said  I probably would have gotten a better car. I probably wouldn't come back to Hertz unless I can't get something from Alamo.  If you want to add another driver that is your spouse  you can do so for free  but for some reason they ask you if you have AAA. Alamo does not limit adding a driver (spouse) for free only to people who use AAA.  Oh yeah  the car was totally not cleaned when I got it. There was white hairs all over the interior. Looked like animal hair.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,The best Rental place in town. Cars were always clean. Well maintained and great selections. Prices are good as well and everyone has great attitude. That is why I always rent from them almost every month and a half.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Ordered the Hertz car at the PALMS resort in Las Vegas for 9:00 and the next day and when we arrived at 9:00 the Hertz representative was not there. At 9:45 we received a call to pick up the car.  When we went to the car we found it dirty inside and out. The car had recently been smoked in as well. Standard dings and dents for a rental car with 34 000 miles.  Ford Focus 2013 ran poorly  sputtered often on acceleration.   Went to drop the car off EXACTLY 48 hours after we picked it up. Of course the Hertz representative had to finish her text before we were served. Computer down unable to print invoice but was assured invoice would be emailed asap.  A day later received invoice and was billed an EXTRA HOUR for bringing the car back. Of course nothing mentioned the fact that we picked up the car 45 minutes LATE.  Poor service will not use HERZ again.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Such an pain free experience.   I arrived and was greeted in the parking lot by the new manager. I was in and out when I picked up the car.   When I returned the car I had to let them know that a rock had chipped the windshield and they completely understood and explained the process.   I would definitely rent a car from hertz again !
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Prompt service  good overall experience.  Plan to rent from Hertz again.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Suzanna at Hertz (Las Vegas airport) was great.  I was done in less than 10 minutes without a reservation.  I walked accross the lobby from Dollar  who screwed up my reservation and treated me very poorly.  It was nice to be treated like a customer by Suzanna.  Return was very easy and a receipt was printed in the lot upon return.  I am very happy with HERTZ and I will be using them for all of my future car rental needs.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Best staff we've come across at a rental agency.  We had a problem with the car and they offered another one  although we didn't take it  they deducted a days rental from the bill.  Treated us with respect.  Very professional.
Hotels & Travel;Car Rental,Great service and fast. They work with you on the car you want . Hertz is the best car rental will Continue to use them
Flowers & Gifts;Florists;Shopping,"Never recommend. Received flower for birthday gift from friends in Hawaii. I was very happy that my friends did such a nice thing to surprise me. However I was also very sad and upset to this flower shop who took advantage of online/phone order from my friend. They ordered white lily thou they sent me pink ""almost dead"" lily instead.  When I received flower  it was already yellow on tips  broken stems  leaf falling off... It was too bad that I had to call this flower shop to just letting them know what's going on. They asked me to send pic of flower. So I did. They asked me to send pic of card that was with flower. (As they claim they can't find delivery history...) so I did.  Yet no action nor response from them! They are the one asked me to send pics and I did so  but no reply from them at all. Just MIA! What a nice gesture after sending ""almost dead"" flower to customer.... Never recommend. Just don't waste your money to these guys."
Flowers & Gifts;Florists;Shopping,This florist gave my bouquets a personal touch. I had shared what I wanted to order  but that it was a celebration of life. She immediately recreated exactly what I was looking for. Of course she sent a picture first  but it was stunning. She was efficient  creative  and caring. I will be referring her to my friends. Thank you again Roses Today!
Flowers & Gifts;Florists;Shopping,I was pleased with their service. I have ordered from larger companies in the past but thought I would give them a try. I was not disappointed  the flowers arrived just as shown in the photos. I will be ordering from this company in the future.
Flowers & Gifts;Florists;Shopping,Poor performance bad arrangements argumentive with customers   put in a formal compliant with proflowers .. Hopefully they will not used again by proflowers
Flowers & Gifts;Florists;Shopping,Thank you Roses Today LV.  You delivered to my friend when other closer florists would not.  You were also pleasant and professional to work with.  Thank you.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"You cannot leave Vegas until you eat lunch at Todd English's Olives outdoor balcony at the Bellagio.  The view is beautiful and you get a clear view of the ""dancing water"" show while enjoying your meal.  We decided to eat here right before our flight and it was a great idea ordering 3 rounds of their lovely mojitos   making the airport wait bearable.  I ordered the Seared Pacific Northwest Salmon and it was mouthwatering perfection.    +5 because the food and the experience was worth the price.  Which  if you think about it  most of us don't pay attention to expenses when we are on vacation."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a beautiful experience we had! From the host to our server  then the food and the fountain show...everything was perfect! We got lucky and snagged up a seat on the patio right up front. Most definitely recommend this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This review is for the bar and some appetizers at said bar.  While the Bellagio may be known as ""classy"" and ""sophisticated "" it isn't  and once we walked into the hotel after the fountain spectacle  we searched for a refuge.  The ""Barbarians were at the Gate "" and we were running for some  any oasis.  We covered our eyes and dulled our senses and ducked into Todd English's Olives.    Years ago  we ate at the original in Boston and wondered about the ""big deal."" Little did we know  Olives would become institution.   The bar at Olives in the Bellagio was wonderful.  Curtis  our bartender  took personal care of us  making us feel separated from the hordes that were attacking the Bellagio. We had drinks  a salad  and a hamburger.  They were all great.  However  the food was secondary to the comfort we felt being cared for by Curtis  after the onslaught of the Strip  a strangulation of the soul and reality.  Olives felt like the ""promised land "" and unlike Moses  I was allowed to experience it."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic location with amazing fountain views. The food is very good  namely tuna tartar appetizer. Good wine selection.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice restaurant  good food and GREAT service.  Chris V was our waiter and he was very personable  went above and beyond to give us an really enjoyable experience and he wasn't afraid to tell us what he really liked.  Ask for him if you go  you can tell he likes his job!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Located in a prime location in Las Vegas  we were surprised that the food was decently priced.  Since we had a big group  we were seated away from the water fountains  but the decor inside the restaurant was pretty pleasing to the eyes anyway.   Tried the pork tenderloins due to the strong recommendations here  and I was not disappointed. The meat was juicy and perfectly cooked. The portion was also sizable enough for a full night of partying.  The complimentary bread came with two different olive spreads  and turned me into a fan of olives.  -1 star for the awkward music playing. For the duration of our meal  there was some trance song  and it definitely didn't fit the mood of a fancy meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  great views and our waiter Paul gave us the best service we had on our entire trip.  We had to wait about an hour for patio seating   but it was well worth it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,***************************** 1 030 *******************************         How come I've never written a review here? One of the most decorated  respected  and charismatic chefs in the world  Todd English has enjoyed a staggering number of accolades during his remarkable career. Also to his credit  English has authored the critically acclaimed cookbooks  The Olives Table  The Figs Table and The Olives Dessert Table published by Simon & Schuster. He's been in countless television shows  publications  and what not.       This Las Vegas offering of a Todd English favorite features a Mediterranean-style experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of Lake Bellagio. House-made pastas  steaks  rotisserie dishes  brick oven pizzas and sommelier-recommended wines complement the dining atmosphere. If you get a patio table during lunch time here  it's so nice to watch the water show at the Bellagio Fountain.      A charming and handsome talented chef  however  you will rarely catch him here because Executive Sous Chef Abraham Aguilar is the one in charges here daily. However  chef Todd English is usually here during some of the food and wines events  and you will surely catch him. He's quite a nice gentleman  beside a great chef.   - Grilled Squid and Octopus - vinaigrette of chickpeas  tomatoes  toasted garlic  parsley - was always a hit.  - Beef Carpaccio - gorgonzola polenta  parmesan  cipollini onions  balsamic reduction  scallion cream  garlic aioli is a MUST ORDER  - Flatbread - Fig & Prosciutto rosemary crust  sweet & sour fig jam  gorgonzola  prosciutto di parma - delicious.  - Spicy PEI Mussels - charred tomatoes  green onions  fresh jalapenos  garlicky chablis emulsion  capellini pasta  basil oil  herbed crostini - is always 1 of my FAV here.   - Braised Lamb Shank - stewed french lentils  wilted kale  natural lamb jus  rosemary sprig - probably 1 of the BEST on the strip  if not the the best.        I love coming here for lunch more than dinner  the vibe  the water show  the good service  and the consistent of the food  very reasonable price point for the strip  and all the top notch boutiques around here  perfect spot for a shopping break  as if I have any money left from donating to the tables.      If you are a M Life member  most likely your VIP host can comp you here :-)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really enjoyed the food and service.  The restaurant is in the Bellagio and you can either eat or step onto the balcony and see the fountain dance.  Such a romantic place we saw one guy get on his knee and propose on  the balcony to his girlfriend.  I had a seafood meal with mussles and clams.  Foget the exact name of it  but it was topped with pasta and was wonderful  I usually am disappointed with those kind of meals because most restaurants will throw in a few clams and mussels and call it a meal.  There must have been over a dozen combined steamed shellfish in mine.  Need to make a reservation because they are booked regularly.  We ended up with a late night dinner  around 9:30  but that gave us plenty of time to enjoy the strip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,first of all  we got an amazing seat on the patio with a front row view of the bellagio water show.  we've seen it a hundred times  but for some reason  it was so much better while sitting here eating a delicious dinner.  the ambiance is cool...kinda loud inside and looks very crowded.  but we are here to review the food.  the chocolate bread was awesome...i hate it when i like the bread  cuz i just fill up on that.  we also got the portobello flatbread.  the crust was a tad soggy in the middle  but it was very tasty!!  the greek style romaine  was good.  a little too much dressing.  entrees....butternut squash tortelli.  my husband liked it better than i did.  i thought it was a little too sweet.  i got the rib eye.  i don't know why i always get steak wherever i go.  it was solid  but i've had better.  i guess i shouldn't get steak unless i'm at a steakhouse.  oh well.  their cocktails are pretty amazing.  sooo yummy.  we would go back  but probably order different things.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"As my wife is a vegetarian  and she loves the following dish  we targeted this place based on a review of the Butternut Squash Ravioli in which the reviewer noted ""it was the best she's ever had"".  It was good  but clearly not the best ever.  The sauce was a classic sage brown butter with a bit more to it than that which we've made at home.  The dish couldn't touch a local Sherman Oaks Il Tiramisu Ristorante: Crispelle di Zucca which is so far the winner as crowned by my wife. That said.  My steak was very good as to be expected  their wine list was quite impressive (and priced correctly) and the place had some views of the water show with hotel Paris in the windows.  The lighting suggests romance  but we were sat at a half booth table in which the booth seat was shared  so intimacy was a bit intruded.  Noise level was medium.   I'd say the place was very good  and really a place to bring a larger group of people and kids would be fine too.  Their seating will accomodate anything.  Value for the money was right on."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food on the Vegas Strip is hit or miss  and this one hits more than it misses.  We walked in for lunch on a beautiful Saturday and were told it was a one hour wait for a outside terrace table.  The hostess told us though that as tables open up  if the next party on the list isn't there  they give the table to the next party - like you have to be present to win.  Because of that  we had a seat at the bar and were served by Jimmy V.  an old-school bartender who was quick and friendly.  The wines by the glass selection is quite good so I had a nice French Chablis and my lunch companion had a S. African Chenin Blanc.  Very nice.  Well only about 10 minutes had passed when we were told that our table was ready!  That was a nice surprise.  There's a reason why the outside terrace area is in high demand and it's because of the waterside view of the spectacular Bellagio fountains.  What a beautiful setting.  Having a front row seat to that bombastic display is a bit distracting but in a good way.  The food was uneven.  A nice bread basket  some tapenade and olives came promptly.  I had the soft shelled crab sandwich which was nicely done - pleasantly spiced with Sriracha.  It was served with skinny fries - skinny sized not skinny in calories!  These were tasty but unfortunately were cold.  My companion had the beef carpaccio which was a huge serving of paper thin raw beef served with a small salad  a gorgonzola polenta  cipollini onions  scallion cream  balsamic reduction  garlic aioli and shaved parmesan.  That's a lot of stuff!  Despite the plethora of accoutrements  I found the dish to be strangely bland.  There wasn't even a whiff of blue cheese in that polenta.  (In their defense  we were told the blue cheese flavor in the polenta was mild.)  Service was prompt  friendly and knowledgable.  It's hard to do good food at a place with such a nice view.  No matter how good the food is  no one ever remembers it.  The view however was spectacular!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Exceptional dining experience. Have had this restaurant on my list due to his view of the bellagio fountain. We dined here on a rather cold night but we were still able to enjoy the gorgeous view from an inside table by the window.   We had a reservation but arrived a little early. We were sat within an acceptable time and greeted by our server Michelle. She was a fantastic server  very presentable  open and friendly and able to provide recommendations and/or opinions when asked about certain dishes. We enjoyed the pre fixed menu which consisted of a caprese salad which was served with cherry tomato  chunks of mozzarela all atop a micro basil base and salmon cakes which was definitely a generous size.  Also ordered the rack of lamb which was cooked to perfection. Presentation was eye appealing as well served atop mashed potatoes. To end the dining experience we had cheesecake.    Service overall was 5 star.  She touched our table just enough for us to never think ""where is our server"". Our food was served within acceptable times between each course.   Fine dining experience satisfaction!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here on our last nite in Vegas yesterday.  We wanted to sit outside but the wait was an hour and we had a flight to catch so we just ended up sitting inside. the food  I thought it was pretty good.  We did the restaurant week menu.  which includes:  Buffalo Mozzarella in Carrozza : mozzarella wrapped in house made pasta  heirloom tomatoes parmesan creama  balsamic roasted red onion  basil flakes -  this was pretty good...very cheesy...i liked it because i love cheese but my friend thought it was too much...good portions and the vegetables was yummy  Char Grilled Kobe Skirt Steak : summer ratatouille  red wine bordelaise  maytag blue cheese croutons  crispy fried onion rings -  huge huge portion  i didn't finish mine cuz it was too much food.  the steak was okay  a little chewy and I normally don't eat steak ... but I thought it was okay   Mudslide Ice Cream Sandwich : double chocolate espresso cookies  bailey's ice cream kahlua chocolate glaze  caramel sauce - yummmyyy...loved it...  the meal was 50 per person.  with tips and tax  it was 62 per person but I thought it was well worth it for the size of the meal that we got.  i would definitely go back and try something else next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I heart this place like no other in vegas....  I - hello- Got your attention?  YEAH I LOVE THIS PLACE.  Its costly...Come on...its in the Bellagio...You expecting K-mart prices?    No blue light special here dears.  But they have the best drinks in vegas...THE BEST.  The slingback is my favorite by far.  My family knows that if you end up in vegas with us...you will end up here atleast one night....if not at the bar several nights.  Love it.  Services has always been good  food is always good.  Love it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I saw Bill Clinton here!   The food was fine - kind of forgettably good really - but what wasn't forgettable was seeing ol' Bill. He sat at the outdoor terrace next to the Bellagio fountains (I almost asked to sit out there  too!). Crowds of people outside the restaurant at every window clamored for a look. We were just as bad trying to surreptitiously take photos.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This restaurant is located in the Bellagio Hotel and is best known for there Mediterranean-style experience set against the breathtaking backdrop of Lake Bellagio water show.  Service:  We had a reservation for 3 at 6:45pm and we all were running a little late but the staff held our table we all go there around 7:30pm. We were very happy they waited for us. We were instantly greeted by our waiter his name was Carl and he reminded me of Steve Harvey and he was really funny too. I knew at that point we were gonna have a good night.  He was very professional and knew the menu to a T. He recommend the popular drinks and allow us to go over the menu.   Drinks/Starters: My wife order some really sweet mixed drink that looked like a can of motor oil in a cup. I just ordered a beer and my boss order a glass of wine. They gave us bread on the table at OMG it was wonderful. It was like a raisin nut scrumdiddlyumptious roll and 3 different type olive dipping sauce. It's not good when the bread is delicious because you want more and more but then you get too full and you can't eat your dinner.  We decide to order some appetizers. My wife order Foie Gras for $26.00 and i understand why. I ate her Foie Gras in hawaii. Sorry hun. My boss and I tried the ""Greek"" Style Romaine Salad with tomato  cucumber  cracked olives  red onion  feta phyllo triangle  oregano dressing for $17.00 ea. It was great I thought maybe that it might be weird tasting but all the ingredients work really well together. I was impressed and so was my boss.  Our Carl i mean waiter was johnny on the spot which the refills and taking our orders which was great because we could see he was very busy but still makes time for us. I loved the service. 5 stars all the way.  Entrees: My Wife and I order the Chilean Sea Bass with cannellini bean & sausage cassoulet  garlicky broccolini  oj glaze  watercress for $46.00 ea. We throughly enjoyed the meal but sadly we have had better in Newport Beach  Ca and that might be because the fish is more fresh there and Vegas fish is frozen. I am not sure but it was still good. 3 stars.  My Boss ordered Linguine Alle Vongole with littleneck clams  red pepper flakes  white wine & garlic  parsley for $36.00. He said it was really good and he loves Vongole and it was right on point.   Dessert: We order a Mango  Berry  Watermelon Sorbet which was 3 scoops and it was so silky and amazing. Not to sweet and bit tangy. We all shared it and it was perfect because my wife likes mango  I liked the watermelon and my boss loves the berry and it couldn't be more perfect.  Experience: Overall the total service and meal were 5 stars and I would definately come back when we are in Vegas again. It was rad that our table was close to the window because we could see the Water Show while we were dining. We left with full belly and great memories.  Thanks Olives aka Carl for making our night and to my boss for paying for everything. Cheers!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I am giving Olives two stars because what we ended up getting to eat was good.  D had a tuna tartare that was really nice  but extremely spicy.  English (or whoever) threw a wrench into the works by adding some shrimps  nice.  I ate a gigantic beef carpaccio....GIGANTIC and delicious.  However  that's where the fun ended.  We waited over 30 minutes for our entrees before bolting.  And one of the bartenders was an outright bitch.  Rude as hell.  The other bartender was a peach.  They made us talk to the manager before allowing us to cancel our entrees and pay the bill.  Whatever.  Will not be going back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Interesting appetizers and whatever. Try it at least once  but I wasn't too crazy about it. I'm usually hammered at these places  so all I remember is fuzzy bits and whether or not I was swooned...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My husband and I made a reservation here since it was in our hotel. We got there about 30 minutes early so we could wait in line to sit outside near the fountains. We met a nice couple and chatted with them for a bit.  We got front row seats to the fountain show outside and it was definitely worth the wait. We ordered the fig flatbread and it was delicious! Then for our main meal I got the chicken and mashed potatoes! So good. My husband got the boar tenderloin and he loved it! Highly recommend if you are looking to treat yourself and watch the fountain shows!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a birthday celebration there with a group of friends while there in Vegas  and we had a great dinner!   We had the fig & proscuitto flatbread  along with the filet au pouivre and both were terrific. The waitress/server we had was also top notch - she was attentive  accomodating  and hilarious. Did not hear one complaint out of our entire group the restaurant. One recommendation I would give is that if you can make reservations outside on the patio - do it! The pation overlooks the Bellagio fountain  and it would add another great experience to the meal..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I make it a point to go to Olives every time I'm in Las Vegas. It's delicious!   Every time I go  I order the butternut squash tortellini--it's perfectly seasoned  and there's lots of squash with just the right amount of noodle. They also bring this neat assortment of breads with olives on the side as an appetizer.   The cocktails are also wonderful  and the service is pretty excellent too. But  my favorite part of all is the view! You can see the Bellagio fountains go off at night. It's a great view during dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Tuna app was amazing  best raw preparation I've had in a long time.  The flatbreads are great too.  I had the tenderloin and it was tender  juicy  and delicious.  I highly recommend!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Iron Chef America  not Iron Chef International.  So I heard that Todd English was an Iron Chef for Iron Chef America. I was excited to see what kind of food his restaurant Olives could present. I must say that the decor isn't too bad as the seats are comfortable and the olive theme really stood out.   However  when the food display after arriving looked less than average and its taste was exactly how it looked.   I can't help but to give this restaurant only 3 stars because it doesn't live up to its standards of what an Iron Chef restaurant should taste like. If this was Iron Chef food  the show better watch out because I can be the next Iron Chef America.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love Todd English and his food. That wasn't the problem .It's the service. Our waiter was horrible  forgot our salad and then made an excuse. If you forget something you should just apologize and go get it.  We just cancelled it because it took so long. It took 40 minutes to get a bottle of wine. He told us to hurry up and order because the kitchen was closing soon. I have worked in fine dining before  even chain restaurants  and you can never tell the customer to hurry up and order  you have to take someone even if they walk in 1 minute before closing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I usually go here for a special occasion and it never disappoints. The food is amazing and the staff are so friendly and helpful. I would recommend asking for a table on the patio when possible as you can enjoy the Bellagio fountain show every 15 minutes while you eat.  It is a little more expensive but worth it  the atmosphere  the food and the drinks make a visit here very special. So far I would recommend everything that I have tried  which includes the scallops  the sirloin steak and the chicken. The truffle mac and cheese extra is a must have. Cocktails are good value  and they are strong so would really only have one or two.   This spot is great whether your with a group or looking for a romantic  intimate meal.  (also you can reserve tables online at the Bellagio website  very convenient)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here for dinner and ordered the carpaccio  muffaletta flatbread  seared scallops  and the braised boar pappardelle. This was quite a bit of food for a nice restaurant. We probably could have left out one of the items.   The carpaccio was tasty and came draped over a pile of salad and a polenta cake. As everyone says  the portion size is quite large. The muffaletta flatbread  again good size  was topped with a salad that helped cut the saltiness of the shaved meats. The scallops (we got 4 large scallops) were a bit inconsistent - 2 were over salted  and the other 2 were perfect. Who knows what happened there. The papardelle was good  but I wish the dish had been a bit meatier (mixing in the red wine sauce that came on the side made it more flavorful).   Our server was very familiar with the menu and caught a mistake on one of our plates (no salad atop the flatbread) as he was about the serve it. He was also very attentive despite having a full section.  Oh  and the cocktails that we got were pretty strong.   Overall  a pretty good meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you go to Olives  you MUST sit outside so you can see and hear the water show effectively. Olives is connected with the Bellagio  and they have their famous fountains in front of the casino/resort.  The water show is so impressive.  It doesn't matter the heat  you must sit outside if you go to Olives!  If it wasn't for the water show  Olives would have probably gotten a 2 star review. The food was way overpriced for the amount you got and it wasn't all that delicious.  It wasn't bad food  but it wasn't good food.  The service was fine. The other customers were about the eclectic mix you would expect in Las Vegas  which leads to great people watching.  While they have misters outside to try to keep it not as hot for the customers  there are not nearly enough of them  and they could have had more umbrellas.  It is probably worth it to go to Olives though for the water show!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overall: The service here was impeccable. The view (if you're able to get a seat over lake Bellagio) is even better! It is very difficult to find a good charcuterie place on the Strip  and I'd have to say that this place is my favorite.  My recommendation is that you go early to get a good table  and also indulge in the appetizers/drinks! I can't imagine how crowded this place must be on the weekends  but my boyfriend and I went on a weeknight and were able to get a table easily!  Food: It does seem to me that you pay a premium on the food due to the fact that the view from the restaurant is absolutely beautiful. However  I'm not sure if that's a fair judgement based on the fact that I wasn't able to try everything on the menu. My boyfriend had the stroganoff (the special) and I had the butternut squash. Of course we also had charcuterie (which if I could  I'd give a 10/5!)   Ambiance: While the yelp review lists that the restaurant is casual  I did see some nicely-dressed individuals during our dinner! I think you can get away with business casual  especially if you're intending on setting outside. The Bellagio water show is absolutely stunning to watch from the outside patio  especially during sunset. The restaurant also offers photography for purchase for anyone sitting outdoors  but my boyfriend and I found that the waiters did a great job of capturing the moment for us on our iPhones (yay technology!)  Service: If the review was based on service alone  I would give the restaurant a 10/5! The server we had whose name was Ann was absolutely wonderful  and kind. When we left the restaurant my boyfriend and I encountered a small health incident and the staff at the restaurant were responsive  attentive  and so kind!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Had a fabulous flatbread with prosciutto topped with 2 perfectly fried eggs.    Salad was just simple greens with a great dressing (can't remember  rec by server)   and the presentation was lovely.   This is my third lunch visit in the last couple of years and I've always been more than     happy. Last time I had a Caesar ""Napoleon"" salad with frico layers that was heaven.   Wonderful place serving stellar food at decent prices for Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,People go out to eat for three main reasons  atmosphere  appetite  and asthetic appeal. I call it the AAA experience. OLiVES had almost all of it ! I managed in the industry for nearly 5 years and serviced for nearly ten. Atmospere was phenomenal! Our table overlooked the Bellagio Lake for amazing air conditioned views of the fabulous fountain view. Asthetics were on point. Our Server Jamie (super cute)  went above and beyond no questions asked. Shes an exceptionsl human. Our appetites were met in size  but not flavor. Beef carpaccio was wonderful cheese platter was too expensive for the small portion but tasty. All entrees had great portion sizes. Gnocci was great. Steak was ok it was their seafood scallops that tasted fishy. I guess I should have known that i was in themiddle of the desert lol. It was my 30th birthday and oir experience was wonderful over all . They changed my first order without question. also they provided a wonderful photographer who did a great job capturing our beloves evening. Thank you OLiVES for helping me start out my 30's with class and grace. Experience this if you have an opportunity.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Generally speaking  Vegas Strip restaurants are way overpriced and rarely deliver on expectations associated with the price tag.   While Olives is quite overpriced  the redeeming factor it does possess is the view or THE VIEW  I should say. Its terrace is overlooking the Bellagio fountains. So if you can  do wait for the outdoor patio seating because the dinner and show are amazing!  The food is pretty good too. Our two disappointments were: 1) my sirloin came out lukewarm (looks like the dish was waiting for the waiter for a while). Not sure if the reheated it or brought out a new one because the second time the meat was well done as opposed to medium like I ordered. Either way  I expect that a place charging $49 for the dish does not make rookie mistakes like this. (Minus one star)  2) that it was my wife's birthday (I did mention it several times when reserving and upon ordering our drinks) and they did nothing special for her. We were too full for dessert  but they should have done something (minus one star)  Otherwise this would have been a full 5 star rating.   Try it out for yourselves  and hopefully your experience is more complete!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was one of the best meals we have had in Las Vegas! After having eaten at most of the steakhouses on the Strip we decided to give Olives a try. We shared an appetizer of escargot served with a red wine reduction. Plenty to share between the two of us  the sauce was nice. I ordered the sea bass with mushroom risotto for my entree and my husband ordered the pork tenderloin roulade. We both really enjoyed these dishes. I normally do not order fish  but this was really good!! We both shared two desserts  the mango creme brulee and the banana  tiramisu. Both of these dishes were yummy!! We enjoyed everything about this dining experience. We will be back again  with requesting a table with a view of the fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The arrogant bartender with the Irish brogue needs an infusion of professionalism! While my Fazzoletti with shredded veal and fontina with truffle emulsion was excellent (by the way  I'd never heard of this type of pasta; it's thin and flat  approx three inches square)  the bartender could be overheard making snarky comments and telling patrons his Director was stupid.  He brought the place down and lessened the experience.  He could learn a lot from Curtis at Circo!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I had a very pleasant dining experience here and made dinner reservation through Open Table. Upon checking in  we were promptly seated at our reserved time. I really appreciate that they honored my request to be seated outside  on the patio  as we had a great view of the Bellagio water show while we dined. I also appreciate that they have taken notice to the comment I had left on Open Table that we there to celebrate my wife's birthday. To our surprise  they brought out a special little birthday dessert towards the end of our dinner service.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=Zt2T-QknvZbfBb__KMYDKw  After being seated at our table  they left us with an iPad that was an interactive wine/cocktail menu  which I thought was pretty nifty and cool. After ordering cocktails  we started with the Tuna Tartare  and it was nicely flavorful of fresh tuna. For the entrees  we went with our waiter's recommendation. My wife went with the Sea Scallops which was delicious  and I went with the Pan Seared Northern Halibut. My halibut was exactly as our waiter had described it would taste  and everything from the fish to the bed of risotto it sat on was outstanding.  Tuna Tartare: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=5Hrez-r5YEVrIq2g1SmCDw  Sea Scallops: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=soHdUh_514gHA79oLN334w  Pan Seared Northern Halibut: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=Bmk8WNWpZiirNBmAqDclAg  All around service was superb  particularly our waiter. He was very attentive and checked on us often  yet we never felt like we were being rushed. He was even polite enough to offer to take a photo of us together with a glimpse of the water show behind us. I am very pleased with the level of service Olive's was able to provide my wife and I on her special day.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Upon my return to Olives  I had one of the most romantic and wonderful experiences ever in Las Vegas. The food was exceptional  the service was out standing. But what took my breath away is sitting outside next to the fountains at night during a full summer moon. I felt like we weren't in Las Vegas  between the cuisine  wine and service. Thank you so much for this wonderful experience and I can't wait to go back upon my next visit to Las Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wife and I did our last day lunch here at Olives as we always do every year. What an awesome place. We always enjoy that meal on the balcony not only for the fountains but because our server has to be the best at providing a wonderful experience. To be sure every entree has fulfilled every expectation of killer cuisine. Creative and full of flavor so to leave the palet watering for more. Chef Todd's beef tartare is truly the best creation ever. A platter of thinly sliced prime over a bed of crisp greens and polenta. Garnished with lightly roasted cippollini onions and large shavings of reggiano  drizzled with tasty aioli  and hefty enough to be a meal in itself  but share cause it's that good. Creative pastas and flatbreads  grilled seafood and meats  especially the lamb chops yummy.a great assortment of mixed drink creations make the meals magic. Next time you pass thru the Bellagio  step in  ask for a seat outside  sit back and enjoy one of the great cocktails and if you see me  wave and smile. We look forward to lunch soon  Happy New Year Grey.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a lovely lunch overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The cauliflower flatbread pizza was full of great flavor and perfect for lunch.  My husband highly enjoyed his grilled squid and octopus with chickpeas  which was impressive since he is not a huge chickpeas fan.  Nice wine list too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have always had a delightful and positive experience at Olives. I'm vegan and try to go to places that will not be irritated with my requests. Olives has always been attentive to my vegan requests and the meals have always been delightful. However  on Sunday evening the 27th of December 2015 a couple of girlfriends and I had dinner and our waiter John was attentive to my vegan needs and alerted me of things that I could not eat. When I requested a vegetable plate and John wrote specifically that I was vegan. When my food arrived the vegetables had no seasoning and were overly cooked. Thank goodness I had ordered the beet salad  which was flavorful  tasty and extremely delightful. The vegetables were prepared in a way that lacked culinary creativity. In other words  I could have prepared these at home. I will go again  but this particular evening I am disappointed with my Olives experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best! Had an incredible dinner on the patio. Great service and great food. The Fresh baked bread is unreal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Total waste of money. It might be worth it if you sit outside to view the fountains but that would be it. It was so loud inside that my wife and I gave up on trying to yell out a conversation and communicated by hand signals. A loud restaurant I can forgive  but the food was also poorly cooked and flavorless. My Ribeye  if it even was a Ribeye  was cut so thin it could have been a skirt steak. It was also burnt and greasy. Then they covered it in a bland red wine reduction that literally had no flavor. My wife's chillian sea bass was dry and her beans were under cooked and hard. The only saving grace was the bread and tapenad. Never again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Two words.  BEEF CARPACCIO!  By far the best I've ever had.  Melt in your mouth beef.  It was great.  Almost as good as wagyu sushi.  I also had braised english shortribs  which was also tasty  but the beef carpaccio was soooo good I ordered two.  This place also had a great wine list  and great service.  The sommelier brought us a new bottle of wine the very moment he realized  he had dropped tiny bit of cork into the bottle.  It was so dark in there I wouldn't have even realized.  Prices are quite reasonable too.  The carpaccio alone gets five stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Pretty disappointed after reading the reviews. The Tortelli was too buttery/sweet and was served cold in the center. The flatbread was below average - tasted like a bake-at-home pizza from your local grocery store. Much like all restaurants in Vegas  quite expensive  but the food wasn't even tasty. Definitely not worth the time & money.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service: No Food: Good Ambiance: Fantastic  We ordered:  Eggplant Parmigiana flatbread roasted roma tomato  caramelized onions  fresh buffalo mozzarella   garlicky bread crumbs  pistachio basil pesto.....18  - The flatbread was pretty good. Considering I don't eat veggies  I dug this. This is green eggplant not purple  which threw my mom off. Was a little greasy but still good.  Porterhouse Steak  crispy fried lobster mac & cheese  shiraz demi glaze  butter braised broccoli  red pepper puree.....56  - Ordered medium-well and it came out fairly rare. The demit glaze was amazing and the steak was very  very tender almost falling off the bone. The lobster mac n cheese was ice cold (probably sitting around waiting for the steak). One of the men standing around noticed my discontent and attempted to fix the situation by offering to bring out a warm side and he did  however he brought out the wrong side. Crab cake!! And it was bomb. Not right but nice effort.  Rainbow Trout  came with Brussel Sprouts risotto? and something else.. $38?  - Mom got the special for the day and enjoyed her meal greatly. She said she wished there were more brussel sprouts.  Bill ended up being $163 before tip. Not bad. Two entrees  the flatbread as an app  two glasses of wine and dessert. I was expecting it to end up being about $230 without tip.  Considering how many people I send here a week and how much they all pay for dinner I was expecting service to be top notch. It was not. My server was less than attentive. I think he was either trying to get laid or get a big tip from the six top of chicks sitting a few tables away. I decided to bring my mother out to a nice dinner and the service was lacking. My mothers been a waitress herself for 25+ years and I myself work in the industry (Concierge at a SISTER PROPERTY) and we both thought the server sucked. I don't think I'll be back despite how good the food was.  Oh and the server ended up getting screwed because his party of six all wanted seperate checks and paid with credit cards. Karma for you buddy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were very disappointed with this place. We had an 8:30 reservation and the hostess said she'd be right with us while helping people who didn't have a reservation for 10 minutes. We were informed we'd have to wait until 10:15 to be sat outside  but could sit us at a table next to the window (with two fat people immediately in front of outside blocking the view). Oh well  the interior was super nice  dark and very romantic feeling.   Our awesome busser quickly brought us three great kinds of bread  some olive tapenade and Pellegrino quickly. Our pretentious sommelier was quick to assist us  but looked down at my selection (a $125 bottle of Stag's Leap Cabernet). I got the very distinct feeling for some reason  because Im young they thought I didn't have money or something ridiculous.  Our waiter dropped off our menu and then seemed to completely forget about us. We finally waved him down and ordered the tuna tartar as non-spicy as possible  the sweet potato gnocchi and the grilled sirloin.   The tuna tartar came out pretty quick and was very good. A little too spicy and raw for my date  but I loved it. After that  it took what seemed like forever for our food to arrive. My date loved the sweet potato gnocchi. My steak was cooked to the correct doneness  but per the usual for steakhouses  needed more salt. This  and I had no idea what it was that accompanied my steak. Server was nowhere to be found. I finally flag him down and he explains what was on my plate  but I'm not sure what this was. HAHA... I asked him for salt  but it never came. After 15 minutes or so  I flagged down the busser who hooked it up.   We finally got the bill and got our food wrapped up. Place was incredibly overpriced for the service and quality of food is not worth it. Its the same price as Bouchon  so I would recommend anyone in Vegas to go there instead.   Oh  all this AND they double charged me. Im still disputing that as we speak...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you ever want to eat somewhere with delicious food and have stunning views of the water show at the Bellagio  this is the place to be!   Olive's had incredible service and appetizing food! My boyfriend and I had our Anniversary dinner here and let me just say  it is one that I'll never forget.   A few tips: Make reservations and if you don't mind eating a early dinner  make it for 5  that's when dinner starts. You'll for sure get a good window seat or patio seat. Order a drink  a nice dinner is not complete without a tasty drink. We ordered bellinis and they were perfect. Don't eat too much bread because the portions are pretty decent. From experience  It was pretty hard for me to stop snacking on the bread and olives. But you want room for their mouthwatering entrees!   I had the ricotta raviolis with italian sausage and my boyfriend had the goat cheese dumplings with shrimp  this was mainly where my 5 star rating came from. The food was amazingly delectable!!!!!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Make sure to get a flatbread dish.  I had one with prosciutto and figs.  Wow.  I paired my meal with a Spanish mencia wine.  If you are ordering several dishes  split the pasta because it is way too much for one person.  I loved my butternut squash ravioli dish  but I had a lot left over.  Dessert was really cool.  It was a tea infused creme brulee with lemon scones.  A very Iron Chef interpretation of tea with scones  to say the least.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent! My wife and I loved our visit here. The food and ambience were great. The staff was above and beyond. It was simply excellent. We went on a Friday around seven and showed up early in order to get a table in the patio. Highly recommend to show up early about an hour earlier than your reservation to get a table outside in the patio if you wish. The patio is key if you want to take in the Bellagio Fountains. Video attached. The food was over the top. It had great flavor! We had the Mac and cheese  flatbread  and Nebraska tenderloin. Would definitely get all of it again. The staff was very friendly and allowed us to take it all in and take our time; we were there for about three hours! It was great and well worth it. The only nuisances to sitting where we were was that the house photographer takes photos right next to your table. I probably caught at least two elbows. Big nuisance because of the volume. And we weren't even offered a picture  but that's ok. The manager asked us to move a few feet over to make room for another table and by then my annoyance level had tipped over  but the manager was great. He took care of the inconvenience with a free dessert and was very polite  I think his name was Sean Michael. I will definitely come back because it was a great experience  the food was delicious  and the staff except for the photographer were great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I ate at Olives for the first time this last Friday and it was amazing! Not only did we have the best server ever (Michelle) but the food was to die for...all while watching the amazing water show! Thank you Olives (and Michelle) for the awesome experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,OLiVES knocked it out of the park. Service was fantastic and the meal (Scallops with mushroom risotto) was very good.  Our starters  a Bibb salad was unimpressive but nicely presented. The Steak tartare was very good.  The restaurant graciously accommodated my wife's gluten-free needs
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best restaurant I have ever been. Wonderful ambience  awesome food and impeccable service.  Amazing breads and olives of course. Definitely a must stop if in Las Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Do your self a favor   if you want to make sure you will be seated after waiting in the bar   don't check in with the host by the name Alex ( you will be waiting for ever )  she is unprofessional and Arrogant
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food: 3.5 or 4 (depending on what you get) Service: 4 Decor: 4.5  Located inside the Bellagio  this is one of the restaurants that has outdoor seating right in front of the water. Too bad it was so hot  otherwise it would have been sweet to sit outside.   For lunch my boyfriend and I ordered the Tuna Carpaccio and Lamb Ribs for our appetizers. Personally  I think our appetizers were so much better than our actual entree but oh well. The Tuna Carpaccio was surprisingly good  even though it was a huge piece of tuna covered over some greens and potato (yea  potato wth?) I think at first  it took a little getting used to but I ended up loving it. The Lamb Ribs were delicious  freakin' melt-in-your-mouth good kind of deal.   For entrees we got the Chicken Waldorf Salad and the Spaghetti. Boyfriend said the salad was good even though it just looked like a huge chunk of lettuce and my spaghetti was okay; very light. I don't think I fully enjoyed it because I was so full from the appetizers (btw  the portions here are pretty damn big haha)  The service was great; very friendly and prompt. All the waiters sported orange shirts that matched the color of the chairs so it was a little bit of overload but oh well.  Overall  good place for lunch. Maybe even for dinner  but I'll need to try that out the next time I'm here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When the girls and I are in Vegas  this is our go-to spot for various reasons.  Tradition  yummy food  best view of the Bellagio fountains on the patio  and service!  First  the bread basket w/ olives and olive tapenade is sooooo good! The foccacia  the little round kind of sweet  walnut bread is divine!  The dishes that I would recommend getting is the Beef Carpaccio (seriously the best carpaccio on earth! Choice cuts of meat  freshly shaved parm and a balsamic reduction..ugh to die for!).  You need to get the Grilled Squid and Octopus...the sauce alone with the chickpeas  roasted garlic is amazing especially when sopping it up with some foccacia!  The squid and octopus is super tender and flavorful.  I would seriously be happy splitting those two dishes with a friend.  Even though they are appetizers  the portions are large and could really be an entree.  I wasn't a big fan of the Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread...I thought the Gorgonzola was a bit much and overpowered the other flavors.  I could not really taste the fig...fresh figs would have been yummy on it.  The service is impeccable.  We always make reservations for one of Paul's tables!  He is the best waiter hands-down!!  Definitely make reservations ahead of time to be able to sit on the patio so you can watch the lovely Bellagio fountains!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was invited to lunch with a small group for a business meeting.  We only had about an hour  but the waiter did a great job of getting us out timely. The restaurant is busy  but it does not seem frenetic.  We were served our drinks  and they brought a large basket of breads and crackers  along with some spreads.  They were very tasty while we waited on our food.  We had a selection of sandwiches and pasta - my pasta was the ravioli with vegetables in a creamy sauce - I have to tell you that it was excellent!   This was my first visit to a Todd English restaurant  but I would definitely go again
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant was recommended to us because we were staying at the Bellagio. The tables are a little squished together  but some tables have a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Ask for one of these tables!     My steak had good flavor  but it was then and a little tough even though it was cooked medium. Eh! Disappointing for a $57 steak! My friend's seafood risotto was totally bland. I was shocked because it looked so good! The drinks are good but I wouldn't pay almost $20 for a martini again.    Overall  nice view  decent atmosphere  but waaayyyy too expensive for the quality of food. There are MANY places in Las Vegas that have amazing steaks at FAR better prices.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you want a little bit of a different type of menu  with a younger sexy crowd  check this place out. I like coming here for just drinks and appetizers with friends.   They serve special cocktails ie Fresh Pomegranate and Blueberry Martinis.   Great Appetizers:  -Beef Carpaccio  -Calamari  -Boston Bibb Salad  -Portobello Flatbread   Fav Entrees:  -Pork Medallions  -Duck   Best Drink: -Blueberry Martini  They don't get the fifth star ONLY because if you said we were going here for dinner  I wouldn't Oh Girlfriend you.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Man  I have been here a few times and each time I realize how great it is.  Loved our server  Rick.    It is awesome to sit outside  but don't be attached as there are not that many tables there.  If you get too freaky about that part  it is too bad.  The food is great  the service  love it.  I think it is wasted on some tourists because of the way most Americans eat  isn't that a bitchy thing to say?  But if you live in a city with really great chefs  you should make a reservation here.  A lot of food in Vegas is like a higher end ""Olive Garden"".   This place is my favorite."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great starter   octopuss with squids grilled I ordered the sword fish   kind disappointed  Was too butter taste like. Wine was good Too expensive though   I understand the mark up but this was a bit too much. My wife and I usually stay at the Wynn  And we dine out at bartolotta ristorante Di mare. Very expensive but worth every penny's
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Don't come here for a fine dining experience.  The atmosphere is loud.  You have to yell at your dinner companions.  For the price this is not what you want unless you want loud.  Small details missing in service.   Inconsistencies in the food   under salted.  Nothing exceptional.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Went there in August (the 12th to be exact) for a friends birthday dinner. I liked the decor & ambiance of the place... but that was pretty much all that I was impressed by. My friend picked it because she has a little obsession with the Bellagio water show & she hoped to be able to watch it while we dined. When she called she requested the patio. She was told they don't take reservations for outside  but if we got there early we could request to be sat out there instead of inside. When we got there however  we were told it'd be ""a long time before a party of 9 could be sat out there"". Wish they would have said this on the phone.   We also had this oddball waiter who seemed unable to hear very well & acted quite distracted. When I ordered the Caesar salad  he asked if I wanted chicken on it. I asked how much that would be (as their prices are a bit steep) and he said ""$12"". Well  the salad itself is $12 so I was a bit confused. After a ""Who's on first"" back & forth bit  I finally figured out he was saying that adding chicken to the salad is $12... EXTRA!  $24 for a small chicken Caesar salad? Are you kidding me?! Don't get me wrong  when the salad finally came (sans chicken) it was small (two strips of lettuce you have to chop up yourself with the parmigiana sprinkled on top) but VERY good. I still fail to see how they can charge $24 for it when they add chicken... unless of course the chicken himself ends up helping you get into a club of your choice later on that night!   Another friend ordered the ricotta ravioli & we decided to split our meals so I had some of that as well. It was definitely NOTHING special. In fact  there was far more sauce than there was ravioli! The ravioli that was there  was all stuck together. Very weird.   And so  my opinion of Olives is... I will go back if someone else is paying but never by my own choice. Sorry Todd English... take a cue from Bobby Flay. There's a reason why you were just a guest on ICA and he IS an Iron Chef ;)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Omg omg this place was awful unbelievable . We sat outside and we were hoping to get nice view to watch the fountain and we got nice table too but as soon as fountain start to begin omg all the adults  and kids are running outside to watch it and u can't even enjoy your food and I was in shock even the parents didn't mention anything to their children or staff should be very concern about this we didn't enjoy food and we couldn't even enjoy the view to many adults  and children were running out side. Food was horrible no taste at all steak and salmon was so so bad and we were so disappointed by this place and I can't even give this place 1star .
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food  service and ambiance! Hottie and I like to find the top spots to eat  whenever we're on vacation... I have to say it was fantastic  but with all the options in Vegas  it may take a few more trips before we go back.  That being said  let's get to the meal.  We started off with a chopped greek style salad  it was better than  your traditional greek salad  but not particularly memorable.  My dinner on the other hand was fantastic! Homemade butternut squash tortellini  you could tell the pasta was made to order because it was a little organic and uneven... but I loved it!  Unfortunately Hottie's $50 Steak looked like they picked it up from the local grocery store for $5  very disappointing.  For dessert we had the chocolate fallen cake with ice cream.  I'm spacing on the flavor of the ice cream  but I remember it being particularly delicious! Overall we left fat and happy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Good service  OK food but bad sommelier picks.    For $75 bucks a head you would think the food would be memorable and the wine pairings would be spot on.... not so much at Olives.  Our party of 5 all got the 3 course tasting menu with wine pairings.   The starter course was OK- nothing special.  Some of us had the garspacho and others the crab sticks- both were OK.  Wine was just OK.  Main course was King salmon or airline chicken or flank steak.  All 3 were disapointing.  The salmon was overcooked and flavorless and was served with some mushy risotto that had an overly generous seasoning of lemon preserves (I grew up eating wild salmon and was very bummed)  the steak was your average cut of meat the surprise was the airline chicken- which was a chicken breast and dark sauce.  Chicken was tender and flavorful- but come on.... $50 and only the chicken was good?   The big deal breaker of the evening came with the wine pairing- a run-of-the-mill pinot that was comparable to some two-buck-chuck.  Being from the Bay area.... we know wine  and this was not a good one.  The sommelier noticed we werent drinking the red and asked why.  We explained our displeasure and she graciously brought a small sample of a malbec instead.  It was appreciated.   The STAR of the evening was the dessert and the sweet dessert sparkling wine.  DELISH!  Icecream or lemon cake.... both were amazing and the sparkling wine was am amazing complement.   All in all  it was a good meal- but not amazing by any standards.  When I pay that much for dinner (and when I am in a city of cullinary greats) I expect the resturant to bring their ""A"" game.  Olives brought a solid ""C"" game.... and for that I wont be returning."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Spur of the moment decision to eat lunch here and it proved to be a good choice. The menu is not huge but everyone can find something enjoyable. The watermelon salad with feta  tomatoes and balsamic was crisp and cold-just the right choice in a hot day. The fig and prosciutto flatbread is large and delicious. The butternut squash ravioli is light and a nice entree and the Olives burger was well cooked with Carmelized onions and crispy fries. The only reason for the 4 star is while the service is good it was very slow. Nice cocktail list
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I alwsys enjoy dining at Olives if i'm staying at the Bellagio.  Excellent views  excellent food  and great service.  What more can one want?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I enjoyed a great lunch and trust me you will too. I was dining alone and chose to sit on the veranda to enjoy the great Vegas weather. If you don't mind waiting it was worth it. A very lovely view. I had the octopus and chick pea salad. It was wonderful!  The octopus was grilled to perfection and the broth with the chick peas was outstanding. There was no lettuce in this salad which is fine with me. My server was very nice and accommodating. I plan on going back again before I leave!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,25 minute wait despite a reservation for 2. Passed 4 empty tables on the way to ours. Hostess was condescending about the wait time.   We were promptly attended to by the wait staff   then had to wait 10 min before we saw anyone again. My water sat empty for over 5 minutes. As the meal progressed   the service improved.   The food was excellent as I've come to expect from Olives. The carpaccio was excellent. I wish the early impression and the delay in seating hadn't left such a bad taste in my mouth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Man this place was great for lunch.   The butternut squash tortelli was hands down the best butternut squash pasta type dish I have ever had. It was covered in a browned butter and nutmeg sauce which perfectly balanced the sweetness of the butternut squash center. I hate taking pictures of my food but I'm glad my friends took a picture of it because I swear the tortelli lasted about 3 minutes before I destroyed it and tucked it away forever as my own little secret love prisoner.   They infuse their vodka with pineapple and blueberries (not together). I've never seen so many empty martini glasses at a single table. I'm sure my group took care of their supply of pineapple and blueberry infused alcohol for the day.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I came here a couple weeks ago when I was in Vegas for my friend's bachelorette party. We hadn't made reservations for our Sunday night dinner  so we called that afternoon to see if they could squeeze a group of 8 of us in. We couldn't get in until 10  but that was fine  we were just happy to get reservations. We requested a table by the window  and we were so happy they were able to accommodate us. It was so pleasant getting to see the beautiful fountain show every 15 minutes from our table.  As for the food  everything was delicious. When we sat down we mentioned that we were starving  so they very promptly dropped off a couple baskets of amazing bread and olive spreads. Most of us ordered the scallops  which were insanely good. I also had the tuna tartare as an appetizer  which I loved. Our service was excellent  and I liked that our server didn't add auto gratuity to our check just because he can since we're a large party. We ended up tipping him well anyway though!  Overall  it's slightly expensive  but considering that it's in the top hotel on the strip  has a view of the fountains and has excellent food  I think it's worth the price
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My boyfriend and I stumbled across this place after seeing the generally positive Yelp reviews. Unfortunately we did not have a reservation  so we decided to ask the hostess when was the best time to walk-in. The hostess was extremely rude and unhelpful; completely turned me off. Basically kept repeating ""uh  you NEED a reservation or else you won't get in"". Okay lady  thanks?   Way to make your ""guests"" feel unwelcome. Unacceptable."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"One of the best culinary experiences I've ever had. Upon arrival you are served delicious bread basket with a variety of breads and green and black olive tapanades as well as marinated olives. The breads were awesome and there was a roll that was nutty and a perfect compliment to the olives. After reading other reviews on here we started off with the carpaccio. I was not sure about this. I don't do raw meat or fish but  I was on vacation so I was going to be daring. Wow! This inspired me to take more chances. So delicious and hard to describe. It was topped with a creamy roquefort crema sauce and shaved parmesan. One of the best most interesting things I've ever eaten. The flavors combined perfectly and each bite practically melted in your mouth. Again  wow! For my entree I had the Butternut Squash Tortelli with brown butter  sage  parmesan cheese. Although it was a little on the sweet side it was very good but way too much after the appetizer. My husband had the Grilled Venison Bloc with crispy fried portobello cap  garlicky spinach  bacon polenta  rosemary grissini  black currant glaze. Right away he said the glaze tasted like ""mole sauce"" which is a Mexican chocolate sauce. I was alarmed since he hates mole. Well he definitely didn't hate this dish. He said the ingredients combined perfectly and the spinach was a perfect compliment to the glaze. He really liked it. i was shocked. The wine was also spectacular. I had a Riesling that was one of the best I've ever tasted.  I want to call and get the name of the wine  it was perfect! We didn't have room for desert unfortunately. The service was just excellent. We sat outside and had a beautiful view of the water show at the Bellagio. Super romantic. I made reservations and asked to be seated outside and I'm glad I did because the restaurant was packed.I loved having dinner here and will definitely be back!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Yay!!! A great way to experience the Bellagio.   The experience was impeccable  with a profession waitstaff that flowed well together seamlessly.   The food was divine  starting right with the bread and spreads. (Oh  bring on those carbs.!!!) The Fig and Prosciutto was spot on. Two of us were bought and sold with the Tuna tartar. This is a dish that can be so insipid in the wrong hands. Here  is is treated like the jewel of a plate that is should be. Bravo.  Next time we will ask for a patio spot to watch the fountains. It was a bit nippy (for this south Florida girl) so the inside was the right choice this night.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I decided to take a different route for my birthday (September 2011) - have a relaxing day with no plans. That led me to wanting lunch at OLiVES. My fiance and I walked up to the hostess and requested a table for two. She told us the wait would be an hour since we didn't have reservations and ended it with an apathetic ""sorry "" but also suggested the bar. I walked away hurt and annoyed  then came to the realization that the bar may be fine. We luckily found two seats toward the end of the bar near the patio (what a fantastic view!) and decided to go with it. Shaky start with no bartender really paying us any attention  however one finally comes over and apologizes for the wait and is more than happy to get us everything we need.  I began with a White Cosmo - delicious - and calamari. The portion was extremely generous  fresh squid  the batter was crisp and light with a balancing spicy marinara and creamy jalapeno aioli (could have been spicier but very tasty nonetheless)  very yummy. Definitely a top five calamari dish. From their Restaurant Week menu  I chose the Wild Mushroom Tart with herbed goat cheese  caramelized red onions  black truffle essence and parsley butter. It was tasty with just a kick of truffle flavor  however it seemed burnt and the mushrooms had no body left to it - just crisp  dry pieces thrown on top.  For entrees  I had the Skirt Steak Frites with spicy broccoli rabe  vidalia onion marmalade  watercress  lemon vinaigrette and OLiVES fries - steak prepared medium rare and done to my liking; the marmalade marinade was good although not my favorite steak dressing; the fries were crispy potato wedges with seasoning and just okay. My boyfriend got the Ricotta Ravioli with roasted tomato basil sauce and sweet Italian sausage - very yummy! The ricotta filling was fantastic and the sauce was balanced  tasty and well-bodied.  We shared the Vanilla Semifreddo for dessert that featured a marble cake (surprisingly light  but unimpressive)  the semifreddo (fresh  light and a nice richness) and fresh strawberries. Great presentation. Not a dessert I would order again though. After our meal  we sampled additional cocktails like one with muddled blackberries  mint  vodka  sour and a little soda. All very delicious! The veteran bartenders definitely know what they're doing and have a few tricks up their sleeves. Their housemade fresh fruit infused vodkas are a must try! We sampled the batch made with Madagascar vanilla beans  strawberries and blueberries - WOW. So flavorful and great just by itself.  After making friends with the other patrons of the bar (whom were all also enjoying themselves very much)  we ended up staying there for almost FOUR HOURS! We had such a great time with the bartenders and other diners! Based on that alone  I am definitely making my way back there and I'm not sitting anywhere but the bar - great food to munch on during the afternoon and delicious house-crafted cocktails (every drink on their specialty menu was created by a bartender on their staff with the exception of two classics). To think I was going to walk away? Best birthday lunch  EVER."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went here for my bachelorette party and it was delicious..I think we devoured the bread in 3 minutes. Service was great with a great view. Food came out fast  presentation was delicious and everyone loved their meal. Their appetizers were the best!  Price seems ok for such a nice restaurant. Make sure to make reservations because there was a long line outside.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Loved their bread basket with an assortment of bread and different types of olive tapenade..  They even brought us a second round of tapenade without fuss.  I had the Brick Oven Roasted Free Range Chicken. It was a huge dish  I couldn't finish it all and I was already feeling full from the bread basket....The chicken was pretty good  dry here and there but for the most part it was good. Potato cake and green beans were delicious...I actually can't even remember there being any roasted red onion or watercress  I probably just overlooked it....  We did order a wine from the menu that was 2009 and they ended up bringing out a 2010  I definitely wouldn't have noticed  but my friend did and they ended up telling us that they didn't have any more 2009 in the wine we picked  so be careful to watch out for that  tricky.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I made a reservation for this place because i heard it was really fantastic.  Maybe there was too much hype.   i have to admit the restaurant has a nice woody decor and is right next to the bellagio fountains and there is a nice view  but i dont think the food was that great. It was rather ordinary and the pasta was rather bland and unexceptional.  the chestnut ravioli was too dry and sticky. i thought it was too crowded in table space as well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I dropped by here hoping to get a table outside  by the fountains. Sadly  that wasn't in the cards. I settled for an indoor seat by the window  and ordered the Watermelon Salad followed by Scallops and Prosciutto.   As I waited for my meal  I gazed at the then-inactive fountains of the Bellagio.   When my appetizer finally came out  it was quite good  a nice combination of flavors from the watermelon and feta. More than anything  the salad got me ready for the main course.   As I waited for my entree  I gazed at a family that came in  ordered  and started on their meal. They got about two-thirds of the way through their lunch before my dish finally came out (over ten minutes after my server said my food would be out in a moment). The wait was worthwhile. The scallops were juicy  but not rubbery  flavorful  but not burnt. The bedding of rice was admittedly a tad bitter  and the sprouts sprinkled all over the dish made little sense  but  overall  the meal blew my doors off. So did the check. The server  when she finally returned  with my check  overcharged me by almost double. Thanks.  Everyone has a bad day  and I had a fantastic  if excessively lengthy  lunch. I'd still recommend this place in an instant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very delicious!! First time in Vegas for a conference and can't wonder to far from the hotel. Went to olives do lunch and was so happy!!! Quick service  delicious food and not too pricey. Had the beef carpaccio based on previous reviews for my entree and was perfect amount!!! Thanks all!! Definitley will be back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Absolutely amazing! I have not been anywhere that had great service  great food and an amazing view! All thanks to Paul Anthony he was the best. Knew exactly what we wanted  surprised us and the most important gave the best customer service! If you are in town you definitely need to stop here !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Delicious food! my husband had the burger with Truffle cheese and absolutely loved it. I had the buccatini and meatballs which was delicous.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Order the fig flat bread! Also enjoyed the scallops.  I don't know if there's a more enjoyable   consistent place to dine in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Post tripling my bet at Roulette boyfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to dinner at Todd English's Olives.  Yes  the name is part of the title of the restaurant  that's how you know where to eat when you're in Vegas.  Mina has like five (including a Nobhill gastro-pub).  Our seats were amazing  because we sat on the outdoor marbled terrace  looking out onto the strip across the Bellagio fountains.  The fountain show ranges from ""My heart will go on"" to ""Big Spender""  its pretty entertaining.  It's all pretty over the top  they give you 2 napkins (?!) for some reason  and pour your order of a glass of wine from its own little beaker.  We dined on grilled calamari and chick pea dressing  which was delicious  probably the best chickpeas I've had in a long time  and an enormous portion.  As were the entrees  a ""bloc"" of venison and the brick oven roasted chicken.  I love restaurant roasted chickens  I might even have a problem with it  because it keeps me from ordering other things.  What I mean to say  was that this was a pretty good one  and I would know too.   I could only eat half though  and felt terrible about wasting food in the middle of such a barren desert.  The venison bloc came atop a block of polenta  and an entire roasted portabello mushroom stuffed with blue cheese.  Tasty  but also  how you say  a little much (learn to edit your accessories...)  In all a totally great  what you call  dining experience.  Service was efficient  waiter a bit shaking with wine knowledge  but now I'm just being picky."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I recently had an opportunity to dine there. Our party ordered the following:  Beef Cappacio - it is very flavorful and a very popular item on the menu for the last 18 years (per our very sweet and attentive waitress)  Chilean Sea Bass - the fish is so tender inside and it maintains the natural flavor  accompanied by fava beans plus tomato saffron nage. Very memorable and highly recommended!   North Atlantic Sea Scallops - my friend did not quite enjoy this dish as the scallops are too salty and the risotto is lukewarm. The waitress apologized profusely and sent the dish back to the kitchen. After several minutes  she brought it back. The scallops are still too salty  but my friend finished it nonetheless.  Did I mention the complimentary bread basket plus green olive tapenade with some whole olives in between are so yummy?     Unfortunately  despite the fact that I requested a patio table when making the reservation  this request cannot be honored ""due to circumstances beyond our control"" according to the hostess. Furthermore  we had to wait a bit to be seated even when we arrived on time. I may come back in the future for special occasions  but I am hesitant to recommend this place to others."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Horrible service from beginning to end.  We had a reservation at 9:30 on 6/13.  We arrived 5 min early  and was told it'll be a few minute wait.  That was totally fine  until 20 minutes passed and none of the hosts gave us updates on what was happening.  One word of acknowledgement would have gone a long way.   We also requested the patio seating  but was told it was raining and they were no longer seating people outside.  Because we had so much time to kill waiting despite the reservation  my husband actually went to the patio to check out if it was raining.  There was no rain and people were sitting there.  Even though I had left a note in our reservation that we wanted to sit outside and told them at the counter that we wanted to sit by the patio/windows  no efforts were made  and they just sat us farthest away from the patio.  Clearly  they don't give an S about making customers happy.       At this point  we were bummed but tried to be positive.  We were on vacation after all.  Our positive attitude was crushed soon after by their RUDE waiter who poured my wine so roughly it almost spilled onto my clothes.  His rudeness continued throughout  and he overcharged us in the end to top it off.    I would give ONE BIG MIDDLE FINGER for this place.  The food was good but so many other places in Vegas offer good food.  Olive is lame.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We dined at Olives last night a party of 6 and I was expecting a great meal. Food service was really slow and the food was marginal at best. I ordered the sirloin steak med rare it came well done. It was replaced and cooked better the second time but still was not very good - funky preparation. Too many good place in Vegas to eat  this is not one of them!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"One star is for the awesome bread they serve you after you order.    Where do I start? Our cocktails were horrible; we ordered Sangria  and I swear it was something a kid breaking into his parents liquor cabinet would make: horrible. I didn't even bother finishing mine.  The food: my husband ordered the Alaskan Salmon  I ordered the pasta special for the night. BOTH of these were horrible. The food was SO salty that you couldn't taste ANY flavor except salt. Our food came out TOO quick  that it leaves me wondering if maybe certain items are plated in advanced?   Our Server would be better suited at a lower class establishment. He bombarded us as soon as we sat down; we had no chance to even look over our menus. When we didn't order cocktails straight away  we didn't see him again for ten minutes.  He didn't even bother explaining the specials at all  and yes there is an insert inside the menu  but you would think at least he would do some kind of introduction into the specials. Our food arrived  and our server would pop up now and then to say things like  ""Taste good?"" or ""How's the taste?"" It was strange. He was plain crass  and he didn't seem to really care much about our experience at all.  You think for menu items costing in the range of $26 all the way up to $54 a plate  that you would get stellar service; sadly this is NOT the case.  The worst part was the bill: $131.00 for food that I could've gotten at the Olive Garden. I was so burned when we left this place. I was totally shocked when I came here and read that it was getting 4 star reviews! Do not go here. Stay as far away as you can.    Good things: Our waters were always refilled. The bread basket was delish. The restaurant has got some killer decor."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had lunch at Olives after a friends recommendation. DELICIOUS!! We started with the Beef Carpaccio and continued with the Shrimp Fettuccine which was light and tasty  perfect for lunch on a warm day on the patio. We had a lengthy conversation with the General Manager  Valentin.  He was very helpful and friendly. Quick service  amazing food  a view of the Bellagio water show  what else can you ask for!!! Don't miss this one!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,i'm so glad i decided to eat here; everything i had was incredible!!!  the bread is delicious. the duck salad was awesome. the trout was flavorful (my boyfriend had the sirloin and it was even better than my trout  if that was even possible).  we had a view of the bellagio fountains  which was a plus. oh! and i had the best cosmopolitan of my life. both rounds were perfect with bits of shaved ice inside...wow!  i recommend this place to bellagio visitors. price is on the hefty side  but you get what you pay for- quality.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The only reason I gave this restaurant 2 stars is for the Beef Carpaccio. I moved 2500 miles earlier this year and my sister and I did our annual Vegas trip right before. I had  been searching for the best beef carpaccio in the city and supposedly  Olives had it.   When we stopped by we found out after inquiring that restaurant hadn't opened yet. When we expressed interest in dining when it did open  no one informed us that there were no reservations and standing in line would be the best thing to insure a patio table (we had made it clear we were hungry and desired to sit outside by the fountains to see the show). Therefore  when we came back  there was a very long line. I wasn't happy and neither was my sister. When I went to speak to the front of house team  they didn't seem at all concerned that they had dropped the ball. I would say that my casual clothing put them off  but first  that shouldn't make a difference. Second  if they are going to do that  they should have been able to discern that although I was dressed casually  I was wearing about $10k in clothing  my clutch  shoes and jewelry.   So we are put onto the patio and things just went downhill from there. Although there were available tables in front right next to the water  we were given the ""bad"" table  the one right by the server station. The table next to us asked why if there were no reservations why they weren't sat up in the front and were given a BS answer (that the tables were reserved). Considering that they were a nicely dressed young couple  you have to wonder who you have be to be given a good table here. We were ignored for quite a while  even after placing our menus closed in front of us. Once our server did show  he treated us like kids at Christmas who snuck over to the adults' table a year before being called up. I dine at places like this or better on a consistent basis. My choice of casual wear on a long weekend with my sister doesn't change my speech  manners or decorum. None of the high end stores we shopped in while waiting for them to open had an issue with the way we were dressed. If we weren't so hungry  we would have left. I treat everyone no matter what their capacity with dignity and respect. However  being spoken to like we didn't belong by our server was rather disconcerting.   Our food finally arrived and I don't recall what my sister ordered (I'll have to ask her)  but I recall that she said it was ok. My beef carpaccio was outstanding. Which makes the experience that much more disappointing.   Midway through our meal  the other tables that were empty started to fill. It was clear that the servers knew a table of elderly people that they placed next to the water. My sister and I had never been there before and after this experience  most likely never will again. Before anyone says that they must of had a reservation  it states on the Bellagio website they don't take reservations for the patio (in fact  when we came back  she again informed me that they don't take reservations).  We wanted dessert  but frankly I wasn't about to spend another dollar in a place that had gone out of its way to treat us the way they had. I shouldn't have to walk around flashing my boyfriend's black card or have him make a call for people to treat us well. It wasn't a birthday  anniversary  etc. we were celebrating  but my sister and I weren't going to see one another for a long time and this was time spent together before my move. We didn't allow it to ruin the rest of our day because we aren't like that  but given that it's a restaurant in the Bellagio  if you can't get even acceptable service here  where can you? My birthday is next month and we are doing our 2015 trip then. I am considering staying at the Bellagio. But the way we were treated at one of its restaurant gives me multiple reasons  to rethink that."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My experience with Olives restaurant overall is by far the worst upscale dining experience in Vegas yet...  Had a server by the name of Joel L. We ordered a bottle of Veuve Champagne which I do understand it wasn't the most expensive. However this server NEVER once came to pour the champagne. As a matter of fact we only saw our server less than a few times and once was to bring our food  about 45min after ordering. He never came to check on us  only to try and sell us dessert which of course we bought.   As for the food: I had the seafood risotto. Very average  I don't recommend it. The dessert the server recommended a coconut cake  was rock hard... Should've been sold as a cookie.   To top things off  I left a vape mod (E-Cigarette Module) at the table. I called the restaurant multiple times since I left and the manager finally calls back a day later stating his server did not take it has he worked there forever. Well  I never accused him  or anyone at that. Other than his service sucked beyond belief.   I opened a investigation with Bellagio security. I'm sure there's cameras here and I hope that Bellagio does the right thing and finds out what really happened. The vape mod is not something that is easily thrown away or over looked as it is bigger than a cell phone and substantially heavy for what it is.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hands down  one of the best dining experiences in Las Vegas. The food  staff and atmosphere are in no way pretentious. Everything about this place welcomes you as a special guest. I had the beef carpaccio and butternut squash tortelli. Both are large portions. The other diners had the beef tartare--so much that he had to stop eating!! On top of great food and service  you get a fabulous show in the fountains. It makes for a very special evening!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Damn  I was actually impressed!  For some reason  I was expecting to be under-whelmed... no idea why  but just was.  Obviously everything is Vegas is touristy...but I figured with the beautiful views of the fountains and all the food could be ho-hum and people would still flock to it.  I'm pleased to report this was not the case.  Everything I had was great  and I would highly recommend this restaurant.  The basket of bread and the olive tapenade were excellent... not your standard rolls and butter.  As far as cocktails  they made the perfect martini (which has been elsusive to me for this trip thus far).  So cheers to the bartender here who got it right!  The rest of the review might be skewed though... and I was 3 martinis in by the time the entree hit :-)  The tuna app was perfect all around.  The ribeye was actually one of the most flavorful I have had.  It was a touch over medium for my taste  but it was fairly thin so harder to tell medium.  The balsamic glaze was perfect with it as well.  For desert  I had the chocolate cake with the hot chocolate center (forget the name... still a big hung over).  It was alright... it would be a skip next time.  The coffee was good though  so that made up some points for dessert!  Overall  I would say this is a great place for a quiet evening.  The service is top notch and attentive  the location and views are spectacular  and the food is very good!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing food with an equally amazing view. We ate on the patio and got to see the Bellagio water show about 5 time. Although it was Christmas  the nice heaters allowed for a pleasant meal. We had the chestnut soup to start along with the great variety of bread and olives. Although it didn't look all that appetizing the flavor was spectacular. It was so creamy and thick and delicious. We also had the osso buco pasta with a nice tomato sauce and a pasta with butternut squash and brown butter sage sauce. Both of these dishes were fabulous  full of flavor and great texture. Our waiter provided great service and even took multiple pictures of us with the Bellagio fountain in the background. He wanted to make sure we got the perfect shot! Definitely one of the top restaurants in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have to give Olives a 5 star review for the amazing service and view we had at dinner.  We had reservations at 7 on a Tuesday for 5 people. We showed up at 6pm had drinks at the bar and asked for a table outside and that we were willing to wait for it.  We had the perfect table outside and were seated right at 7pm. The service was top notch and everyones meal was very good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My husband made a reservation for 2 at 7:15pm on a Wednesday night. As you have read from prior reviews  you cannot reserve patio seating ahead of time. We arrived at 7:15pm to be told to return two hours later for patio seating. OK...I was expecting that. Luckily we were staying at the Bellagio and we weren't that hungry anyway so we went back to our room to relax and returned at 9pm.   When we returned we waited another 10-15 minutes before being seated on the patio. We were actually seated all the way in the back by the door and had an obstructed view of the fountains due to the other tables and the umbrellas. NOT HAPPY! I can't believe we waited two hours for that. The service was extremely slow at the beginning. After 25 minutes  our waiter's assistant finally brought us water. Another 15 minutes later and our waiter finally takes our order.  My husband had the Ribeye steak and I had the chicken and artichoke flatbread. The food was very good!! We also ordered the dessert as well! (I forgot what it was  but it was very good!) Our waiter never asked if we were here for a special occasion but I casually said it was my birthday when he passed me the dessert menu and then brought me another dessert that said ""Happy Birthday"" on it! Very cute!   We were also approached by a lovely woman who took our picture! The pictures turned out great! We bought the large collage of pictures.                         This place is expensive. Our bill was easily $120 without alcohol. Be prepared for a hefty bill! All in all  there are so many other places on the strip with great views that won't make you wait over 2 hours for a terrible view. We will go somewhere else next time."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Being a local  I know that restaurants on the Strip are overpriced to begin with. However  I expect the extra cost to be made up in food quality and service. My wife had a lamb chop and me  a sirloin steak. Both were $40+ entrees. They were good  but I expected more  like great. I also had a bowl of potato soup  $16  that was delicious but done after 5 spoonfuls. Our server was outstanding. A view of the fountains is special  but means more to the tourist crowd. We had tried to get into Prime Steakhouse  but the wait was more than 2 hours.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,No better flatbread and infused Vodka on the planet.  There other items are also amazing.  We just continue going back to sit at the bar with great bar tenders and amazing service at the bar.  Just a fun and bright place in LV.  We go back there for late lunch or dinner almost everytime we are there...   Always fun  and always great service.  You really should have reservations for dinner - otherwise you will have a long wait.  However  the bar is greatness.  Enjoy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've eaten here before and love it. This time I had dinner there with four colleagues. It was a bit of a wait but it was worth it. Service was impeccable.we had the beef capriccio  Chacruterie board  tomato flatbread and froie gras for appetizer which were all excellent.  The ambiance is very nice but they need to do something about the glare that comes into the restaurant due to the Gucci (?) store across the hall in the mall. It has a white sign with lights which are frankly blinding. If further into the restaurant or out side your fine but sitting close to the front of the place could be a problem.   For dinner I had the butternut squash ravioli  Chilean sea bass  Atlantic salmon  steak and scallops which were all on point. We were very pleased and can't wait to comeback here again. I'm in Vegas in business a couple of times a year and definitely see Olives as one of the best in a town with some great restaurants.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the biggest disappointments of my 40th birthday weekend in Vegas.  Yes  the patio and fountain show are great and fun.  But it's soo expensive to have mediocre food and terrible service.  Not only was the wait staff terrible  but the hostess was annoying and full of herself.  Hey  I didn't make her become a hostess!?  Wouldn't recommend and I'm shocked to read the positive reviews!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is terrific. Patio  fountain seating is limited   so get there early and call to reserve.  Ask for closest to the fountain seats. If you like rare the steak tartar and tuna tartar are fabulous.  They take food alergias seriously   just ask and even the bread selection will be accomodated. by far the tastiest   most tender pork chop I've had.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Probably the most consistently good restaurant on the strip. It's got everything: Great fresh food (at a reasonable price)  good service  amazingly good bloody marys (and I usually hate bloody marys)  and hands down the best outdoor patio in Vegas (it overlooks Bellagio's fountain lake).  There are  no real negatives to this place except that the patio only seats about 15 tables. Also  we only go for lunch. As far as dinner service and fare goes  we are clueless. Todd English gets it right everytime for us though...no wonder he beat the Iron Chef.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,there is nothing worse than a bad hostess specially in Las Vegas where you get spoiled with the good service everywhere. my wife and I were planning on celebrating our 1 yr old daughter birthday at the Belagio fountains . we made a reservation at olives  6 pm knowing that we might have to wait to sit outside since we were told  we can't request it(weird but not my business). we arrived on time and I immediately checked the patio and found  couple tables available  with no one waiting so I asked to be seated on one of them.   the answer was no and I have to wait 2-3 hours to sit outside .when  I inquired about the two available tables  she told me they were reserved . after a short argument she failed to explain how they could when i couldn't and there you go she turned extremely rude to exit from the situation  .totally unprofessional  I canceled the reservation and filed a complain with hotel management(still did not hear from them). hope  I am an isolated experience .but still this is how I rate them.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have to admit that I was disappointed in the food Olives. Service was great and they were very understanding when we were an hour late for our reservation (we called twice).   I really liked the bread they serve in the beginning with the olive tapenade. The warm walnut bread with honey was AMAZING and we even requested more.  Started the meal with the beet salad and crab beignets and it was just meh. Really didn't have any flavor and wasn't impressed. The crab beignets also were like deep fried crab cakes and not beignets. It didn't do much for me in terms of flavor or taste.  The main dishes were the portabello mushrooms flatbread and the salmon trio. The flatbread was probably the best thing we ate (except the warm walnut bread rolls...drool...) and you could taste the truffle oil on it too. If you're going to eat there  I'd highly recommend that you order a flat bread.  The salmon trio was a seared salmon  salmon cake  and salmon tabouli. The seared salmon wasn't anything special but i did appreciate they didn't overcook it. I thought the salmon cake was interesting and probably my favorite of the three. The tabouli wasn't memorable. Not worth $36.  Ended the meal with a vanilla souffle and taste-wise it was fine but the consistency was off. My expectations of a souffle at a Mediterranean restaurant were also not high.  Overall it was a pleasant atmosphere and our waitress was great. I just didn't think the food was really worth the prices and I would not go back again if I was in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was super excited about eating here! I have heard nothing but good things about this place...   My girlfriends and I went here for a fancy dinner and i knew the prices were going to be pricey  but I don't mind paying a lot as long as the food is worth it and good.  I got: -Beef carpaccio: This thing is huge and really good. It was actually my first time trying beef carpaccio so I don't really have anywhere else to compare to  but it was good! -Scallops: Our waiter recommended this dish so I got it. The scallops were very fishy smelling and tasting. So i did not like it too much.  I was not super wow'd by anything. I sampled all my gf's dishes and some were better than others. I am glad I tried this place though. We were seated at the table with an excellent view of the Bellagio water fountain thing and service was good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Booked through OpenTable.  They had our reservation when we got there but they were over booked and we waited 30 minutes for our table.  There were 4 of us and all ordered different things.  Beef tenderloin  cooked and seasoned perfectly at Medium Rare.  Surprisingly spicy sausage & ricotta ravioli.  Gnocci with pulled chicken was a bit bland and was drizzled with balsamic vinegrette that didn't bring much to the party.  And Chilean Sea Bass which was also cooked perfectly but a bit light on the seasoning.  We also got a flat-bread appetizer and 6 drinks among us.  For the most part the food was a strong 3 or a weak 4.  We had a great time in spite of the issues which were: price $300  noise and lighting level (too dark  they have a cool back lighting device on the check folders so you can read the bill).    We will probably go back because it's so convenient with staying at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Meh. Long wait. Risotto undercooked  salmon OK. Lobster mac n cheese missing lobster  runny cheese. Failed to seat on patio as reserved. Gave table to another group. Enjoyed my post meal cheeseburger from In N Out. I hate pretentiousness.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This food is to die for. I come back every time I'm in Vegas. Everything from service  atmosphere  food  etc is the best of the best. Iv never been dissapointed and I would buy the tapenade by the gallon if I could. SO DELICIOUS! SO INCREDIBLE! 5 stars!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best thing about this place is the view of the fountain. That said  best to be on the patio or near the window. The flat breads were delicious. However the larger plates were all very average. The soft shell crab pasta was pretty bland and the steak sandwich a bit tough. Stick apps and drinks and enjoy the view.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Visited Olive's after seeing Cirque's O at the Bellagio (Fantastic show!)   It was about 9:30 on a Sunday night and quite packed...thankfully we had a reservation. While we did arrive a few minutes early  we were promptly seated.   I wasn't terribly hungry so I passed on a pre-dinner app and just ordered an app for dinner. My fellow diners  however  did opt for some apps one of which I did steal a few bites of  the Tuna Tartare. Very delish! Fresh diced tuna mixed with rock shrimp with a clean  but slightly spicy sesame dressing all atop a crisp  lightly dressed  julienned cucumber salad.  For my dinner I chose the Steamed Clams. Not completely what I had expected  but a nice dish nonetheless. A LARGE bowl of steamed clams tossed with a chunky tomato and garlic sauce. I was expecting a sauce more along the lines of a white wine/garlic or a garlic/butter sauce so the chunky tomato veggie sauce caught me off guard. (For the record- it did not say tomato sauce on the menu). The steamed clams were perfectly steamed  tender and served in abundance! I wasn't a huge fan of the sauce and found it to be a bit ""burdensome"" when trying to shell and eat the clams.   Service  was so-so. Our server was prompt and efficient  but definitely not the most friendly. He was a bit cold and you kind of got the feeling he didn't want to be there.   Everyone seemed to be pretty satisfied with their meals  but no one was raving about it either. Overall good meal  decent service  nice ambiance (we were sitting inside and had a nice view of the Bellagio water show).   When in the area  a return trip is doubtful but not out of the question. Too many other options and for the price I would expect service to be a bit more friendly."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,BEST vodka martinis anywhere. Between the Maytag blue cheese stuffed olives spiked in a sprig of rosemary and the perfect combination of ice cold vodka and vermouth  I was in heaven.  The bartenders are great and lots of fun.  We ate dinner at the bar. The fig and prosciutto flatbread is not to be missed. The ravioli was al dente with the right amount of sauce. I would return again in a heartbeat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I struggled with deciding a rating for this one. On one hand  the food was amazing  but on the other  this was some of the WORST service I have ever received.  I came here for a special dinner during my bachelorette party. The service I received from most of the staff was fine  but our waiter was seriously the rudest waiter I have ever encountered. The more I think about it  the angrier I get.   To start off  when I made the reservation they asked if we were celebrating a special occasion and I told them it was my bachelorette. At dinner I even had a ""Bride to Be"" sash on and not once did he acknowledge our special occasion  no congratulations  no nothing  whatever. Before taking our order he seemed dismissive to our table. He barely gave us any attention during the meal  and when he did  he was extremely rude and aggressive with us. I guess I would understand if we were being difficult  but I thought we were an extremely tame and polite table throughout the entire meal.   He seemed even more annoyed when we didn't order enough for him. We had a huge lunch so most of us weren't very hungry and ordered some less filling items. He repeatedly made comments about how little we were eating and if we were ready to finally order steak and lobster. It was extremely annoying and condescending. I understand it's important to waiters for their tables to order a lot  but even if we don't  that does not give you the right to treat us poorly.  As for the food  my sister and I ordered Tuna Tartare  Ricotta Ravioli  Sangria and Chocolate Cake  all the items were delicious.   At the end of the meal he gave us a ton of grief about splitting the check. My cousin who has worked as a waitress for years tried working with him to see which way to split the check would be the easiest. He basically yelled at her about how difficult the check was and blew her off. We then found out that his job was not even to ring us up  a cashier does that. On top of all the drama  all our cards were charged 2-3 times. I'm sure this will be resolved  but it was just icing on the cake for such a horrible service experience.   Seriously  this guy was straight up mean to us the entire meal. But  despite his horrid attitude  I still had a fantastic bachelorette weekend."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Happy New Years!!!!  Olives was currently one of the only restaurants offering a flexible menu until 730PM last night so my friend and I snatched up a reservation. Our menu was still modified but a lot more ""wallet friendly"" than your typical prefixed menus.   The restaurant is beautiful and I enjoyed the intimate atmosphere. Surprisingly not very crowded around out 7pm reservations time which was awesome!  What I Ordered:  *Portobello Flatbread- I'm not a mushroom fan but this flatbread was cheesy and delicious.   *Ricotta Ravoli (w/o Italian sausage) I'm very new to red sauce and this dish was a great introduction. I appreciated how nice and light the ravioli was and the sauce was soo good!   *Coconut Poundcake AMAZING!!!! The End   The server was delayed throughout the night and even gave me the bill before offering dessert or coffee which of course we ordered but it didn't affect my overall experience and I would consider and or recommend Olives in the near future."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our first meal when we got in to Vegas at the hotel we were staying at. It's a good size restaurant and it does get packed even on week nights!  We called to let them know that we were going to be a little late for our reservation and had to wait about 5 minutes to be seated when we got there.  The restaurant was quite dark inside. There were a few older couples there that were having a hard time looking at the menu. Our waiter was professional but not too talkative.  They have a full bar (duh!) and wine selection were great too.  We ordered an appetizer and a starter to share. Then an entree each. Oh my  the portions were huge!!!!  We were both very full before our entrees came. The food were all good  but we wished the waiter had said something  or maybe tell us that we had ordered way too much food. We could have fed 4-6 people with what we got!!  Seatings are great  if you are seated way inside you can see the Fountain Show clearly  or if you are seated by the entrance  you can people watch. Overall it was a very good meal  just remember that portions are triple X rated here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A great restaurant for contemporary decor and delicious food.  We arrived an hour before our reservation to get on the list for patio seating.  We wanted to be able to dine and enjoy the fountain show at the same time.  It was such a unique experience to be able to enjoy good food/wine while taking in the iconic Bellagio fountain show.  We started with the fig and prosciutto flat bread along with the squid and octopus.  Both were really good.  For entrees my wife and seafood risotto  and I had the grilled lamb chops.  My lamb chops were perfectly prepared to rare and were so tender.  We spent about 2 hours out there and did not feel rushed to leave as they were pretty busy.    We made our reserveation for 6:30 so we could enjoy twilight and the fountain show at night.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Killer cocktails flatbreads and other apps. Loved it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My coworkers raved about Olives and every time she hits Vegas she has to go there with her fiance.  I was sold so I went with my fiance  twice in one weekend.  The first time we didn't make it for lunch or for dinner and got stuck in between at their bar time around 3 pm.  We each got a cocktail  me a Bellini and fiance got a martini.  We shared a salad and the spicy chicken flat bread.  Both were ok but I really enjoyed talking to the bartender and hearing about his ties to San Francisco  (where we live).    We came back the following day for lunch and had a really nice server  again!  This time he got a beer and I got another delicious bellini.  We shared the ahi tuna tacos  and each got a burger.  I was full after the delicious complimentary bread but managed to power through most of the burger.  I would have preferred shoestring fries but I picked through that anyways since there was so much food.    An excellent choice for any meal of the day.  And the staff was amazing!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beautiful restaurant with amazing food.  The Boston Bibb salad is so simple but absolutely delicious.  Their flatbreads are great too.  I don't like TOO much cheese on my pizzas and these were great options for the picky pizza eater such as myself.  I definitely recommend this place for any romantic date that you still want a laid back vibe to.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Whenever I'm in Vegas I try to come here for Sunday brunch before heading back home.  Since I was in Vegas the whole week for a convention  I decided to drop by on the Monday after Valentines.  My go to dishes: beef carcpacio  bellini  chestnut ravioli (last season's menu)  clams.  On a nice day I recommend sitting out on the balcony  but you'll usually have to get there when they open at 11 to get outdoor seating to watch the noon fountains go off.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Gotta love it. Squid and octopus appetizer still a favorite.  The view of the fountain  decor and overall quality of all the dishes in top notch. A LV go to for me.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,BEEF CARPACCIO! BEEF CARPACCIO!  BEEF CARPACCIO!   I just got to put it out there for those that just skim through these yelp reviews. That is a MUST GET. Of course unless you dont eat raw beef or is a vegetarian. if you don't get it you are truly missing out. This thing is HUGE! If you are not up for sharing  this could be an entree. In this case  I would probably do just that on my next visit. The dressing and the beef and everything just harmonizes so well.   My mouth is watering just thinking of that thin layer of raw meat. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=aRyU8-mu9imUyGsh_X6hng#aRyU8-mu9imUyGsh_X6hng I swear  I am not a cannibal.   Moving along with the rest of the dishes...  Veal & Fontina Fazzoletti http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=aRyU8-mu9imUyGsh_X6hng#vu7X8-BE4xvU9HOBXSUF1A ...rosemary & burgundy braised veal breast  white truffle emulsion  crispy prosciutto with ravioli. Mmmhmm good  the veal was braised so nicely with such great flavors of truffle. Very soft and not hard and chewy at all.   My date got the set dinner menu of the night with the grilled salmon and the alaskan crab saladhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=aRyU8-mu9imUyGsh_X6hng#dEzj29fnC3Kj1CzKILRmLw I believe. Both were very delicious as well. the crab just screamed FRESH! and the salmon http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=aRyU8-mu9imUyGsh_X6hng#1m2kuqzMbxB96OFSKaA_xg was perfectly cooked.   now.. the next item to rave about is the... Seasonal fruit pineapple cocktail.  HOLY COW! I don't think a cocktail can possible get ANY better than this. The pineapple flavors just bursts through and gets topped with this delicious pineapple froth.  Lets just put it this way... we ordered 3 or 4 during dinner.. and before I left I just couldn't resist and asked if I could get another one for the road.   Dont worry though  this review isn't hyped up or anything just because I got cups after cups of the delicious pineapple drink.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My good friend decided to take me out for an early birthday lunch. i would rate this a 5 star but our waitress was nowhere to be found when we needed her. It took us a good 20 minutes to track down our waitress and we finally ordered  we've ordered our starter which was the chicken artichoke flat bread & the Fig Prosciutto flat bread  the both were very delicious  my favorite of the two have to be the chicken artichoke because i love sundried tomatoes. i also ordered myself the Ricotta Ravioli  i loved it  the texture was so good and delicious i think i cleared my plate! for dessert they gave me a complimentary cream puff with some berries on it  my wonderful friend had also ordered me chocolate cake which completed my whole experience at Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What I liked about this place was the atmosphere and the service.  While the food was good  in my opinion it was over priced.  But I guess a lot of it goes to Bellagio fountain side rent.    Speaking of the fountians only the patio and tables near the window will get you a decent veiw.  My group was seated near the entrance and had a hard time seeing the fountains.  But the rest of the restraunt looked pretty nice or chic as the cool people say.  Vegetarian Rating: 3/5 a couple of entree options available (pasta and some pizza style flatbreads).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Average food at Vegas prices. There are much better places to eat at the Bellagio  not to mention other Casinos.   Food: Large portions  average quality Decor: Too Dark Service: Good  but ran out of blue moon beer. How's that possible? lol Conclusion: Unlikely to return
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  especially the Raspberry Souffle.  Incredible vantage point for viewing the Bellagio Fountain.  Our waiter  Paul A.  was the best we have ever had.  Amazing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Made a reservation for Sunday  in advance and said we were celebrating hubby's birthday  ok.  We get there and I tell the hostess that we are celebrating a birthday to make sure she notes in to the wait staff.  No mention from our waitress  Michelle?  She takes our order and everything comes out after a too long wait.  Good thing we sat on patio to distract us from the wait time.  The hostess ""supervisor"" wearing a red suit walked to every table except ours to greet.  It felt as though because we weren't white  we were ignored!  Still trying to have a good time on top of all this  and I go out to hostess to remind them we were celebrating a birthday and she notes it to server.   I quietly tell server it's a birthday for my husband and she says it's all covered.  We order dessert to share thinking my husband would receive something special...nothing came  we even got to the point of paying for our bill.  I mention to server and she says  ""oh  they didn't bring something?""  Duh  who is ""they"" isn't it you!  If we didn't already pay our bill I would have left NO tip!  I didn't want to make a scene and complain to a manager because we are celebrating a birthday!  The service was extremely slow  for the two of us  because everyone that was seated with us and after had already left! IIf it weren't for the fountain show our special evening would be disastrous memory.  Btw:  whoever answers the phones  learn how to have better phone etiquette  you sound very unprofessional and the tone of your voice is unbecoming of a Todd English establishment."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you make the earliest dinner reservation (5:00?) and arrive SUPER early to wait in line with the 50 other people who have the same idea  you can get a seat on the balcony for the Bellagio water show!  If you're like me  and everything on the menu always sounds/looks good  this is the one place you can ask the server what's best  and they'll be honest (or at least tell you what they like).  The flatbread pizza was excellent  and they don't mind if you linger - we were there for 3 water shows.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,On our last full day in Vegas we decided to check out Todd English's restaurant based on the great reviews and man  we sure are glad we did!   Our waitress was friendly asked if we wanted complimentary fresh bread which I could not resist being a sucker for fresh baked bread and tapenade. The bread did not disappoint so if something complimentary was this good  I can only image our meal!   My partner ordered the Grand Island Nebraska Beef Tenderloin which did not disappoint  the beef was cooked a perfect medium and the truffle whipped potato had so much flavour and was fluffy. I ordered Grilled Chicken Breast and requested extra broccolini instead of the potatoes and the waitress did not have any problem with that. The madeira jus was so flavourful and the chicken was very tender and juicy. Perfect.   We didn't have room for dessert  sadly  but this was overall  a great experience! If you want to check out a fine dining restaurant that serves great food  this is  definitely worth checking out. The prices were extremely fair compared to other Top Chef rated restaurants!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My second time here and it was just as fabulous!! The staff are great. We felt right at home. Food and atmosphere is great! The view of the fountains just tops this venue off. Who doesn't want great food while watching the world famous fountains? The only reason for 4 stars is the photo lady....I don't like sales people approaching me when I'm trying to enjoy this wonderful restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First  do the valet on Flamingo road  it's right off the freeway and it is way easier to find Olives when you do that  and you avoid having to walk by any slot machines in or out.  This place is so fantastic  you will want to stay all afternoon. Make sure you sit out on the patio so you can see the water show at least one time while your out there. My girlfriend was actually proposed to while sitting out there and they held the show till the groom to be got there to do it!! How cute is that!? I recently had lunch with my mother  Nana  aunt and sister for my graduation. my sister and I shared the portabello flat bread  OMG it was so amazing!!! Sip a glass of bubbly  order something light and gab with girls over yummy food.  Some of the dishes are heavy  and I say no to that for lunch. For dinner maybe  so you have your pick.  After lunch  walk around the shops and peek into Tiffany's and pick out fab diamonds for later purchase!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The sunday special Flatbread pizza was ""meh""  despite reading great reviews about this very item. I came here specifically for this. Had asked for a sweet wine recommendation as they did not have any Gewurztraminer by the glass  server suggested a Riesling that ended up being quite dry (even for most Rieslings scale) which was a bummer."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is excellent. Noise level is extreme and service is very rushed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was rather disappointed with my recent dinner at Olives in Las Vegas. I had high expectations given Chef English's reputation. There are now so many fine restaurants in LV  you'd think all would have to be at the top of their game to remain competitive.   I had their beef steak tartare to start. The Kobe beef and whatever seasoning they used were totally overpowered by the black truffle emulsion. The truffle flavoring should have been a subtle enhancement  instead it became the main focus of the beef and potato accompaniment. The waffle fries as they were described on the menu were 3 potato chips.   My Caesar salad was also a disappointment. The lettuce spears were soggy and limp. The dressing was distinctly over garlicked even to this garlic lover. There were exactly 3 little croutons and some mushy tomato pieces. The 6 freshly uncanned  stiff  anchovy fillets were thrown on top of the salad as an after thought. In contrast I enjoyed a delicious white anchovy filet on a salad nicoise earlier that day at another spot.  Service was good as was the signature olive tapenades.  But I'd go elsewhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great dinner:  - beef carpaccio outstanding. (2-4 people could share this.) - lobster bolognese inventive & outstanding. - zucchini flower/crema flatbread good  not great. (breading on flowers too heavy) - staff very friendly and laid back (unlike some other places that can be stiff). - breads and tapenades very nice. - ask to sit by window (or on terrace if not too hot) to enjoy fountains. Pretty cool to dine by 250 ft wall of water! - one drawback: seating is very cramped  and it's really loud. Reminds me of NYC restaurants  but in LV a bit more space is expected.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I ate here at lunchtime.  We stayed at the Bellagio with a lagoon view so seeing the fountain show wasn't such a big deal for us.  The bread they brought to our table was awesome.  Neither of us like olives but we did like the olive dips they brought to our table.  We had a cheeseburger and a pizza.  Neither were outstanding (particularly for that price  even in Vegas).  Our biggest irritation was that our server was always talking extensively to other diners and basically ignored us.  Yes  we are young but we might have ordered alcoholic drinks or dessert if we felt like we were being appreciated.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If I could rate this place -5  I would.  Worst service ever. Horrible food. And absolutely no understanding of how to treat customers. Left after what they call 'beef carpaccio' showed up... more like a mushy raw meat pizza.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What started as a great night ended up being a disappointment.  Everything went downhill - our food was delayed because another server took it  out of our wine selection with no recommendations  no apologies  no suggestions.  Won't go back again
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is amazing. I'll admit  anytime I go for Italian food  I generally try the ravioli. The bar has been set very high after dining at Olives. The cheese was smooth and creamy  which is a switch from most ricotta. The sauce was amazing and chunky. It tasted as close to fresh tomatoes as you can get. I had a pear martini before dinner and it was excellent.  Although very expensive  I highly recommend eating here if you get the chance.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We have ate at many different restaurants in Vegas and Olives by far is one of our favorite. The place is open for lunch then closes for a few hours and reopens at 5:30 for dinner. We were able to get there at 5 to ensure we could sit on the patio (best seats in the place). If you can get there early  definitely do that  there are only about 8 tables outside. In the evenings  the Bellagio Fountains go off every 15 minutes or so  it was truly a memorable experience. I also enjoyed their bar menu on an iPad. Each cocktail showed a picture  which i appreciated. Food overall was great! Complimentary trio of olive tapenade is available as well. For appetizer- I highly recommend the Beef Carpaccio! It is a must try!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First time - pleasant ! Daringly sat outside in the middle of summer knowing the heat but it wasn't too bad. Started with the watermelon/arugula salad and hummus both of them were good and perfect sizes. Entree was butternut squash pasta and the gnocchi with pesto? I believe . Everything was great and came out fairly quick. Prices weren't as pricey and I thought. It was also my birthday so they gave a commently dessert not sure what it was but it was kind! I'd go back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was a long wait to an order. Perfunctory  terrible service. The tapenade served with the bread was so salty it was pretty much inedible (Desalinate the olives in the big duh department  chef). The special lobster bisque and grilled cheese costs $25 big ones  but was sent back because it was tepid and humdrum for that ridiculous price PLUS they delivered it with no spoon for the soup. It took another 5 minutes just to flag a staffer and get one.    In the city full of restaurants kind of notorious for servers handle people like cattle  is the biggest most overpriced Cattlecall of them all.   Non-remarkable  extremely overpriced food. Every time I go into a Todd English restaurant I can be guaranteed of this kind of third-rate service (Their Boca Raton and West Palm Beach attempts in Florida were equally bad.). Brave of him to plaster his name on such mediocrity  in my humble opinion. Pass.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Best restaurant experience I have ever had. Great ambience!  The food was delicious and the service was outstanding. Ask for Paul as your waiter (best waiter I've ever had). High price but every penny was worth it! We love Olives (the restaurant)!!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you don't know by now  you need reservations in Vegas  especially good places in touristy areas.  My favorite thing here that i get all the time is the mussels.  The sauce would be the most amazing soup broth.  Wine choices here are great.  Service here has actually always been on par with how busy it always is.  Views of the Bellagio fountains is really nice.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Even though everyone raves about this place  I was not that impressed.  The decor was beautiful  it sits next to the Bellagio fountains  so every ten minutes or so you were able to see the fountain show.   The staff was semi-friendly. Our waitress seemed a little taken back by some of the questions we had. I'm sorry  if I don't know what something is  I am going to ask  not just order and hope for the best.   When it comes to food  we started off with the legendary bread and olive spreads. Both were delicious! I couldn't decide what I liked better  the chocolate rolls or the different oil spreads. Um!  We then moved on to appetizers. My tuna carpaccio was very good. The tuna tasted fresh and the glaze that was on top had a sweet soy glaze to it (it was special that night).   As far as the main meal is concerned I was deeply disappointed. I had the salmon tri which was basically  three salmons (duh) one seared salmon filet  one salmon tabouli  and one salmon cake. The only one that I liked was the seared salmon. Everything else had a strange after taste to it; so strange that I had one bite and put it aside. I didn't eat the meal. When my semi-friendly waitress noticed that I didn't eat my meal  she inquired why. I explained that I didn't like it and she offered me a dessert instead. No  she didn't ask me if I would like something else  no she didn't offer to take it off the bill or even half of it off the bill  she asked me if I wanted dessert. I couldn't have dessert that day (stupid diet I'm on) so I told her no thank you. I then thought  maybe she would take it off the bill at the end. Nope. I just spent $36 on a salmon tri that I took 3 or 4 bites of and then threw away. What a waste of money!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here with an out of town group and have to say was blown away by how much they took care of us. One of the the two couples we were with were celebrating their 10 year anniversary and they presented us with a magnificent table over looking the fountains.. now the food was delicious and the waitress was efficient but Hiro Spinelli really made the night.... hands down one of the most amazing displays of management I have ever seen. He was constantly checking on us and providing world class service. If we come back it's for him and his team   then the fountains. Great Job Olives!!!!!!!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We didn't actually get a chance to eat here. I made reservations for after my wedding ceremony. When I approached the hostess stand a couple days before and wanted to let them know I had booked for my wedding ""reception""  they were completely unresponsive. They really didn't care. Barely even said a word. One pointed to the other one's screen and then said ""there is a patio buy out that night""..... Ok  I then asked ""can you tell me what that means or...?""  So  screw them. I understand that people get married in Vegas all of the time  but you can at least pretend that my day will be special and it was nice of me to choose your restaurant for my reception."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,As a local  I've been wanting to get here for quite some time...one of my friends that frequents Olives loves everything about it.  Had a friend in town at Bellagio and during the heat wave  rather than hunt for a place to walk or drive  we chose Olives on a Tuesday evening about 8:00 pm.  Loved the ambience  the food was above average and the view of the fountains was worth the tab  for sure.  Cocktails were overpriced for their size (not surprised  being the strip and all) food textures a bit mushy but flavored nicely.  The fig & prosciutto flatbread is generous in size  but the base bread is rather floppy and soft  at least it was in our night.  My biggest disappointment was the noise level...off the charts loud.  It's definitely not an intimate dining experience although it looks that way.  Seating is super close and tight  but I get why with the need for maximum revenue for a prime locale.  I'd go again  but wouldn't try to do a business deal here or have a private conversation.  Great for a group  for sure :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We finally dined here last night after missing it on our last two Vegas trips  and although we did not sit on the coveted patio I'd say the experience was still very good.  The ambience inside the restaurant is certainly not comparable to the patio  but being illuminated by the fountains of Bellagio every fifteen minutes or so is still a treat inside or out.  The service was ok - not five star by any means  as it did take a little too long for our food to come out.  However  the meal was excellent (I had a skirt steak special) and made up for the slow service.  The portions are perfect  and although I felt that I over ate I can attribute that to eating four or five pieces of the delicious bread and olive spread.    We will be back  but next time we will make sure to get a spot on the patio!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The restaurant has a very fancy ambiance and gnocchi is very good! Malbec follows it nicely and smooth. The view to Bellagio fountains is a great feature.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olive's is nice. It's not spectacular. If you go for dinner  I highly recommend waiting to sit on the patio. It made an average restaurant much more enjoyable. Granted  we had an 8pm reservation and asking for the patio added almost two hours to that wait  but it was worth it.  The food is good  not great. It's definitely overpriced  but because of location -- I get it and expected it. Overall  it wouldn't discourage people from going at least once  but I doubt we will go back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing food. Amazing service. Top notch restaurant and an absolute must when in Vegas  we were able to get a next day reservation with no problem and got a great seat with a view of the Bellagio fountain. The scallops and sea bass were divine and the cookie butter creme brulee was unbelievably delicious!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I try and come here each time I'm in Vegas. Amazing food and great staff. I recommend for any occasion. As a chef myself  I strive to create amazing plates like this.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I NEVER eat at the same restaurant on vacation but I did it...I did it all for Todd English.   Now the place isn't cheap.  But it's convienietly located in the Bellagio so you can gamble  eat here  then go to a show...or go back to gambling.   It's a dimly lit restaurant with dark decor and very proper  nicely dressed servers.   We ended up getting 2 appetizers to share instead of getting an entree each.   The special of the day was a sausage flatbread.  It was so delicious.  The spicy sausage and the gooey cheese on top of the buttery  crispy flatbread made me drool.  It was so good that I went back the next day just to have it again!  We also got the kabobs.  The chicken and the beef were both tender and so well seasoned.  I hate biting into beef and having to gnaw my way through the thing but this was cooked perfectly.   The next night we got the the carpet baggers also.  Delicious.  Fried oysters on top of truffled mashed potatoes?  We licked those oyster shells clean!  I am still thinking about those to this day...  Not only were our appetizers quickly brought out but the bread basket they give you to start with is dangerous.  The rolls in the basket are varied so you wanna try each one: rosemary loaf  white chocolate bread  and crispy bread to dip into their complimentary olive spread.   If you are looking for a quick place to dine  make it Olives.  I'm a stuck up foodie but I have to say  this place was very impressive.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For two people that hate olives  my boyfriend and I loved Olives.  The service was SPECTACULAR and it made everything that was already great so much  much  much better. The best drinks I had during our week in Vegas were here. They were the first drinks we had here too  which should be noted. Very tasty...  Our server was honestly so great that I wish I could remember his name. Brian said he was hitting on me  but I so don't think so. He was just a very nice and authentic guy in a very strange and shallow town.  They bring out some olive purees  relishes and stuff  but since we don't love that we had some butter and an alternative dipping sauce that was much more to our liking. The breads were good and sour. We especially liked the one with onion on the top.  For lunch  we had pasta. I had one with clams and sausage in a spicy red sauce that the waiter recommended. I ate every last bite. It was totally  totally good. I almost got carried away and ate all of Brian's too. His had a more alfredo-type sauce with a bunch of bacon. Both dishes  I have to say  were superb.  Everyone is talking about how great the ambiance was  but I think that was the weakest aspect of the dining experience at Olives. Brian complained that the table was too small (he's a tall guy) and too close to the other tables. He also stated that it was a little on the pricey side. One positive aspect was that I could see the Dior boutique from my table. Eff the fountains  show me some handbags. Oui!  By the end of our lunch  I was completely drunk and full and happy. I have nothing but love for Olives. I wanted to go to this place a second time during our stay but Brian said no. But we'll be back on our next visit. I loved it. S.W.A.K.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I think that the best part of Olive's is the prime real estate that it's on.  Of course you're gonna love it if you get a terrace table and get to see the fountains go off--who doesn't like a good show?  And actually  the food is pretty good too.  The flat bread appy's are delicious.  I had the scallop entree which was very tasty.  My friend ordered the chicken which was a little on the dry side.  The chocolate dessert was amazing!!  But  the thing that left a bad taste in our mouths?  The piss-poor service.  I cannot believe that the waiters basically just dump the food in front of you.  They have no personality and are not friendly at all.  For this reason alone  I would not return to Olives.  Go eat somewhere else (it's Vegas  there's a lot of delicious food out there!)  and take in the free fountain show from the street afterwards.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was not impressed w/this place at all. Service was the main issue; our waiter was rude  slow  and overall terrible.   The food was pretty good  but coupled w/how overpriced it was and our absolutely appalling server  it gets 2 stars. The olive tampenade that kicked off the meal was awesome though...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A bit of a disappointing experience  since we had high hopes for this well reviewed restaurant.   I would say the food across the board was 2 stars. I would have been happy with the flavor and quality of the food if it were at a low cost chain restaurant  but at a place that is sold as a high end establishment  the food was really mediocre. I had a bib salad that was fine  but bland. It was overdressed and still had little flavor. My roasted chicken dish had better flavor  but the chicken was overlooked and dry and I did have to salt the dish. My fiance had the tuna tartar  which he said was also bland and lacking salt and acid. The real bummer was his rabbit entree  which he actually did send back. We both rarely send food back  but for the prices we thought it was worth being honest about the very poor quality of his dish.   Where Olives made up points with us was in how they handled the complaint about the rabbit dish. Our server was friendly  although seemed overworked and didn't come by many times to our table. He asked how our entrees were and when we weren't satisfied he involved the manager  they insisted on bringing a new dish for my fiance  and even remade my chicken so we could eat together. They manager recommended the lamb and my fiance was happy with that dish. They also did not charge us for the entree for my fiance at all. The service deserves 4 stars and if our server had less tables it would have been 5 stars  I'm sure.   If I lived in the area I might give them another try to see if the issues we had with the food were just because of an off night  but since we visit Las Vegas infrequently I'm sure we'll want to try another restaurant on our next visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great service  no TV in the bar  terrific view of the fountain  solid salmon and marvelous dessert.  What's not to like?  Oh yeah  the check.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Honestly  Todd English -- I'm not exactly laboring under the delusion that you're back there working the line  but your name is on the door and you should be embarrassed.   - As a woman dining alone  I was treated like a seating challenge  rather than a guest.  - Raw garlic on an un-wiped condiment tray (tapenade smears on the sides are visually alarming) just sets a really sloppy tone for the meal.  - The Bibb salad was so harshly dressed with an overly acidic vinaigrette  nearly raw onions & raw walnuts that 3 hours and 2 coffees later  I can still taste it on my tongue.  - The board for the flatbread sits so awkwardly on the table (it was longer than my arm)  it's hard to maneuver around. The fig and prosciutto flatbread itself was so oil-drenched  overly sweet AND overly salty all at one  I ate one piece out of crazy hunger and left the rest behind with most of the salad.  This was honestly the worst restaurant meal I've had in two years  and sadly  the worst meal before that was at another Todd English restaurant. I want to give him the benefit of the doubt because he has in the past had such a great reputation  but I've been too badly burned twice. Other chefs who actually care deserve my dining dollars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We've had a really nice experience last night at this restaurant. The food was perfect-worth every penny. I've tried the most amazing raspberry souffle in my life!!!! It just melted in your mouth. The restaurant's atmosphere is dynamic and loud  so if you are looking for something more quite and private  this is not your place to be at. But we didn't mind that. Chose not to sit on the patio since it was 95 degrees  and I like to enjoy my food at a cooler temperature.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Had reservations on a Saturday night (10/11/14) with my wife and her parents. Wanted to sit outside but settled for inside as there was no open outside seating until after 9pm. Good ambiance and a nice setting with the fountains faintly visible in the background.  Food: Menu had many options that looked great and we all ordered something different. Unfortunately  the food was so average to below average that it led me to write a review . The ladies each ordered a flat bread  (Prosciutto and Fig & Spicy Chicken Sausage). They were fine but nothing memorable. Below average dough with some fancy toppings. Father-in-law ordered the special  Braised Short Ribs. It had good flavor but a little on the dry side. Lastly  I ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. It was $34. It was an Olive Garden dish that had a bout 4 or 5 mushrooms in it. It even had the ""Signature Dish"" stamp next to it; it was a disappointing signature dish. I'm rarely a harsh critic when it comes to food but the price we paid and the meal we got was disappointing.  So why 3 stars instead of 1 or 2... The servers  managers and everyone that had to answer a million questions from my mother-in-law. They were so friendly and genuine in their conversations. I am terrible and can't remember their names  but the staff that worked with our table saved the experience."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Started with Foie gras. Amazing preparation. Large and succulent with caramelized apples on brioche.   Boston salad. Very fresh and vibrant but very heavy onions. Needed salt.   Lobster fettuccine. Fresh pasta  rich and creamy. Silky texture on the fettuccine. A good  flavorful dish. It could've used a bit more lobster meat for the price.   Sea bass. One of the best preparations i can recall. The natural flavor of the fish was accentuated as a main ingredient and not covered up by a fancy sauce. The texture was impeccable. Paired with tender fingerlings and sweet corn  this dish was very memorable.   We got a reservation through open table on a Saturday no problem. Service was courteous and fast. I would return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a great experience.  Service  food and view were excellent.  The bread with tapenade was delicious.  We both ordered specials  free range turkey and lamb chops  and thoroughly enjoyed.  Wish that I had room for dessert! Sabine was our server  she was very attentive.  We will definitely return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We stopped here for dinner right when it opened before a show. My husband and I ordered the Butternut Squash Tortellini and the Brick Oven Chicken. It was delicious! The portion size was good. Fast and friendly service. Drinks were good but a little fizzy. The flatbread and spreads where incredibly well matched.   Definitely get there early or you might need a reservation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've never had anything at Olives that wasn't completely fantastic.  Drinks are delicious  too.    Minus one star since it gets very loud.  If you want a cozy  intimate dining experience  this is not the place.  Fabulous food  though.  You won't be disappointed if you are looking for a delicious meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I. Love. This. Restaurant. We go every time we are in Vegas. The food is fabulous  the service is stellar! We always sit on the patio so we can watch the Bellagio fountains while we enjoy our meal. It doesn't get any better than this. Order the beef carpaccio  you will not be sorry! Make reservations or you may not get in (the hostesses here can get a bit snotty about it).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is always our first & last cocktail in Vegas.  Joey  Regina  Raul  Jon & Chris are expert bartenders.  We love that they remember us & our favorite drinks.  The food is also terrific and Raul & Jon are easy on the eyes! Regina is a superwoman behind the bar!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I made a reservation at Olives a couple of months before my trip Vegas this past week. At the time I made the reservation I decided to go to Olives over the myriad of other choices in Vegas because it would accomplish two tasks. The first being my brother and I would be able to visit the Bellagio that night to enjoy a good meal and the second being I requested a seat on the terrace so that we could view the fountain show while we ate. Perfect plan right? Well let's just say that high winds don't mix with outdoor dining and water shows. Needless to say I was very disappointed.   Although we didn't get to sit on the terrace we were able to enjoy a pretty good meal. I started with a seared Ahi Tuna appetizer and then had the Duck Two Ways for my entree. Both were very good and well prepared and well presented. To say I was blown out of the water would be a vast overstatement. It was good but next time I'm in Vegas I will take my time to dine elsewhere.   Eat here if you can guarantee a spot on the terrace. If not there are far better options at this price point.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My husband and I made last minute reservations here for dinner after a show on Saturday night and we are so glad we did. The restaurant was busy when we arrived at 9pm  but we were sat right away. This restaurant offers beautiful views of the Bellagio fountain  so it was nice to watch the show go off every 15 mins or so.  Our waitress was accommodating and friendly  and took the time to go through things on the menu we weren't quite sure about. We ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread  it had shaved ham  mozzarella  asparagus and caramelized onion. It was very good  the bread had a nice consistency  doughy but crisp. My husband ordered the special  spaghetti and meatballs in a cream sauce. He said it was good  but the cream sauce lacked in flavor. I ordered the beef tenderloin  it came as a perfect medium. It had a nice crust to it  and was like butter when cut. The mashed potatoes were nice  as well as the tempura asparagus. We also chose to get the zucchini sticks  and so glad we did. They were seriously one of the tastiest things I ate our whole trip.   The service here was amazing  and super attentive. Drinks were topped off frequently  and I'm pretty sure it would be impossible to finish a water without someone refilling it. Food was served quickly as well  we spent less than an hour here  but never once felt rushed. We will definitely return here when we come back to Vegas !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate here at 08/21/13 - Wednesday evening. Our reservation was for 7:30pm. We got there and requested a table on the outside patio and were seated after only a 5 minute wait. The table wasn't at the front of the patio unfortunately and was quite far back but to say we were seated almost immediately I was in no position to complain. We still managed to have a lovely (if not fairly obscured) view of the strip and bellagio fountains. I managed to walk up to the front to get a bit closer before paying the bill and I got a good view and some nice pictures.   The food it's self was delicious. My friend and I ordered the beef carpaccio to start with and we shared it  the portion was very large for a starter and the taste was amazing. Then for main course we also both ordered the butternut squash ravioli. This also was impeccable in taste. The portion size wasn't enormous but it was enough to say we had a fairly large starter  I left a couple of pieces of pasta as I was so full and couldn't manage any more. I wish I could have managed dessert as I can imagine it would be just as delicious as the other two courses but we just couldn't eat any more. I suppose it didn't help that we started our meal not very hungry initially from having a huge lunch also. We also ordered two strawberry cheesecake cocktails and they were lovely  nice and strong!   The service was ok. Just ok. Nothing spectacular and our waiter was fairly odd  attentive but with a slight air of arrogance?? We still left a generous tip though because we had an overall pleasant experience.  I would return here in a heartbeat. Great view  even better food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best dining experience in Vegas! I've been here twice and it was amazing on both occasions. My recommendations are the beef carpaccio for an appetizer and beef tenderloin for dinner. Not only is the food delicious  but the wait staff is so friendly and doesn't rush you at all...you'll want to take your time to see all of the fountain shows!   On our first visit  for my boyfriend's birthday  our waitress brought out a complimentary dessert and offered to take our picture. She even made sure to come over and offer just as the fountains were starting  so we got some great photos. I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out  but thank you so much! You made it a birthday celebration we will never forget and are still talking about a year later!   On our second visit  our waiter was Paul and he was THE BEST. When we were first seated  there was a large party sitting in front of us  so we couldn't see the fountains as well  but as soon as they finished  he came over and moved us right up to the front. We didn't complain about the first seating or anything  he was just truly a great waiter. Also  thank you so much for allowing us to take our time (drinks  appetizers  dinner  then coffee and dessert). Our whole party agreed that it was so nice to be able to enjoy the view and company without feeling like we were inconveniencing the staff.   No reservations for the patio  so we always make a reservation for 6 PM  check in and request to sit on the patio  then come back in about 45 minutes for our table! Perfect timing to grab a pre-dinner cocktail and then return for a spectacular view and amazing dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I didn't eat here.  This review is based on my experience making a reservation as a surprise for my sister's birthday  for which I left a credit card to foot the bill.  I spoke with Nicole  who took down my credit card information.  I also requested seating on the patio  which wasn't guaranteed  but Nicole seemed attentive to my plea and said she would see what she would do since she was working that night.    My sister called me  said the food was great  and was happy that the restaurant had sat her and the family (including her two young kids) at the patio.  Apparently  the kids really loved seeing the fountains go off every so often.    Thanks Nicole!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow one of the best restaurants in Vegas!!  -blueberry infused vodka: soooo good  -bread  olives & olive dip starter: delicious  -tuna/rock shrimp appetizer: so good!  -scallops with risotto: so good & amazing presentation   -Lamb: best lamb we've ever had! Ordered it medium rare! Melts in your mouth!    Soooo good! Will def be back!!   Outside views of the water show!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love the patio on Lake Bellagio!!!  This restaurant is one of my favorites in Vegas.  Perfect lunch spot.  Service is great  food is excellent and ambiance is perfect.  I had lunch today and had a seafood pasta special.  Great flavors  good portion size and the pasta was homemade.  My mom had crab stuffed prawns.  They were really good too!  This restaurant is always a great option in Vegas!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Consistent  great service and a wonderful view. It is truly one of my Vegas favorites. Tuna tartare is excellent as is the scallops! Big fan of Todd English whom I met and thought what a gentlemen... I make a point to stop in and always impressed with how much pride the staff has working there. Just absolutely love it! Just make your reservations because it gets packed!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Of all of my dining experiences at Vegas  this one is definitely up there.  This restaurant is located in the heart of The Shops of Bellagio.  I had the Sea Scallops and it was simply awesome.  Very nice presentation.  The complimentary bread and olives were very tasty.  The ambiance was dark and classy.  Also  I certainly can't complain about customer service.  I think I discovered my new favorite Vegas spot.    I opted to sit at the bar  but the best spot is on the patio where you can see the water show.  I'd advise  however  that you make reservations because the patio appeared to be packed even for a weekday.  I can't imagine what it would be like on a weekend.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not impressed. Wait staff are rushed. We had water spilled on us twice. Meals overpriced. We spent $160 for lunch for four people. Two of the four had to send their meals back. One was the wrong order- ordered fish special of the day and got a pork chop?? Not even an apology.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great views  amazing bread and olive tapenade (sp?). Out server Jamie was very very very great! I am vegan and she suggested ways to alter their dishes to make them vegan friendly. Great service  great food  great atmosphere. Oh  and John Stamos was sitting next to us.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my 2nd time here at the Olives in LV.  G wanted to have a view of the Bellagio water show but it was just too dang hot to sit outside where the view is the best.  We settled for a table by the window and beyond the dark interior and the pillars in our way  I caught snippets of the show  especially when the fountains spouted high.  The food at Olives is good  but not enough for me to remember what I had the first time around.  This second time  I had the tuna tartare and the roast chicken.  G had the roast squid and octopus and the chicken sausage flatbread.  I would have to say the appetizers were better than the entrees.  They were also sizable portions so G and I doggie bagged our barely touched entrees for later.  The fast  efficient and professional staff were even kind enough to pack in extra onion bread and their famous olive tapenades so we had a late night feast/breakfast after our gambling and partying.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really amazing food. The wait staff was really cool. One of our friend's salmon was over cooked and our waiter made sure it was immediately taken care of. The beef carpaccio was delicious. The ambiance is very sexy. Good all around.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great restaurant and m very nice environment. So Italian. The seafood selection is amazing   the sea bass is awesome and flatbreads are so delicious!  Amazing view to Bellagio fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had lunch on a Saturday afternoon at Olives and wasn't impressed.  It's not that the food and drinks was bad  it was just too pricey for what you got.  Make sure you avoid Mojitos here  because at $14 a piece  they were more expensive than each of our lunch entrees.  Perhaps dinner would be better?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is one of the restaurants my family and I guarantee'd eat at when in Vegas. It's been a favorite for years now  from the fountain view  to the cuisine  this restaurant is Las Vegas. I've always tried different items from the menu and I've always been more than satisfied with my order. You'll find unique dishes that'll have your mouth watering. If you've never been here then you have to give it a try!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had an early dinner and got to sit on the patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  The server was excellent: friendly  attentive  a big smile.  We kept thinking he looked like Steve Harvey.  Food was equally good.  We started with a charcuterie plate with meats  cheeses  dried figs and candied walnuts.  That and the bread  tapenade  and olives could have been its own meal.  For entrees  my wife got the gnocchi with chicken  olives  and a tomato sauce.  It was probably the lightest  richest gnocchi ever.  I had the sea bass  which was also excellent.  Fish was fresh  fatty  and cooked perfectly.  I didn't care much for the white bean and tomato roulade but did like the brocolini.  We also had tempura green beans that were very good.  Finally  dessert was yummy.  It was essentially tiramisu made with banana bread.  Whoever came up with that idea is a genius.  A big scoop of vanilla ice cream and more chelate sauce would have made it perfect  but kudos to the dessert chef on this one!  If you are looking for a nice dinner in Vegas  I highly recommend Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Chef Todd English's restaurant is among the gourmet delights on the Strip. Its setting inside the Bellagio Hotel overlooks the wonderful fountains  and diners (indoors and out) have a terrific view while enjoying delicious meals. Our dinner experience there was quite enjoyable -- excellent dishes -- without earning five stars  mostly for reasons of slowish  occasionally inattentive service. Not anything serious  mind you  but enough that we noticed  something that shouldn't occur at a five-star establishment  in our view.    As for the food  well  hard to top it. We were especially fond of the beef carpaccio  yummy and ever-so flavorful and very appealing to the eye  too. The lobster bisque was full-bodied and creamy good  the Caesar salad as fresh as could be  and the tuna tartare had just the right amount of spice taste and texture for us. Finishing or meal with the fruit sorbet was delightful. Alas  our server occasionally seemed to lose us and water refills weren't as often as they should have been. On balance  however  a strong four-star experience and a recommendation to others up for a fine dining treat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had incredibly high expectations for Olives and they were definitely met!    At first  I was pretty upset; we made reservations for my birthday dinner and were running about ten minutes late.  We called to let them know and they said it was no problem at all.  When we got there  the hostess was a little rude and so was another guy who was working there. We understood that there would be a little bit of a wait  but when they said our table was being set  and then ten minutes go by  we asked about how much longer it would be and they seriously snapped at my friend...it was pretty ridiculous. However  we were starving and really didn't want to find another place  so we ignored the rudeness and ate there anyway. We ended up sitting on the patio  overlooking the Bellagio water show and it was incredible.  We had an incredibly nice waitress  who was super helpful and attentive.  My girls and I all ordered their flatbreads and they were fabulous.  So much flavor and sooo big!   Their cokage fee was only $35  which is really great  so don't be afraid to bring a fab bottle of champagne to enjoy  while you're enjoying the wonderful ambiance.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,After hearing glowing reviews from acquaintances  I chose here for date night with the boyfriend. I'm definitely not disappointed! Amazing  amazing food. We made reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night and only waited a couple minutes to get seated. Our server was very personable and friendly; he even offered to take photos of us after dinner. The food was nothing short of incredible- I had the spaghetti bolognose and it's easily the best pasta I've had in my life. Perfect flavors  well-balanced. My boyfriend got the NY Strip and said he never had a steak of that type so good before. We will definitely be back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice place.  Waited for outside patio table and 20 minutes later had the perfect seat to celebrate my wife's birthday.  Food and wine were excellent.  Wine is pricey but not surprising for a high end restaurant on the strip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Lazy   lazy!!  IT HAS SLIPPED big-time  this week  at least. Usually one of my favorite LV restaurants  Olives let me down--and on a special occasion  too.   Specifics: The Caesar salad included relentless little chunks of hard  unripe tomato (???)  stale croutons  and no anchovy at all  that I could taste. Well  maybe they waved one over the romaine  but the dressing was SO bland  and of course there was no salt or pepper on the table  this being such a special place.  Well.  Ricotta ravioii with Italian sausage: gummy pasta  raw-tasting tomato ""sauce "" virtually unseasoned  and very light on the sausage  too  though I finally found a couple of pieces hiding out.  Dessert: Nice generous portion of coconut creme brulee  very good  but with a little PARROT MESS of a topping (mango something)  and two sugar cookies that were not just stale  but ""off "" as in bitter-bordering-on-rancid.  Okay. No  I didn't complain or send anything back. I was a guest  and it was  as I mentioned  a special occasion. But they should at least TRY  even on a Tuesday night.   Generalities: Okay  I know Las Vegas food likes to be ""fancy "" perhaps thinking that helps to justify the prices  but really  parts of the menu were such an overwrought throwback! I never thought anyone could make softshell crab sound bad  but bragging about a watermelon panzanella salad (olives  feta croutons  etc.) really ruined it for me.  On wonderful softshell crab?  What  they don't have any confidence in their own dish  or their cooking abilities?   And who could make CAKE sound bad? Well  describing it as ""dirty south styled almond cake"" did the trick.  Urk.  Rice  maybe  but not cake.  SO disappointed..."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I liked the food and atmosphere  my friend thought it was just alright.   I made a reservation through Open Table and requested to be seated outside. Upon checking in with the hostess we were brought to our table and seated inside the dining area. I found it a little odd that the hostess did not acknowledge my request from the beginning. She could have said  ""Hello  I see that you requested to sit outside  however this is not currently available  would you still like to join us for dinner tonight?""   And I completely get that probably 90% - 100% of people who make a reservation are looking for outside seating (which is extremely limited)  but a simple conversation at check in would prevent any confusion or disappointment. I'm sure the host team is at the point where they have so many people requesting outside that they just avoid the conversation altogether so as not to get angry people or lose those who made a reservation.  While eating there  I did see a couple who threw a tantrum when they were brought to their seats inside. The guy started to create a scene over not getting to sit outside  and was eventually subdued by staff. However  after their server came over and started them off with drinks  the two left the restaurant.   Just be honest and up front and let the person decide.   In terms of food  the bread was great  it is served with various olive spreads. I ordered the tuscan flatbread for dinner which was sizable and was salty but savory. My friend ordered the ravioli  which he thought was too tomatoey and over sauced  and therefore not too enjoyable.Service is five stars  as there are multiple people taking care of you throughout the course of the meal."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was perfect - as it should be for the price. The scallops were the best I've ever had - served on top a bed of mushroom risotto with truffle oil. The drinks were good  too  and I enjoyed that the drink menu was an iPad - interactive  informative  and fun.  We only came here because we were in Vegas for only one evening - a Tuesday - and Picasso is closed on Tuesdays. Next time - Picasso!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Read great reviews before coming tonight. Was sadly disappointed in my meal. The pork loin roulade was VERY VERY DRY. We complained to the waiter but after an offer of free dessert and drinks  which were turned down  was left with a full bill for over priced dry meat with cold vegetables.!!!!!  Stay away!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I used to really look forward to visiting Olives.  But this news report has caused me to reconsider future visits.  Does anyone have a different perspective?  Rather unflattering report.  http://www.boston.com/Boston/businessupdates/2012/05/boston-officials-say-chef-todd-english-left-his-closed-faneuil-hall-restaurant-shambles/4NgD7C8aIfP6BRZcqyF9gM/story.html?p1=News_links
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"What a disappointment...they ruined my daughter's 16th birthday:  We had a 5:30 reservation made 2 months in advance that was confirmed 2 weeks prior. Both times it was made known that it was my daughter's sweet 16 birthday and that we would like a patio table and that we had tickets to ""O"" at 7:30. We were assured there would be no problems....  We showed at 5:10 and needless to say  we ate a small table inside barely big enough to hold 3 dinner plates (and there were 4 of us) that had no view of the fountains. When I inquired about the view table I was rudely told that they do not ""guarantee"" such things even for special occasions...this was the ONLY reason we wanted to eat here.  Our service was so bad that  we had to ask for our dinner plates to be removed 20 minutes after we had all stopped eating. Tables around us were receiving slightly quicker and more attentive service. We were only offered refills on our drinks after finishing our meal despite being there an hour and a half. At the hour and half mark (we only had entrees as we never would have had time for dessert) my wife and daughters left the restaurant and I asked for the bill. Only THEN did our waiter acknowledge that we were celebrating a birthday (this was the first time anyone on staff did and since we did not tell him it must have been noted on the reservations from our previous contacts). He stated he had something special for her and that he'd box it up...this took 10 more minutes. When my daughter opened the dessert it turned out to be 3 sorry little truffles and a beat up strawberry...wow how special was that.  The food itself was mediocre and definitely not worth the cost. Our bill was $250 for 4 entrees  2 cocktails  1 beer  1 soda. Meal time was 1.5 agonizingly slow hours. We would have liked dessert but had no time due to needing to get to our show.  I put myself through school waiting tables and have worked at some very nice resorts. This restaurant dropped the ball in everyway with no apologies."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My favorite restaurant in Vegas  basically because of the Bellagio fountain views. I tend to go here each time I come to the city.  Dinner on the balcony with the fountain show next to you is pretty cool.  Even having just drinks/cocktails outside is nice.  Food and service is great.  They are very accommodating and will help you make events special.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We go to Olive's every time we are in Vegas. Service is wonderful. Food is divine. Lovely ambiance. Definitely get a reservation. The ONLY disappointment is that you can't reserve the patio  it's first come  first served. But sitting inside is nice too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Joe are server was great and the hostess sat us right next to the railing on the patio for my friends birthday! We had an amazing dinner and dining experience. One of the best I've ever had.   Also  the beef carpaccio. You just have to.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was good  but not the best.  Todd English's Bonfire in Boston is definitely better. View of fountains is awesome along with the decor.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The only thing negative i can say about Olives is the wait time. However the wait we had even though we had reservations was worth it. They ended up seating us on the balcony so we could watch the great fountain show. Our waiter was really great and funny and the managers would come around to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. Theres no complaints about the food. I had the free range roasted chicken and all i can say is that chicken died for a good cause.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,In town for a conference  and after a great lunch here 2years ago  suggested our group try it for dinner.  The wait was tolerable with our reservation  but the room was over filled and screaming loud. Services was slow due probably to the crowded dinning room  but Joel was attentive and helpful.  Come hungry  portion sizes were huge!  Wine list is on an iPad  which was going dead...a little more attention to detail may be helpful.  Lunch experience was much better than dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I only had the pleasure of grabbing a quick lunch at the bar  but I was very impressed. The bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the bar menu  the dinner menu  and Las Vegas in general. He offered several suggestions pertaining to the restaurant and the city  all very spot on. The cocktails are delicious  but they pack a punch (as they should). I cannot rave about the flat bread enough. Everything was perfect. This was an impromptu visit and I'm so glad it worked out that way.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is located inside of the Venetian hotel. I came here during my visit to Vegas because of the recommendation of a friend. We had the prosciutto and fig flatbread with an octopus appetizer. The flatbread was phenomenal! Good flavor and a hefty amount of prosciutto AND fig. The octopus was a little chewy and the flavors weren't to too impressive.  What makes this place so wonderful was the wonderful service. Our server was attentive  and our glasses of water were never even less than half full. He bussed our table appropriately  and timed the dinner service exceptionally well.  Although Olives is a little pricey  if you can afford it they do have great lunch options.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,8/7/09 - Went with friends from out of town and decided to have a bunch of apps before going out for the evening. Our waitress was excellent  very attentive  extremely helpful and completely on top of things. We had the portabello flatbread which was very good  the caprese stack salad which was fantastic  the tomatoes were amazing with the balsamic reduction! We also had the softshell crab which had a really good spicy sauce accompanying it  the pea agnolotti which wasn't my favorite but the girls really liked it. Last but not least we had the beef carpaccio which is absolutely one of the best I've ever had  anywhere! One thing I found disappointing was that the foie gras is no longer on the menu at this time. This in no way hampered our experience but it is one of the best in town and I missed having it. All in all a great experience which we've come to expect at Olives. Highly recommended. The bill came to $195 after lots of food  4 cocktails and 4 glasses of great wine. Not too bad considering the service  quality of the food and our great waitress  Jaime B.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great view of the fountains at the Bellagio. Everything we tried was excellent. Fig & prosciutto flat bread pizza  the olive tapenade.  A large place with plenty of seating. Right by the hotel & the shops at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My friends and I stumbled upon here by accident.  It was the last day of our trip and we wanted a drink at Fix  but it was closed.  We had dinner reservations at Spago  so we thought we'd make our way over there and grab a drink on the way.  That's when we found Olives.  Their bar was open so we stopped in.  Their bartenders are fantastic  their martinis are huge and the water show's wonderful.  As we were sipping our drinks  I was curious about the infused vodkas.  That's when the bartender asked if I'd like a taste.  Of course I would!  So he poured me a good amount  shook it up to chill it and served it up.  That's service.  As we were sitting there  since the bartenders were so nice  we decided to cancel our Spago reservation and ate at Olives.  We also wanted to sit outside and watch the fountain show.  The patio seating is 1st come  1st serve and we had no problem with that.  What we had a problem with was the gale force winds blowing through.  It blew down a bunch of the glasses on the tables  which changed our minds about dining al fresco.    Once we were back inside  we ordered and our apps came out.  They were HUGE.  Just as big as their martinis.  Had I known that  I would've stuck with just the apps.  When my entree came out  I could barely eat it and ended up taking it home.  Yes  home on the plane - it was that good.  The best part was that we were sitting next to the door and the candle on our table kept blowing out.  But our server was super diligent in re-lighting it over and over again.  It was either diligence  or fear of getting his ass kicked for not keeping it lit.  Kudos to him!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's been so long since we've been here but we came here for lunch last Saturday. Much to my surprise and delight  the tuna carpaccio was still on the menu! We were in the mood for appetizers so this is what we ordered:   * tuna carpaccio - as delicious as I remembered  * truffle fries - so good! * fig and prosciutto flatbread - average * grilled octopus and squid - not good (there was a fishy aftertaste)  One star for service  one for the tuna carpaccio and one for the truffle fries.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic service and great food.   We made a reservation for 5 pm and got there a little before 5 but we still had to wait in line (5 min) as number of people also made the reservation for 5.  We ordered beef tenderloin and white fish along with mushroom flatbread.   Not too crazy about the tempura string beans on beef but everything else came out perfectly cooked especially the fish.  Would go back next time when we are in vegas. Definitely!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've been to Olives many times  and it was great each time.  It's a perfect place for a quick satisfying lunch.  Most of the time  I was there for lunch  only had a dinner there once which was also great.  Not really a pizza fan  but their portobello mushroom pizza is so good.  I really like their beef carpaccio too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I usually have a 4 start experience at Olives  but service and product execution left a lot to be desired on our latest trip. I was  put off by the cocktail list which has given in to the recent Vegas trend of sweet  large  and ingredient heavy drinks that are more about style than substance. My husband's  ""rare"" steak came out mid-well- a major disappointment for an avowed carnivore. The other meals were fine  though not rave-worthy. Most frustrating was the completely incompetent service that left our glasses empty and orders untaken for entirely too long; the awkwardness when she would actually make it to our table was painful. All this being said  the atmosphere is inviting and the view of the Bellagio fountains is lovely. I used to say that Olives was an affordable upscale option in Vegas with 4 star food; I now consider it and affordable option with 4 star ambiance  but with 3 start food and 2 star service."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What an experience! Michelle  our waitress  picked out a delightful Napa valley wine  Taken. The presentation of our entrees was perfect. My NY strip special steak is only on the menu sometimes so I took advantage. The Chilean Sea Bass was moist and flavorful and a big portion. The lemon drops beforehand were the best we had ever had. Michelle was a wonderful waitress and we would ask for her next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really?! Four stars for overpriced food? Yeah  you can argue that everything in Las Vegas is expensive but the food should be a step up from what Italian chains offer. There was nothing memorable about this place. The menu selection was limited to only around 10 main dishes all over $20. You could get the same thing at Macaroni Grill or Bravos for half the price without sacrificing the quality! I would avoid going here and spend my money elsewhere like Bouchon's Bistro. Bouchons is also expensive but you definitely get your moneys worth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had dinner at Olives before our Cirque du Soleil show since both venues were located at the Bellagio.   We weren't seated near a window  like I'd requested when I made the reservation for three. Instead we were seated in the middle of the dining room with contagious excited energy stirring around us.   We shared: -- Crab beignets: beignet was light & very crispy & filled with a sweet/savory crab filling. Topped with a delicate avocado sauce. Delicious! -- shrimp encrusted mahi mahi: crispy fried shrimp sit atop firm  mild-tasting fish. Came with a bit of mushroom risotto.  --fig & prosciutto flatbread: I am a fan of thin crust pizzas so I loved that their menu has a variety of flatbreads. This one was a mix of salty from the gorgonzola cheese & prosciutto & sweet from the figs & fig jam. Crust was thin  but chewy & flavored with Rosemary. Try it!  Every dish was so sophisticated  so fancy in it's execution & presentation  as well as brimming with flavor. The bread basket came with a parmesan crisp & a chocolate bread that paired so well with their olive tapenade. We left with very happy mouths.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really good food but all the food is good at this hotel. What wowed me is the host staff. They had my party of 16 sat in a minute or two and even sat us in a lovely area of the restaurant so we can chat and  relax after walking outside  for a bit in the hot August air. BTW The Gnocchi was REALLY good!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Get the jumbo scallops. Oh dear lord  they are like pillows of silky goodness  crafted by baby angels and seared with flames from heaven.. Not that heaven's particularly known for its flames. So maybe flames from hell. But you know  when I think of flames from hell  I think of like super spice! Tongue-numbing hot stuff! And these scallops aren't like that at all. They're tender  juicy  mounds of love  served on a bed of creamy risotto... *sigh*  Well anyways  that was my experience the first two times I came here. The third time though  the scallops lacked flavour and the risotto was undercooked. I could feel each separate grain straining against my teeth  and that ain't good. You want your risotto to MELT once it comes in contact with your tongue!!!  If you want a somewhat interesting experience  go for the halibut. It rests on a mound of lime-green risotto that tastes like a savory margarita. And I mean that in a good way. Like  you know  margarita  but warm and rich and salty. Okay that doesn't sound too good  but trust me  it's better than it sounds!  The service here ranges from ehhh to awesome  depending on when you come. Given the time  our servers were able to pile on the charm and lavish upon us their flattery and attention and come up with numerous recommendations for the night. But when we came again on a Saturday night  the servers were harried and would often disappear for 20 minutes at a time. But not to worry  order a round of the specialty drinks and you won't even notice the lack of attention from your server.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olive's is a Mediterranean inspired restaurant  and per its name  many of the dishes rely heavily on the use and flavor of different varieties of olives. Meals begin with an ample basket of bread that is served with multiple olive garnish ""mashes."" Our table also had one of the flatbreads for a starter which was very unique and delicious.  For the main course  I had a combination of a veal special and the butternut squash ravioli both recommended by the server. The ravioli was one of the best I have ever had and the veal was very well cooked and tasty.  Having described the meal  I can say with confidence that there is definitely better food in Las Vegas  but the thing that sets Olive's apart is its location right beside the Bellagio water show. With an outside seating  Olive's is a can't miss spot  but with an inside seating  there are other spots where your money would be better spent. Like many of the restaurants in Vegas  the food is great and prepared by a world class kitchen staff and created by a world class chef  but amidst all of the incredible food in Vegas  Olive's food doesn't particularly stand out in my mind."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,HORRIBLE experience in every way possible!  Olives has always been our go to place every time we go to Vegas which is about 4 times a year!  This time it was my birthday week and I wanted to show off Olives to my family.  We arrived at 12:05 and were seated inside.  Waiter finally came over and took our drink orders.  The bread and olive tapenade were slow to arrives as well.  Our food orders were taken and we waited  we waited  we waited...the order was taken at 12:20!!!  As I was waiting I needed more water...the bussers (4 of them) were gathered around the wait station having face to face conversations with each other completely ignoring not only me but  the rest of the customers.  My husband had to get up go over tap one on the shoulder to finally get water refills.  Our food was served and all of the dishes were cold.  Three flat breads cold  chicken/beef skewers cold  my trout cold with limp gooey french fries (not fresh cut ones either).  We had to get up and find the waiter and told him our food was cold. Of course he acted so surprised.  He took my trout and the skewers and 15 mins later returned with the food.  The kitchen had recooked a trout and PUT IT ON TOP OF THE COLD FRIES FROM BEFORE!  Also  did the same thing with the skewers...so bad that the first skewer he had taken a bite off of was STILL ON THE PLATE!  Once again had to wave down the waiter. and showed him.  He came back and said that the busser told him he had thrown out the first order and that my husband was wrong.  CALLED HIM A LIAR basically!  I was so pissed at this point.  The waiter said he was getting us chocolates to make up for it.  We waited another 30 friggen' minutes for these damn chocolates and we finally got up and went to the bar to get our check.  We saw the waiter go to the manager  some woman  and talk to her.  We figured he was telling her a big made up story about how we were wrong or something.  I went to her and told her what had happened and I was furious at this point.  She showed no emotion  gave no explanation but  took her sweet ass time to ring up the check! I told her that we shouldn't have even been charged for the drinks or anything it was such a horrible experience.  She just gave me a dead pan look and said nothing.   We get back to the room with these chocolates and it was 4 balls the size of marbles with a strawberry cut in half!!!!  I can not believe how bad the service  food and attitude has deteriotated at OLIVES!  I was embarrassed in front of my family after having talked this place up and to have this horrible experience and being treated so horrible at the same time!  I will never go back to Olives and will be sure to tell everyone I know to never go there!!! IT sucks!  The one star is only because it's in the BELLAGIO which we love.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing view  food and service.  The only draw back were the tables were quite close to one another.  The table behind us kept hitting our chairs as we were eating.  For the price point  I would have expected a bit more comfort.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sorry  but = nope.  Stuffy.  Lacked vibe and personality. Overpriced (portions were tiny  too). Plates were good  as in they tasted good. Service lagged.  We had to flag the waitress down more than once .. And this after waiting a hot minute in the first place. They weren't slammed  either.  Only thing that was on point about this spot:  the Bellagio water show goes off right in front of you .. which is dope.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very disappointing.  More of a turn the tables fast food feel.   Four of us for dinner  two good dinners  two fails.    Sommelier - Fail. Popped in gave a recommendation so fast and was gone. No wine order placed???  I ordered wine from the waiter  Sommelier came back once he saw what I ordered  to serve it.  Price on the wine list wasn't what was charged to the bill.    A far cry from our first vist years ago.  Was much better then.  Overall bad experience. Had way better food and service at other restaurants in the area.  A waste of $500.00 and an 1 1/2 hours. Over rated!!!  Try finding this place on Yelp - Todd??? They would probably have more poor reviews if the average consumer could find them on Yelp.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Place has gone down hill.  Total tourist trap for deep wallets and/or suckers.  The ones in NY and Boston are fantastic.  To be fair  service was excellent.  That's about it.  Food was bland at best.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My fiance and I went to OLiVES recently for our anniversary. We've been here multiple times and this time it was the absolute most romantic dinner because of our server Paul. If anyone has a chance to come to this restaurant  ask for Paul and he'll treat you with the upmost respect! Paul will take care of you and go out of his way to make your visit the best. I will come back always asking for Paul
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hands down  my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas!!!! Located in the Via Bellagio Promenade  this Mediterranean-style establishment has outdoor seating with view of their remarkable Bellagio Fountain as a backdrop! It's so romantic.  Their bread alone would make me fly/drive/run back here in an instant. They have two kinds of bread and they serve it with a smorgasbord of olive spreads. OMG!!! I knew i loved olives  but it wasn't until I ate here that I realized how much my love for them would grow.  I would have been content eating the bread and olive spreads alone  but the waiter urged us to order an entree. We ordered the Ricotta Ravioli and Fried Sea Scallops. The food just MELTS in your mouth  the combination of fried sea scallops and their rosemary mashed potatoes and veggies - oh my  my mouth waters just remembering it.  My reason for the -1 Star?? I ended up getting a little sick through dinner  I don't think it was from the food itself because no one else got sick  but it put a tiny damper on my night.  Regardless  it is my goal to return to Vegas and eat here once again!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We have been going to Olives for years. Nice spot to watch the fountains. Restaurant could use an update. We stopped in for drinks and an appetizer. Menu choices were ok.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is a nice middleground restaurant for Las Vegas. It's not ridiculously expensive  but the food is delicious enough to constitute fine dining. It's not insanely opulent  but if you get the right table  you can watch the Bellagio fountains and the decor is quite lovely. It's not a scene-y place  but by merit of being in the Bellagio  the majority of the people surrounding you are swank. I'd recommend Olives for lunch more than for dinner. The salads and flatbreads and burgers are all really delicious  but strike me more as lunch food than as dinner food  especially with all the other dining options around Las Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate here with family during a trip to Las Vegas  we stayed at the Bellagio and had some coupons to eat here. We decided to try it out.  The food was delicious. Service was friendly. Atmosphere is great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Highly recommended by several people to us! I'll pass along the same advice- eat here and eat outside over looking the Bellagio water fountains.  Service is top notch  food is wonderful and the evening will be very romantic! Make a reservation!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We ate at 6 different restaurants during our stay and this one was not great. There was a wait to get in  the waiters were very flustered- forget to bring our butter etc.  the flavor of the food wasnt unique at all. The prawns and steak were average. The only good thing was the passion fruit martini.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'm only giving this place a 2 because of its location  service was ok and food was gross. Worst tuna tartare I've ever had and oysters wrapped in beef carpaccio was horrid. It all looks and sounds great until it gets to your mouth. I hate being mean but....what the $u!k??? Not going back. I'm rarely ever picky and like all kinds of food so if I'm irked by it then you know it's bad.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've been waiting a long time to eat here and planned on asking my girlfriend to marry me here after we ate.  Unfortunately everything was mediocre and I had to change plans.  The service was okay and they did allow us to only pay corkage for a wine they carried at the restaurant.  But the sald was weak  mostly full of croutons.  Her fish and my scallops were good  not great.  It was warm in the place and the bench for our table was way too low for the height of the table.  Nothing great here...go to Michael Mina's or twenty other better places.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Only thing good about this place is the view of the bellagio fountain show.  Our waiter was strange and kept calling us girls which I felt was rude at best. Ordered a pork chop and pasta. The food came out in 5 minutes  making me think the food is not cooked to order. The food is extremely expensive and of poor quality. Yuck.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is my absolute to-go everytime I'm in Vegas. I don't ever eat but their cocktails are bomb. You're gonna pay $15/cocktail on the strip but these drinks are totally worth it. 6 oz. and delicious!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place has 5 star service and 5 star food!  I ordered the Free Range Chicken  soooo good! I ate 3/4th of my meal already but i noticed my chicken breast came out really dry. I let them know and they made a new one for me  within like 5 mins they plated a  new one on its own  and cooked perfectly.   During the appetizers I couldn't eat the bread so they brought me a side of carrots and cucumbers so I can enjoy the olive dip. Get CHRIS as your server he's bitchin!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I made a reservation for a friend's birthday and went through the Bellagio concierge.  I had tried to make my reservation on the restaurant website but it said I had to call.  I should have done it through OpenTable b/c I never have problems with them.  The concierge had told me the dress was business casual and men cannot wear shorts  but when we were seated  I saw plenty of men wearing shorts  so that was a little irritating.   Our dinner was great though!!!  I had ordered a dirty martin  but there was barely any olive juice in it  so I asked for more on the side.  For our appetizer  we got the charcuterie board  which was so good!!  The pickles were the best part!! They also give you really good bread and olive tapenade which was excellent.  For my entree  I had the seafood risotto  which was so good.  I probably shouldn't have eaten all the bread because I was getting really full  but I managed to eat almost all of my entree.  I also tried the tenderloin which was excellent!!  My friends also ordered the scallops for their meal  which they say was really good as well!!  We were really full for dessert  but we were celebrating a birthday  so we somehow ordered 3 desserts for 5 people!!  They did put a candle on one of the desserts  so that was nice.   We tried the banana tiramisu  the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the cookie butter creme brulee.  All of which were wonderful!!!!  We couldn't stop eating even though we were so stuffed!!!!    Overall  the dinner was great and I definitely recommend this place!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very slow service. Need to improve services. Food takes long time to come and also customer service is very poor. We have to keep waiting for everything. Would not recommend to stop by just to see fountain.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We arrived at 7:30pm for our reservation at 8pm and they were able to seat us early which was really nice. I ordered the beef carpaccio for a starter and the spaghetti and meatballs (one of the specials). My husband ordered the onion soup as a starter and a mushroom pasta dish. I also ordered a glass of wine while my husband had sparkling water. The beef carpaccio was NOT my favorite. If you look at others pictures on here  it's accurate. It's quite big so if you are eating with a vegetarian you are on your own! It had a weird fried polenta cake under salad and then all of the beef was on top of that. I love when beef carpaccio is served with balsamic  capers  etc... but this didn't even taste that great. My waitress asked me what I thought of it and I said  ""it's big."" She said it's actually only 2oz of meat. It just didn't taste that great and the presentation was off-putting. My husband liked his soup but it was pretty small and he would have probably been happier with a larger bowl (it was definitely a case of size reversal!). They do bring you a basket of bread with olives and 2 types of olive tapenade. The bread was quite good. The spaghetti and meatballs weren't that great either. The meatballs were the best part and had a lot of flavor as there were two types of meat ground together but there was nothing spectacular about the spaghetti or the sauce. I looked for salt at one point but none was to be had and I didn't want to risk offending the chef by asking for some. After the unappetizing starter  I was not that interested anyway and ended up wasting a lot of food since we were in a hotel and didn't have a fridge to take it back to even if I wanted to. My husband said his meal wasn't that great either. The price for 2 starters  2 entrees  1 glass of wine and 2 bottles of sparkling wine came out to $180 with tip. That was the most disappointing part. 2 stars are for the great service we had. We loved our waitress and the other servers. They were super attentive and kind. Save your money and go elsewhere!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the best dinner experience I've had in Vegas and we're already planning on going back. Service was fantastic - I requested to sit on the patio and although we were seated out there we wanted to be next to the balcony so as soon as a table got up we asked our server if we could move there and he moved us immediately.   We got the buffalo chicken flatbread (seasonal) and split the Ravioli and Scallops - all were phenomenal.   Being able to watch several of the shows from the fountains was amazing and impressive.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Maybe I expected too much because last time was so good. But that was a long time ago. Maybe ordered wrong things. I don't know  but very disappointing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,WOW! this place did NOT disappoint even though I had REALLY high expectations.  8 of us made reservations on a Saturday night for dinner and we were promptly seated.  They give you bread to start off with and two different olive spreads.  We also ordered a couple of appetizers: tuna tartare  crispy fried eggplant parmesan reavioli  and parmesan french fries & requested it with truffle oil.  ALL of these  including the bread  were delicious.  Of the three  my favorite was the french fries glazed with the truffle oil!   For my entree  I ordered the pan-seared jumbo sea scallops which was heavenly! The scallops were perfect  the risotto was perfect  and the greens were amazing as well! haha  My other friends ordered the Pan Roasted Alaskan Halibut  Ribeye  and the petite shrimp tagliarini.  Everyone raved about their dishes.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Absolutely wonderful experience.  The scenery is spectacular.  You overlook the Bellagio water show and lake.  The food is consistently excellent.  We have been here 3 times  and each meal was magical.  The service is always on point.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beef carpaccio was unbelievable. The service was disorganized but overall a great meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was definitely excited to eat at this place for the first time (bout a month ago) since the place was always packed! but unfortunately I also got food poisoned when i ate there...their beef carpaccio (huge!) was amazing but their butternut squash tortellini on the other hand was not good...it was too rich and way too sweet...i think that dish was the dish that got me sick that night...  There are so many other good restaurants and fine dining establishments in vegas but Olives to me isnt one of them...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Looked like a wait  but after my wife said a few things to the server we were seated very fast. We had a very attentive server. We had drinks  both of us had the same thing. Very delish and had some kick so one was enough. For our food we had the Butternut Tortelli  Watermelon salad  and the grilled Squid & Octopus w/ chickpeas. Simply put  it was our best meal in Las Vegas. Decent portions and wonderful flavours. Fresh tasting. I could have eaten the Squid & Octopus all day. Love this place. Now to find out if there is one close to San Diego
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English's Olives is located in Bellagio. We didn't make a reservation  so unfortunately  we did not have a good view of the fountains from our table  so keep this in mind if you are planning a trip! Despite the lack of a reservation  we were seated quickly and our server was very attentive.  I got the fig & prosciutto flatbread and it was delicious! They have a nice wine list as well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I wanted to grab a quick glass of wine around 4:30pm last night. Unfortunately Picasso's was closed  so we walked back to Olives because we wanted to be able to watch the fountain as we sat.  We were told that the seating in the bar was open  but the restaurant wasn't open yet. Except every seat at the bar was full. We asked if we could grab a two top table just across from the bar - just to have a place to sit.   I can't even explain the response we got - and how much of an inconvenience our simple request was. We were told that the bartender wouldn't serve us there  so I offered to order and pay at the bar but still wanted to sit.  We have been staying at the Vdara and have been treated with nothing but respect and gratitude. The run around we got from the staff at Olives and the rude attitudes we received was completely unacceptable. The way that we were treated was so unacceptable - especially for a place that was empty except for the bar seating. They clearly do not care about customer service. We walked straight to the Vdara and received exceptional customer service. I highly recommend avoiding this place if you want to have a good dining experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First let me say I'm a Boston Olive's fan of many years so I was apprehensive about the Las Vegas  venue but I'm pleased to say it was unfounded.  From the seating through the desert Olive's met our expectations.  Beautifully plated salads and entrees  knowledgeable waitstaff  a lovely view and an accommodating kitchen made for an outstanding meal.  With so many restaurants in LV where price does not necessarily indicate quality  it was reassuring to find the high standards of the Boston location were upheld and perhaps exceeded.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We were celebrating out 33rd Anniversary! The meal was outstanding including a special dessert.  The best part of the evening was our server Paul Anthony!   We lucked out when we sat in his section!    Paul was awesome his persona says ""I'm happy I like my job and I truly love people"".   His attention to our needs and the details were just great!   We were able to observe how he handled other tables around us and it was wonderful Paul made every table feel special! Thank you Paul  You made our evening  special."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Came here for dinner this past weekend. To be honest  after eating at all the other Bellagio restaurants (Sensi  Le Cirque  Picasso)  I didn't expect as much here but was very pleasantly surprised and proven wrong...sort-of.  The reason why I say sort-of is because we got entrees  and whereas the entrees were good  I would skip them next time and just do all appetizers because the appetizers were a lot better.  I would say overall  this place is 3-stars for entrees and maybe 4 or even 4.5 for appetizers/salads/dessert.  We came here as a party of 2 for a Sunday 6pm dinner. They were already jam-packed  so definitely make reservations!  We ordered the following:  APPETIZERS * Tuna Tartare - Stellar! I love how it's not super spicy like how some other places make it  so you can actually taste the freshness of the tuna but still infused with the wonderful Asian-inspired flavors of the tartare. * Pan Roasted Foie Gras Steak - Not the best I've had. The Foie Gras was a bit thin  creeping on the side of being overcooked (a bit too charred on some edges)  and it was accompanied by an apple compote crepe that makes the whole dish feels like foie gras over apple pie.  SALADS * Beet Salad - Loved it! I'm a fan of beet salads and this one did not disappoint. * Beef Carpaccio - FANTASTIC! My favorite dish here (although the Tuna Tartare comes very close). I had high hopes for it when we ordered it  and then when it came out  it literally looked like a disassembled lasagna or something--I remember thinking ""OMG  we shouldn't have ordered this""  but looks deceive! It tasted heavenly! Very fresh and tender beef and the sauces and flavors were perfect. There's a lump in the middle which is the greens under the bed of carpaccio.  ENTREES * Jumbo Sea Scallops - It was sort of a hit and miss for me. I LOVE sea scallops  so I think that was the only thing going for the dish for me. But it was a bit overcooked (I prefer it more tender  lightly seared  but this one--the edges were getting rough) and a bit too salty (I was trying to scrape off the sauce  which was a bit overwhelming). * Cast Iron Norwegian Salmon - Very good. Better than the scallops and very enjoyable dish  but the appetizers were still better =)  DESSERT * Vanilla Souffle - I'm a sucker for souffle  so even though we were chalk-full  I couldn't pass it up  so we ordered one to share. And this one was executed beautifully and I'm happy that I stuffed myself for it =)  Bread (complimentary) was really good. There was a mix of the crispy flatbread  a sweet honey crusted bun  and some cut focaccia pieces. They weren't warn  but they were definitely fresh and we liked the focaccia and honey breads the best. Service was pretty good. They were a bit busy  we had to ask for another bottle of water twice  but overall  it was excellent."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was our second time here and were just as impressed as the first time! Raul the bartender set the bar high! And we were greeted the second time with zack Andrew and Reggie! We stopped in before a show to get a great martini and a light appetizer! The flatbread pizza are delicious! We didn't have time for the restraunt but it is busy especially outdoor patio looking the bellagio fountains! Reservations recommend! Zack and Reggie you are great mixologists and very creative and friendly! Cheers!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nicole  the Manager  helped me plan a wedding shower dinner for my daughter and her guests. I spite of several changes  Nicole accommodated our requests effortlessly. Rick  our server was amazing  as was Adam Pongracic  the Sommelier.  The Champagne was chilled and table-side  waiting to be poured for our toast to the bride-to-be. We had a lovely table overlooking the dancing fountains. The food is always great and the flatbread was a big hit before we ordered dinner. I know why we always return to Olives when we visit Las Vegas  because we feel like guests in their home!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So glad that we ate here! Everything was amazing  from the view  the drinks  the food  and the service!! Because of the reviews  we had the beef carpaccio  and it was wonderful! My husband and I had never eaten it before  and we both loved it! I had the butternut squash pasta  and my husband had the scallops - both second to none! We've eaten at many high end restaurants  and this was just such a fun atmosphere! Make sure to request to sit on the patio - the Bellagio fountains make the experience! So wonderful and so romantic! Will definitely be dining here during our next Vegas trip!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had an amazing meal at Olive's last night. I usually stop at the bar for a drink when in town and always enjoy the vibe  so decided to try the full Olive's experience this time.   We were fortunate to get a table on the terrace and watched the watershow throughout the meal.   Patrick the server and Tammie the sommelier were attentive and fun. Exceptional service.   Highly recommend the portobello flatbread  the carpaccio and the butternut squash ravioli. The wild boar papardelle pasta special was superb too.   Jordan Chardonnay and Cabernet were featured wines that night and paired well with everything we ordered.   Looking forward to going back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I made reservations at this place because I wanted to sit on the patio  but of course we get there and there is no patio seating for another hour.  We had a show to catch  so we settled for the inside.  Our waiter was very nice  and yes the carpaccio is the best and biggest I have ever had.  My husband and I shared the ravioli.  It was descent and more than enough for the both of us.  If you love olives  do the dirty martini.  The bleu cheese stuffed olives are off the hook!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had a business dinner here and the service was top notch and the carpaccio was one of the most flavorful I've had (but not so over powering that it takes away from the beauty of tasting the beef) Prices were very fair for the quality and service received. If you are lucky enough to get a seat on the patio you can enjoy the view of the Bellagio fountains. I would reccomend the patio on cooler nights as it is very warm to sit outdoors in the summer and early fall.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Took my gf here for our anniversary.  Sat out in the balcony overlooking the Bellagio fountains. It was during the winter but the heat lamps kept us warm so that wasn't a problem.  Very romantic setting and one of the best places to see the Bellagio fountain show.  Food was good (pricy too) and the server was very friendly.  Good to take friends (who won lots of $$ at the casinos)  date  coworkers (on company expense)  and customers (on customer's company expense?!)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had dinner reservations here on Saturday for my birthday. We were seated right away. I called ahead of time to see if we could get a table with a view of the Bellagio fountains  to which we were told we would need to come in get on a waiting list and told what time to come back... I think not. If we have reservations already I don't understand why I would want to be put on a waiting list  but since it was Valentine's Day weekend I understand they were fully booked. Any who  this is where my rant ends- everything else from there on out was great. We were a group of five and we had a decent table. They brought out bread for the table  which was yummy. We all got different dishes to try out and they all tasted wonderful. I would definitely recommend either the salmon/lobster pasta dish  or the Gnocchi dish. I ordered a margarita  which was SO watered down it basically tasted like lemonade with barely any alcohol content.  For dessert we had the chocolate lava cake which was delectable.  Overall it was a great experience. definitely glad I picked this place for my birthday.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We like Olives for lunch -- usually you can walk in & be seated.  Check to see if you can sit outside  but it was 122' when we were there in early July  so inside was just lovely.  Love  love  love the Beef Carpaccio.  Enough to share for lunch with the bread & olive spread & tapenade.  Great wine by the glass selection.  Love the iPad wine list.  Easy repeat for me.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The place was jammed packed for lunch  Barack Obama was in the house. Yeah he was at the Bellagio for a fund raiser. We had been looking forward to trying Olives for quite some time. We decided to share a few appetizers  and ordered the following: Todd's ceasar's salad  just OK after the Whisk n Ladle  ceasar in La Jolla. Grilled squid and octopus  pretty tasty with chickpeas.  Meatball and eggplant flatbread  we thought it was a dish not a flatbread but was tasty. Fig and prosciutto flatbread excellent. Portabella flatbread with mushroom  truffle oil  fontina cheese  red onion. That was quite tasty.  I 'm hoping the next time I go to Vegas I'll have dinner at olives  maybe just a light dinner so I can still eat somewhere else. Cant help it I'm a porker.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The atmosphere is very inviting and if you can snag a seat on the patio add 2 more stars.  However  we sat inside and we were not wowed by the food.   17 dollars for two small heads of romaine lettuce  anchovies and store bought croutons was really over the top. My hubby's truffle burger was very good  but 21 dollars?  I should add that the bread basket with olives and tapenade were great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Where do I start. This place is beautiful. And great food.  Great service. That's it. We didn't make reservations. We just walked up. I'm not sure if it was because of being a bellagio VIP or they weren't to busy this night.   Such a beautiful intimate setting.  It's right behind the bellagio fountains. So you get to see the show every few minutes. Everything we orders was so good. I'm not positive on everything we order because I'm righting this a week later. I know I had a flatbread pizza and spouse had a plate with chicken and green mash. Oh I wish I knew the name because it was delicious!  Our waitress was pretty good. She could've been a bit more tentative but everyone who came by the table made sure we were ok with everything. Including the gentleman who filled our water cups and the person who brought out our food. I will return to this restaurant and recommend it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My Favorite lunch spot in Vegas.  Overlooking the Bellagio Fountains so try to get a seat on the patio!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So I was tottering between three and four stars  so I'll just make a list. But  I'll go ahead and run with four since it was my birthday dinner  and all in all it turned out to be a pretty nice  romantic experience.  The Positives:  Bread Basket with tapenade. The bread basket was amazing. I'm not a huge fan of olives (I know  I know...I'm eating at a restaurant called 'Olives.' I get the irony people.) but the green tapenade was actually pretty delish.  GREAT wine suggestion from the waiter - and great waiter. I only wish I could remember what the heck that wine was. We ordered a bottle  and while it was one of the least expensive on the menu  it was totally yummy. Another bonus was that the waiter didn't try and upsell us on some ridiculously marked up version of something I can get at the Kroger for $16. Cheers to you  my friend.   Beef Carpacchio...UM holy heaven Hallelujah! This was freaking amazing  and pretty dang big  too  for an appetizer. And speaking of big...  Portion sizes. My biggest pet peeve is paying a crapton of money for a tiny amount of food (unless  of course the food is just ridiculously amazing). These plates  including the appetizer  were HUGE. Neither of us finished our entrees and it wasn't for lack of trying.   The atmosphere is nice  upscale  but there's definitely not a strict dress code. There were people dressed up  but I also spotted a fanny pack or two. But hey  it's Vegas...just kind of have to go with the tourist-y flow there.   The Neutral: I was super excited about the Lobster Bolognese (sp?) but it turned out to be a little too rich for my taste buds. Plus  the giant lobster tail that topped it was a tiny bit tough...I mean  it's hard to complain about lobster tail but I guess I was just expecting a wee bit more. The actual handmade pasta was pretty damn amazing though.  The bf ordered the duck special (some sort of duck ravioli maybe?)  he enjoyed it but didn't rave about it. I had a bite or two  and while I'm used to duck being a gamier-type meat  this seemed pretty greasy  even for duck. He still ate it though  of course.  The Bad:  Yeah  yeah  yeah. I get they don't take reservations for the patio. I'm sure it's probably logistically impossible. But seeing as we called MONTHS in advance to make our reservations on the reco of a friend of ours  made our reservations for extremely early in the evening (either 6 or 6:15  I can't remember) and THEN called earlier in the day to see if there anything they could do...I don't know. I'm sure they can't make everyone happy  it just would have been nice  considering it was not only our first time in Vegas  but the patio was the only reason we made my birthday reservation there. Blah blah blah. I know  I'm probably just being a brat.  The tables inside are a bit close together  at least where we sat. In all honesty it didn't really bother me personally  but you could definitely hear other tables conversations...and they could hear ours  so much so that they wished me a happy birthday and doted on the fact that my boyfriend bought me a kindle and how much they loved theirs. It was very sweet  of course  but if we'd gotten sat next to annoying or not nice people  the experience may have been different. Just something to keep in mind.  The hostess was a little bit of a cold fish. But hey  everyone can't be having a great day all the time.   I know it seems like a lot of neutrals/negatives  but I have to reiterate that the whole experience really turned out fun and romantic  and a great place to celebrate a birthday. So...yay to Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I do not think Las Vegas has many great or even good restaurants.  We were not sure where to eat and settled for a place connected to our hotel.  We chose Olives and I honestly expected another mediocre and overpriced meal.  We waited for the patio and that was definitely the way to go.  We got a great view of the strip  Sinatra was in the background  and there was the Bellagio water show.  Oh and by the way my steak was outstanding.  This was one of the better dining experience of my life.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant was friggin fantastic. We went here for dinner and I can honestly say it was in the top 5 best meals I've ever had.  They bring out several kinds of breads with different olive spreads - so good.  The service was amazing. They really dote over you and make you feel like royalty.  The food - exquisite. From the steak to the Lobster Mac N Cheese  we were in heaven.  The VIEW  OH THE VIEW!!!!! We had a seat right by the window overlooking the fountains...it was heaven. So beautiful. And we stayed for hours  weren't rushed out at all.  Can't wait to go back. Everything was top notch. This restaurant is excellent.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My coworkers and I just had dinner here last night. It is so nice to dine on someone elses dime  I love expense accounts.  This is the first restaurant I have ever been to that has a sommelier. I was pretty impressed!   The restaurant itself was pretty nice. It had a nice view of the water show in front of the Bellagio. But watching mall goers on the opposite end is not very appealing.  I ordered the scallops  and my group and I ordered the portabella flatbread to share. It was delicious.  The only reason I'm giving this four out five stars is that I don't think I'd spend my own money here  unless I was a high roller. Nice food can be found in less expensive restaurants on the strip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had dinner with a rather large birthday group  but the servers were very attentive throughout the evening. We had a window table so we had a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains.   Ralph was knowledgeable of the menu and made some excellent suggestions of wine for the table.  The bread basket was yummy and the riesling wine was delicious.   I ordered the tenderloins and my boyfriend ordered the free-range chicken with a side of truffle risotto. The tenderloin was amazing. Super tender and juicy and oh so flavorful. The carmelized onion mash was smooth and creamy. Perfect presentation for a superb dish. The chicken had a great herb flavor and was not dry at all. The best part was the pesto mash underneath (I am so trying that next time I make mashed potatoes). Truffle risotto was as expected. I mean anything truffle is yummy  right. The risotto had a nice consistency  not too mushy or undercooked.  Really  really wanted to try the desserts but way too full. Next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My girlfriend and I are always looking out for Celeb Chef restaurants. So when we were looking for a dinner place for her bday  this one stuck out. (well maybe because we saw his other operation on Chef Wanted on Food Network). So we thought we would give it a try.  We were impressed. It might have been one of the best meals we've had.  We started with the sausage flat bread  which was a little spicy for her  but i loved it. :) then the main courses we split and had the Chicken Gnocci and the Short Rib Parpadelli. amazing is all i have to say. Also  we seriously contemplated taking home a bag of the Chocolate Walnut Bread. mmmm.    I made a reservation online and noted it was her bday. after our main course they brought out a nice plate with 3 different cake balls on them with ""happy birthday"" written out on it. Nice touch.  We will come back here again."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Ruined Anniversary  In a nutshell  If Cheesecake Factory had an gorgeous older sister her name would be Olives. The exceptional food was the saving grace. But don't choose this place for a special occasion and reservations aren't taken for the patio. And the hostess didn't even have our reservation so we had a terrible table!   5-stars for food. 2-stars for the crowded  dark  indoor seating area and 2 stars for not going out of their way to make it a 5-star night on my 10-Year Anniversary!   I don't know why I bothered dressing up  people on this night were VERY casual and I was in my nice dress and high heels  I felt a bit overdressed...  Pasta dishes start at $26 and go up to $41 for Lobster Carbonara.  Then by the time you order a $10 cocktail and pricey bottled water  your bill for two people will be easily in the $200 range. That doesn't include dessert or salad.    Service was a 4-star. It was a speedy dinner  they turned over these tables quickly. So if you're looking for a lingering affair  this isn't your place.   The waiter was helpful but dinner ended in like an hour.  Most of my dinner was spent looking at the waiter's station even though I was seated in front of a window (but not next to it).   It was hard seeing new patrons being taken to sit on the patio while I was inside ""celebrating"" a special occasion. Sour grapes?  Yep! I spent my night staring at two old ladies who were at least next to the window. Then we sat next to a busy aisle so waiters were walking by every second. It was like two clowns short of a circus.    Don't come here for a special night  too risky and too expensive to pay for indoor seating.   We ordered the escargot and it came out really fast-almost too fast.  It wasn't warm enough but had all the flavors you would expect (garlic) to create the perfect dragon breath that you'll have after eating it.   For my entree I ordered the Seabass and it was absolutely amazing.  I'm a huge fan of the Butterfish entree at Roy's (one of my favorite all-time fish entrees with the same consistency) and this entree exceeded above and beyond.  It was served with a mushroom risotto and some spinach and the sauces...wow every bite was truly magical I really  really  loved it.    My husband had a steak with some lobster croquettes and also tasted fabulous and well prepared.    He ordered some crazy blueberry martini that the waiter recommended  but to me it tasted like a bar of soap.   I had a glass of Pink Moscato and wished I had ordered the whole bottle just to get me through dinner for choosing this place on such a special occasion.    The waiter brought out a nice dish that said HAPPY ANNIVERSARY written in chocolate on a plate with some truffles and it was very nice.    Overall  never coming back."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the second time we ate at Olives. The fresh bread and olive spread were excellent. We really enjoyed our meal as well. The service was great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had an absolutely incredible experience at Olives. Every dish that we had was perfect and tasted amazing. The cocktails were also delicious. The pastas were incredibly fresh and flavorful. The pizzas were awesome. The service was perfect and very hospitable. The restaurant overlooks the Bellagio fountains. If you make reservations  ask for the patio so that you can enjoy the show. I would vote Olives as one of the best meals that I have ever had.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The seating was excellent. I requested the patio when I made the reservations. We got seated right next to the stone railing and got the prime view of the water shows.  The food was not so great. The folie gras was overcooked and seared black around the edges. BAD! The medium rare steak was medium well done. I think I could've gotten better food at a buffet. Definitely not recommend for the food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We stopped in here for a bit between playing and real dinner...We sat at the bar and were served right away.  The special peach puree martini was a big winner.  Though I dont like olives  the tampenades served with the bread were really great.  I loved the bread selection and I'll def be back for the peach martini..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I come here fairly often for lunch and dinner. I always have a good time here and the food is fantastic. The flatbreads are so yummy. Beef carpaccio is great! Their seabass and scallops here are fantastic. Chicken and steak are pretty good here too. Yeah  I do love Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Jon the bartender is easy on the eyes. Although he informed me that they no longer have Zima on draft  he DID concoct me the perfect custom cocktail. Also  did I mention he's easy on the eyes??
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my first meal on my first trip to Vegas.  My sister and I were staying at the Bellagio and just decided to try out one of the casino's places and we both heart Italian.  I had the ravioli with sausage which was very good but that is not what stole our tastebuds hearts.  It was the bread and olive spreads.  So freakin' good!  I loved the sweetness of the bread with the saltiness of the olives.  We requested more and needless to say felt we maybe should have just ordered drinks and not a full meal.    The view of the fountains really makes you feel classier than you actually are. :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place rock's   very nice dining  the prices for lunch are NOT expensive  ask for the balcony in the middle near the water  i posted a picture up on here check it out and let me know what u think. our waiter's name was scott and he was the best waiter we ever had  he is very friendly and he's funny too  the view we got of the fountains was exquisite. 5 star's and the FOOD was the best for the price and dessert we got was under $60  and be aware that u may get wet while on the balcony if the wind is blowing in the direction u are sitting  wet like a mist not drenched.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,AWESOME date place.  Took my girl here a tad bit late to wait for the patio area  but after experiencing the ambience and the food  we're definitely coming back and waiting the hour to get the patio experience. I got the butternut tortellini and my girl got the fig & prosciutto. Both were very unique in their sweet flavor. It was both fine dining and really hit the spot.  We didn't order alcohol or desert and the price turned out to be rather reasonable as far as Las Vegas restaurants go. Spent about as much as we would have on a buffet around the area.  Would definitely recommend.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view from the balcony is fantastic at night but the food was only average. You expect  more for the price.  They used to have califlower puree as a side but no more. The service was also only average.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The only thing this place has going is the view of the Bellagio fountains if you're lucky enough to score a patio table.  The food (lunch menu) was mediocre and the prices did not reflect the poor quality of food. We were seated on the patio and met business colleagues for lunch. It took forever to get our servers attention so that we could place our order. If I didn't catch her eye when I did  I think my only option would have been to throw the menus off the patio and into the water in hopes of getting somebody to come by. Once she did acknowledge us  she was pleasant and attentive enough.   I had the North Atlantic Sea Scallop which came with mushroom risotto. The risotto was very bland and scallops were adequate  but by no means mind blowing or even in the top 5 of my favorite scallop dishes. My husband had the beef tenderloin  and after sampling it  I'd say it was around 3.5 stars. The other two members of the party had grilled chicken breast and ricotta ravioli. I am guessing they enjoyed it  but not having sampled them  I can't comment on the dishes.  The bill ended up clocking in at around $110 without any drinks or appetizers. I would be ok with this if the food and service were not one step above Applebee's quality. My husband assures me that dinner here is actually good  but having not tried it  I can't say. I did see many people ordering the flatbreads  so perhaps that's the lunch item to shoot for.  I don't have any intention of returning here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place still ceases to amaze me with  their fine dishes.  They  were very accommodating and got us a nice view of water show.  They dont skimp on bread  olives and spread.  Also kind to my wife who didnt feel good.  First class place and thanks again.  Try the Beef Carpaccio..to die for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place has such an awesome view of the fountains  and that alone is worth a star in my book. If you can grab a table on the outdoor patio when it's not too hot  be sure to do so. Besides the view  the menu is pretty awesome too... especially if you like olives as much as I do!  My husband and I came here a few times during a recent trip to Vegas  both out of convenience and the fact that we like what they have to offer. Two of our visits were for lunch. I love the fact that they start the meal with bread and... Butter? Nope! Olive oil? Guess again! OLIVE TAPENADE! Are you beginning to feel my love for olives yet? ;-) I had to try their daily salad special  which just happened to be offered both days we were there and was good enough that I ordered it twice. The mix of watermelon  tomato  arugula  and feta cheese did a happy dance in my mouth! I chose two pasta dishes for my two lunch entrees... gnocchi with kalamata olives and goat cheese (super great flavors combined there) and amaretto butternut squash ravioli (sweet and savory all at the same time). My husband also enjoyed the gnocchi dish one day and went with a burger for his next meal  which he thought was delicious.   During another visit  we came for drinks and dessert. The drinks were out of this world good... a daily special of raspberry mojitos with plenty of fresh raspberries and mint muddled into the drink. For my dessert choice  I went with a refreshing sorbet. It consisted of three flavors (peach bellini  mixed berry  and melon) set on top of a dish of fresh berries... a perfect summer day treat! My husband opted for a sweet ice cream sandwich duo that looked super yum.  I'm sure we'll make a stop at Olives again in the future. The food and view are tough to beat!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our large group of sixteen were seated right on time and they were busy  so off to a good start.  This is not a quiet restaurant when its busy  so keep that in mind if you are wanting an intimate evening for two.  We had a couple of starters that included a meat and cheese tray and a flat bread pizza  both were great.  I had a house salad and loved it.  For dinner  I ordered the salmon entree which was really good and some others had the scallops which were supposed to be excellent too.  I would go back and hope for the patio seating the next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was mind-blowing! To start they had some nice hot fresh rolls and some of the best bread I've had in Vegas at the table with a delicious trio of olive spread- one green  one black. One of the best spreads I've ever tasted which was a nice alternative to your standard butter spread we are all accustomed to in this day and age.  Try the carpaccio! This was the best carpaccio I've also ever had- It was sliced perfectly over a bed of arugula accompanied by a polenta patty garnished with capers- delicious!  For my entree I ordered off the special menu where a nice bone-in filet was featured. Steak was cooked to perfection and came with a side of garlic-Parmesan fries.   Been here three times -twice solely for the carpaccio which can serve as a hearty entree if inclined. Highly recommend Olives at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was wonderful. The recommended wine was a little sweet for us  but it was good.  The food was good/very good. Creme brullee was excellent.  The prices are reasonable for the quality of food/service. The view is awesome! Definitely would be a great date place.. you can see the Bellagio fountains from the windows or the patio.  Make a reservation (just like everywhere in Vegas) and you'll be good to go!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view at Todd English's Olives is enough to make me return! We had a large group dining here and got a semi private room with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountains. We were greeted by friendly service  this incredible view  and a large wine list - we were happy :)  While we waited for the rest of our huge group to make their way to the restaurant we munched on their bread basket which was comprised of foccacia  crispy flatbread  and other home made breads. Of course these were all accompanied with olive tapenade.   To start I selected the wild Mushroom Flatbread which was comprised of mushroom puree  herb roasted portobello  red onions  fontina cheese  and my favorite  white truffle oil. This dish was super yummy and a great starter! They had a few vegetarian entree selections but for my entree I selected the Spring Pea Mezzaluna - the name itself sounded yummy and was comprised of italian mascarpone  fava beans  spring peas  asparagus  baby pea shoot salad  and truffle fontina fonduta. I thought this dish was pretty good though it didn't blow me away.  What really didn't impress me here was the service. We had all ordered individual wines and also a couple bottles of a cab to share - the waitress in her effort to get us through our bottles of cab quickly  came around and refilled my friend's half full glass of Shiraz with the cab!!!  We weren't going for a cave blend. Fail. Second  they brought all but one of our 14 dishes out at the same time. The rest of the table waited about 3 minutes for the last dish to arrive. It was kinda of tacky that they didn't bring all the dishes out together. (minus one star for service).  I also was not impressed by the dessert menu here and being at the Bellagio  we couldn't resist paying a visit to Jean Philippe to get our dessert fix instead. (minus one star for dessert).  Bottom line  although the views at Olive's are amazing  the food and service are pretty lackluster.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Restaurant Week Meal #7 (Lunch for $30.13): Appetizer: Cantaloupe Soup OR Portabello Piccata OR Caprese Tart  Entree: Roasted Breast of Chicken OR Lake Superior Whitefish OR Grilled Skirt Steak  Dessert: Coconut Caramel Cake OR Seasonal Sorbet Trio  Since I was already getting the steak  my friend opted to get a burger and truffle fries instead of doing RW. I was asked if I've tried Olives before and I haven't...we had bread service and that's when I realized why I haven't been here - I'm allergic to olives! Too late  we already placed our order.  Cantaloupe Soup: With almonds and minted creme fraiche. I like cantaloupe so this was an easy choice plus  it's different. A nice  cool and refreshing soup. It's lightly salted so it's not like eating dessert. It's best eaten with a spoon which the server didn't give me. 4/5  Grilled Skirt Steak: Came with Italian sausage mashed potatoes  roasted Brussels sprouts  Pinot Noir reduction topped with watercress salad. I love steak but this one was not that good especially if they don't give you a steak knife. 3.5/5  Coconut Caramel Cake: Came with chocolate malt ice cream and coconut brittle. I'm not a fan of coconut but I was not in the mood for sorbet either.  The ice cream was very good. The cake was like a deconstructed macaroon. Not too bad. 4/5  Olive's Burger and Truffle Fries: Dressings on the side: pickles  tomatoes and onions. This usually comes with Parmesan Fries but my friend got it substituted with Truffle Fries. His first burger was cooked medium-well...and dry so he sent it back.  The second burger was perfectly medium-rare. Tasty and juicy. The fries were perfect! 4.5/5  Despite the utensil snafu  Olives has good things going on.  The burger and truffle fries...yum! They have a nice view of the Miracle Mile and the Fountains of Bellagio if you sit at the patio. There are birds waiting for a free meal but they're not pesky.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Onion bread is incredible! If you like olives you'll enjoy what they serve free of charge prior to the meal. The salmon with wild rice and asparagus was very tasty and cooked well. Highly recommend sitting outside on the patio  unless the fountain show is on- then you may be getting wet. Overall a good experience. Food at lunch time was timely. Expect to spend $20-35 on your entree.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Always one of our favorites!! Never disappointing and always busy... so make reservations!! Forever changing menu of delicious creations  great wine list and predictably attentive service. YUMMY!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,After dining at a few places last week in Vegas I wasn't too impressed with this place. The waiter was not on his game. We ordered wine to start. Never received it until we asked for it  he never checked on us and we sat in front of our finished dinner plates for 20 min before they were removed. Ordered the sausage ravioli which was meh..ok. The caesar salad was huge  big enough for two. That was really good. Ordered the hazelnut souffle which was very underdone ..it deflated immediately . For prices like that I expected to at least be treated much better than that. I will not recommend or return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Try ordering the flat bread and the beef scarpoccio and mix the two atthe table. It was just great..great service too. Share your Odets  it can be allot of food
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow  I just realized I never wrote a review for this place!!! We came here in 2007 with family for Thanksgiving since we were all staying at the Bellagio so we made reservations for Thanksgiving day. There were 14 of us so we had our own long table in the back with the view of the strip. We ordered turkey  stuffing and cranberry sandwiches  mashed potatoes  lots of Thanksgiving sides and pies for us to all share. Our waiters were very accommodating and we were pretty loud but they seemed to like us very lively that day!   Our bill was over $2 000 but then again it was the 14 of us and I'm sure our waiters didn't mind the nice tip they got from it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was good  but not great!  The cocktails were great! I went for lunch and the lunch menu was good.  I ordered Grilled Chicken Breast with fingerling potatoes  broccolini  Madeira chicken jus  roasted red onion  watercress.  I ask for a substitute of  truffle fries  but you could barely taste the flavor of the truffles on the fries.  This was a bit disappointing because 1. I love to eat truffle fries and 2. I have heard such great reviews about this restaurant and the waiter highly recommended the truffle fries to me. The location of course  is fabulous connected to Bellagio Hotel which is like a city within a city.  The hostess  manager and wait staff were not only professional  but they were so warm and welcoming.  I was eating alone and wanted a seat on the terrace and they said there would be a 30 minute wait.  I said I could wait  but within 5 minutes they came back and seated me.  It was a beautiful location to have lunch  the drinks were fabulous and the staff was top notch.  My meal was okay  but I would go back and try a different dish.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The lunch prices were reasonable and there were plenty of choices for a pescetarian.  It's strange in Vegas how the prices for a Sizzler-esque meal are almost the same as nicer places like this one.  The lobster roll was all lobster and no filler  just a light sauce over the pieces.   Our waitress was nice and let me substitute the side of beans for a salad.  If I had paid $50 for dinner  I'd probably have more to say about the food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I am deducting a star from my previous review.  Set scene: Saturday night  my friend's birthday dinner  Olives is busy  noisy  and full of patrons. Our six-person party is seated in the main dining area and our menus are give to us  as well as the iPad wine menu (so fancy huh). I swept through the wine menu  but wasn't sure on what to have. I inquired with our waiter who seemed not so keen to help me decide so I had to goad him with a few clues and actually ended up taking the advice of my friend seated next to me while the waiter just nodded and took the order.  Next came dinner; although the food was very good I feel as though the prices are somewhat askew. Not on everything  but definitely on the Grilled Sirloin my husband ordered for $49. The steak was minuscule  and yes  I realize plating and stacking food is a cute and fancy and all  but I don't care how you stacked this thing it was still not big enough to justify being $49. I must admit though that my husband missed out on half the dish as he requested the peas  onions  and roquefort cream be removed from the dish. (Yes  this is me sighing unpleasantly as he explains this to the server. Ah  my picky husband...)  I had the Ricotta Ravioli  actually a very decadent dish with the perfect amount of raviolis and sweet Italian sausage. It was the perfect amount of food  and the price was solid.  Foie gras... our table split this as an app. This time around I felt as though the foie gras was not as good. It was a bit stringy  and honest to goodness I was a bit miffed at the lighting in the dining room because I couldn't SEE the appetizer as it was on the other side of the table from me.   For dessert... my husband and I shared the Pumpkin-pie-like-custard-like dessert creation. The name escapes me now  but dang it was PUMPKINY. I had a bite and was basically floored by how much it tasted like pumpkin.   Overall... I plan to head elsewhere for birthday or anniversary or night-out dining in Vegas. Although I do like Olives I think there are some places that do the special night out dining better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Ugh  I'm going to look like a complete hypocrite....... I generally DON'T like the food here  but I continue to suggest this place for business lunches/dinners  take family/friends in town here (probably primarily to sit outside)  and even... eat here myself when I shop at the Bellagio (in my defense  it's usually around lunch when I shop here and I'm always FAMISHED when 1-2 rolls around.. it's just convenient).  I guess my biggest issue is that I don't know how to categorize the cuisine.  It's got a little bit of everything  but it's called  ""Olives""?  Often  there's something curried  something sriracha'd  something greek  something ""mediterranean""  something with all french touches... It's just confusing.  Besides that  in the million and one times I've been here  I've run into some of the most inexcusable food screw ups.. like  totally overdone-dehydrated-DEAD parmesan fries  meat being over done  excessive spices.  Well  it really is a pretty restaurant  and the outdoor seating is great  with the water show (FYI- everyone both outside and IN run out when the show comes on and flood the balcony)  the music  air  it really is nice to eat there.  I've never had an unpleasant experience with the service.  It is a nice restaurant... BUT  I just feel like the food  while decent  really isn't all that spectacular.  In other words  I recommend lunch here- like a later lunch- 1ish (the portions are HUGE)  not dinner (although an early dinner brings an ideal time to sit outside).  I've had just about everything on the menu and I like:  Calamari - nice and crisp  but I like calamari from anywhere  including some dingy Jersey highway diners at 2am. Tuna tartare - the cucumbers and crispy shrimp make it. grilled squid & octopus- tahini like dressing was tasty. fried ravioli - A. it's fried  and B. the SAUCE was great. mushroom/truffle oil flatbread- it's HUGE and really awesome. filet with curry-yogurt sauce- great sauce. seasonal creme brulee (passionfruit or coconut..something tropical)- perfect portion and sweetness  Things that have been a total disaster:  Parmesan fries crab fritters..... bean puree and mango salsa???  yuck. beef carpaccio  Like I said  I'm always taking people here  and it's never a miss as far as I know. Try to sit outside if it's season.  xx"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Solidly four stars.    Not a cheap date  but expect well executed Mediterranean-inspired food  creative drink  and efficient service in a wonderful space  overlooking the amazing Bellagio water show outside.  It can be loud inside  but the expectation should be to sit outside on the patio on all but inclement conditions.  It's worth the wait  as the water show is spectacular and elevates the Olives experience.  Make reservations early.  Don't wait until the day-of if you want prime time  and note that patio seating is first come  first served  even with a reservation.  The drink menu and wine list are on a balky  awkward iPad device.  The list is impressive  for sure  and yes  they are pretty pictures and great descriptions.  But Olives' use of technology for technology's sake is overly complicated  imoho.  KISS.  Parking at the Bellagio is free if you self park  though the hike from the garage through the casino and on to the restaurant may be a bit much for women in heels.  Valet or a cab drop off at the Bellagio front door is a shorter walk.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Was in Vegas during Labor Day weekend and to my glee it's LV restaurant week too?! I saw Todd English on Top Chef as a judge and with the location just on the edge of the lake of the Bellagio fountains  I was in!  Made a reservation the day before hoping to get the first seating. We scored a table on the patio and got to watch a fountain show  cool! Food roundup (3 course lunch for $20)  Bread basket: Yummy flatbread and carmelized onion focaccia with green and black olive tapenades with whole olives as well. One of the tastier bread baskets I've had!  Appetizers of Watermelon Panzanella and Calamari: The panzanella is a ""bread"" salad. Nice and big red and yellow watermelon cubes on top of mixed greens with olives  feta cheese and big cubes of toasted bread. Watermelon was tasty and paired nice with the salty cheese. The calamari was nice and crunchy  but came with this creamy aoli on top  would've liked something with more acidity to balance it out  Entrees of Chicken breast with black lentil hummus and grilled lamb chops. The chicken was a tad dry  but came on this bed of huge  thick cut  meaty  and sweet tomatoes  very nice. The black lentil hummus was yummy  nice lemony kick but warm and a bit thinner than usual hummus. The lamb chops were very tasty  with some type of bubbly glaze  I ate these up. The fatoush salad on the side was nice complement.  Dessert of seasonal sorbet trio and drunk chocolate trifle: The sorbets were a nice and I really liked the orange looking one  probably passionfruit. The bf didn't think there was enough chocolate in the trifle  there was only some chocolate ganache at the bottom. I thought it was just ok.  Lowdown: It's all about the view since it sits on outside of the Bellagio fountain lakes. Make an early reservation and sit on the patio. Weekend water shows start at noon  breathtaking! As far as the food  it had some good flavors  and with this price very reasonable  cheaper than brunch buffet. Normal priced though  wouldn't go  some problems with here and there with execution. There's probably many restaurants that are better at this price range  especially in LV. Do go for the view though!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best meals I have ever had. We have wanted to try Olives for a long time and just never had made it here before on trips to Las Vegas. The pasta was handmade and melted in your mouth. The entire meal was perfection.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a fabulous $20 restaurant week lunch today. One of the better restaurant week meals I've had!   Atmosphere: romantic  charming  upscale  whatever  check. Great views of the fountains.   Warm bread basket was particularly good. I hate olives but I was eating the olive tepanade UP. It was so yummy.   Course 1: Calarmi and BBQ pork tart. The tart was just OK  but the Calamari was awesome! Some of the best calamari I've ever had. I'll definitely be ordering that if I dine at Olives again.   Course 2: Lamb and Tuna nicoise salad. My salad was nice. It had cool touches - the egg was hard boiled AND smoked (very unique!)  and the tuna was decent. The lamb was better  however. Seasoned and prepared perfectly.   Course 3: Fruit Sorbet and chocolate trifle. The sorbets were excellent  but the trifle must have had crack in it. AMAZING. Dark chocolate pudding  Bailey's mousse  vanilla ice cream.. heavenly. The dark chocolate cookie they serve on the side was the only disappointment (crunchy.. and not so special).   Dessert took awhile (seems to be a trend lately!)  but overall service was great. I look forward to coming back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,its painful to say I wont be coming back to this place.  They have the best view & to top it off the best food BUT we had the world's worst server (especially for a fine dining)   Were servers so we understand what he was probably thinking   we werent one of those middle aged people dressed in suite so service probably wont matter.. but we were on a date expecting to get treated equally like the tables next to us && didnt get that at all.  our server was snobby. Unless youre middle aged  covered in diamonds and expensive watches and rings.. DONT COME HERE. Youre better off getting a to-go or eat somewhere else. I got treated better at olive garden than this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Dinner with a view! If you want to watch the Bellagio fountain show while having a delicious meal  this is the place to be. Their cheese and meat platter is what stood out for me. Mix this with their bread and you got something going here. Add a few drinks and you're just having a great time. This is an awesome place to take a date or show your touristy friends a little bit of Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here for a celebratory dinner while in Vegas. There are a lot of great tables  and a couple crappy ones. We fortunately got a good one  but I could see how someone could be upset if they got seated basically facing the mall  for what you're paying in food.   The food itself was very good. The Beef Carpaccio my dad got as an appetizer and boy was he surprised. It's basically a full meal in itself. If you aren't splitting it with at least another person  you're crazy. It's like saying I'm going to have the nachos platter as an appetizer. Look at the pictures; it's huge. That being said it's one of the most dynamic and interesting dishes we had that night  and sticks in my memory months later writing this review.   I had the scallops for dinner  which had some interesting sea beans which made for a deep  briny flavor. Not for everyone  but I enjoyed them.   So ya  if you can  ask for a table outside or at least away from the mall side. If you're looking for a cheaper meal  go with the flatbread. More reasonable (half price) compared to a full entree  you'll leave full  and the people around us seemed to be enjoying them.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my favorite places! I've been coming here for years and it's still amazing. We ordered filet mignon  scallops  bacon Mac and cheese and Brussels sprouts. Best scallops I've ever had. The meat was delicious as well  cooked perfectly. The staff was very attentive and friendly. Can't wait to come back and sit outside by the fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"definitely one of the better restaurants i have eaten at on the Strip.  eating out on the patio is a treat.  i have been here a few times for various events  and the food can be inconsistent  so i can definitely understand if other people have had more of the ""meh"" experience."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a 6:45 reservation but asked to be seated on the patio.  As we expected  there was an additional wait.  Seating time was 9:15 - wasn't expecting quite that long but okay  we waited and  for the view  it was worth it.  Unfortunately  after all that time we were given a table well away from the rail and didn't get the best view of the fountains.    We were happy that the view was special because the food was nothing more than average (expensive and average).  Because we had waited so long we had stopped for drinks and an appetizer earlier in the evening so we were not interested in a huge meal.  Good thing because the roasted chicken my husband ordered was a very small serving.  The sauce was delicious but that was the only stand out.  I ordered gnocchi.  Our meal was actually delayed because the kitchen felt that the first order was not right.  The order they served me was very unevenly heated.  I have a feeling I had some of the first order plus some additional new pasta.  The sauce was pretty heavy but the gnocchi were fine.  The menu mentions pulled chicken but there was very little of that on the plate.    There were several large groups on the patio that stayed for an extended time and were VERY loud - guess that's what you expect for late on a Saturday night.   Warning- a photographer will come around to take pictures  which we decided to purchase.  We paid in cash and she shorted us $5 on the change.  We didn't notice right away and were too tired to go back and ask about it.  They were overpriced to start with so......
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good experience here. Our waiter was very nice  and meal was delicious. My friend got the salmon and it was perfectly served  and my lobster pasta was great. Beautiful view of the Bellagio water display!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent service  great food. The Beef Carpaccio was excellent  my first time trying it. We were there during lunch on a busy weekend and our food came out fast.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was good  had to wait an extra 30 min to get outside table even though had a reservation. But the view was worth it. Had the scalops and the chilian seabass.  They were both a little over cooked for my taste.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I hardly write 1 starrrrers but I'm writing merely for the food on this one and not the terrace view.  Saturday night  last minute decision to head down stairs and go to olives.  Sat us right away - GREAT!   Server was nice - Great!   The quintessential Olives and awesome bread - Great!    Wine list  okay I understand mark up for most restaurants to be in the 4-5x range what you'd normally pay at your local wino store but how dare you Todd English try to gouge me 8x for a Mondavi Private Reserve 2008 for $163.  I don't care if I'm eating inside a fake replica of beautiful lake country in Northern Italy - absurd.     Food:  Squid and Octopus - half cold  half warm  thinking it was a mistake sent back and thrown up on the warmer and 5 minutes it was sent out to us.   Short Ribs - bland as H E double hockey sticks  another semi-warm dish that really lacked flavor.   Ribeye au Gratin - sucked  so much Gratin gotten  that the ribeye underneath was drowning.     Having been to the Charlestown location  I'm quite disturbed by how bad the Vegas version is.  I think I paid probably 40% more in Vegas for 80% worse food and 60% less wine.  WT F bomb Olives?  $200 bones for that?  Will never go back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love this place!!!!  They have pizzas under $20  pastas in the $20-$30 range  and nice meals $30+.  A friend came in from Cali for a convention so I took her here to eat. IF you get a little later reservation  like 8:15 8:30  and sit by the window or on the patios you have an amazing view of the Bellagio Fountains  they also go off more often after 8 or 830 like every 15 minutes.  Which is just awesome.  My guy friend got the Halibut [priced around $50] which was fantastic! In fact  it was better than mine. I got scallops on top of risotto cakes with beets and Brussels Sprouts [I would never have eaten this dish when I was little] anyhow it was good  but I would def order the Halibut next time :). I had meal envy.  My Cali friend ordered Salmon on top of risotto  I don't eat Salmon  but it looked good. She cleaned her plate than quickly mention she was def going to have to hit the gym when she got back home.  We shared a bottle of Russian River Cab too which was amazing!  She loved this place and said next time she came in town she was going back. Score 1 for me!  I was a little sad b/c they used to have this 'rabbit 2 ways dish' and they changed it. Keep in mind this place was the first and last time I've ever eaten rabbit and it was to die for. So they do update their menu.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My introduction to Todd English was with my first bite of the fig and proscuitto flatbread at the Olives in NY. I was hooked and have sought it out in every city where Todd has a restraurant (why Todd  why not in Chicago?).   I've eaten at this location of Olives twice now. Both times service was excellent and while it's not cheap  the food is worth the price. The butternut squash tortelli is excellent  and of course the fig and proscuitto flatbread is amazing. I wouldn't even think of coming here and not getting it.   If you don't want to eat a full meal here  come for a light lunch and enjoy some wine and flatbread on the patio overlooking the fountains  or sit at the bar where they have a special bar menu from 3-5pm.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I'm not a fan of ""hovering"" wait staff. When staff keeps an eye on the table to keep water glasses full  bread baskets replaced  bussed dishes between courses  a diner knows the staff is well trained and coached.  We had a party of nine recently and the service was almost perfect. Sometimes  a buss boy may be too eager to remove a plate that a diner continues to enjoy  but they politely recede and return after an appropriate interval.  I enjoyed watermelon salad  followed by tuna tartare. Both hit the spot. Other diners selected sea bass and other main courses. Delightful!  The view of the Bellagio fountains adds to a casually elegant atmosphere and even the children at other tables were well behaved. Strongly recommended."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was good as expected  but I must say that it has a feeling that this is an awesome place  but in my mind it's location  location.  You can have average food and snobby staff  but being in that location almost instills an artificial greatness that they think they have.  I made a reservation and indicated an outside table.  Upon arrival  the restaurant was 2/3 empty.  I was told it would be an hour wait for an outside table.  They seated me at a table by the door to the patio  this is super high traffic for the wait staff going in and out of the patio and making their way to the rest of the indoor dining area  most likely the worst table in the place.  Within 15 minutes of sitting down  walk up customers were able to be seated outside  very insulting.  There are too many other options to give a try for me.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wonderful! We stopped in for cocktails and late lunch. All was wonderful. And the view was the Bellagio Fountain Show. What was better; both! Must visit and enjoy.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Lunch or dinner  either way  one of my favorite places to dine on the strip.  I have never been dissatisfied here  and even if menu prices are noticeably more modest than at most new strip eateries  it isn't exactly inexpensive.  But my people... let me tell you:  if you eat supper here  order the Falling Cake for dessert and make room for it... or simply give in to gluttony.  You'll have to order it at the same time as your meal since the confectionary lovin' in the kitchen takes time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had high expectations for this restaurant but they were not met. The beef carpaccio was wonderful and the highlight of the meal. The butternut squash tortelli was overly sweet. The service was not horrible but it also wasn't what I would expect in a high-end restaurant.  If you go (and there are plenty of better dinner choices)  be prepared to have to refill your own wine glass.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,beautiful place  intimate tables  and a decent view of the bellagio fountains. reservations are a must and even though we were late  they kindly seated us at the next available table.  the menu was pretty standard of items so i settled on the salmon mainly for the israeli couscous. the fish was prepared well with a side of steamed veggies and the couscous was rich  but not overpowering. overall  the meal was very uneventful though i did feel healthy and ready for a night out.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I can't give it one star b/c the food is good.  Monday night-June in Vegas.  My Moms 70th...every time I am in Vegas I eat here-always good.  My moms 1st trip in 30 years-seemed like the logical spot.  No requests for patio ahead of time-well when we arrived 30 minutes ahead of time for our reservation we were told the patio already had a 1hr  wait???? When I asked how that was possible I was told it just was. We got a nice booth.  Happy.  Asked for a Sommelier and it took 30 minutes though Adam was awesome once he got there. Waiter-Reimer S  was the weak link. Rude  rushed and 1st time ever I had a bill removed from my hand when I finished signing it -literally. I would have to say a longtime classic has succumbed to the tourist trappings and it is too expensive to be treated like cattle ...sad. And super bummed we chose to spend this special night here.#nodoovers
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing restaurant at the Bellagio!!!! Food was second to none.  Definitely worth the money!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great bread and tepenade. This update is for olives to potentially read this and know your servers are rude. Period. I've been coming her regularly for say 5 years now. I can count on one hand how many servers weren't rude. It's like where am I ? East coast or something. They rush you here. Their explanation of the menu is curt at best. The overall environment is rushed and rude. The food is great. Drinks great. Hostess girls and runners are great. Waiters need to go burn out somewhere else. I can't overlook this. We come here 6 times a year or more.  No more.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The first time I went to Olives was New Year's week with my boyfriend. We sat in the main dining area. The ambiance was cozy  romantic  and full of energy. The service was prompt and courteous. And most importantly  the food was amazing!  I love the breads and olive tapenades that come before the meal! I'm especially fond of the chocolate bread....it has a slight sweetness while still retaining a traditional ""bread and butter"" taste.  The highlights:  The beef carpaccio was delicious and fresh  paired nicely with an arugula salad  parmesan shavings  polenta cake  and balsamic reduction.  Chilean Sea Bass with wild mushroom risotto and sauteed spinach was cooked perfectly!  And their desserts were to die for! I usually find that if a restaurant does their savory foods extremely well  their desserts end up lacking. I almost always order dessert when I'm dining out. And I can say that I am IN LOVE with Olive's hazelnut souffle! Baked perfectly with dramatic height it is paired with the most delicious type of creme anglaise.    The overall dining experience was so perfect that we made reservations for dinner the next night  but the second time we sat outside with the view of the Bellagio fountain. It was a bit chilly even with the heat lamps  but the food was on point again and the view of the water shows was well worth it! I will definitely be coming back to Olives."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,CARPACCIO!!!! GET IT!!!! You won't regret this one!  While other people are busy shopping for Xmas gifts  I'm always busy thinking and dreaming of what my Xmas meal will be. For 2010  I went to Olives for my Xmas dinner and was amazed at the wonderful service and delicious food.   We ordered off of their Xmas menu so some of the items featured are not a part of the regular menu...sadness *tears* I was thankful I came here to celebrate my Xmas nonetheless.  For starters I had the carpaccio and the chestnut soup. The Carpaccio is freaking amazing and its HUGE! The whole plate alone could have been my entree and I would have left a happy happy girl. Amazing  fresh  and clean flavors  it was soooo good  I still drool dreaming of it. The polenta cake on the bottom though was a miss and I would have been happy without it. The chestnut soup was creamy and delicious  not too strong or heavy.   I split the Lobster pappardelle and duck two ways. The pappardelle was very generous in lobster portions. It had a full lobster tail plus more lobster chunks cooked with the pappardelle. The duck two ways wasn't bad  but I've come to realize that I'm just far too picky about duck that its hard to please me.  I didn't like the dessert selection  but I went with the cookie plate because it seemed the safest of all the choices for me. It was actually a surprisingly delicious treat. Cookies were warm  crispy on the outside  and soft on the inside. Peanut butter cookie was the bomb and the cookies were still delicious the day after!  Would definitely come here again. The service is great and the food is amazing  I would love to just try out some of the other selections in the future! Todd English lives up to the hype!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is fantastic! Delicious food with a romantic outdoor patio perfect for watching the famous fountain shows. That said  you can't go wrong with a table inside either  as the decor is dialed.   If you DO have the option to sit outside  definitely do it. We opted to wait an extra half hour and it was more than worth it. The view of the Bellagio fountains is incredible!! Beautiful and romantic  nice and quiet.   Michelle was our server and she was absolutely fantastic! What a personality. So funny and personable. Somehow  she knew exactly what we'd enjoy - she was like our dinnertime Yoda. Michelle even split my entree into two different pasta dishes because I was indecisive and she wanted me to experience both.   I had the ricotta ravioli and the butternut squash stuffed pasta - they were great. My boyfriend had the crazy mushroom pasta with peas and enjoyed that very much as well. Charcuterie was awesome.  And for dessert  we split the chocolate lava cake. You obviously can't go wrong with that. Ever.   Thank you Olives and Michelle for making my boyfriend's birthday so special. :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We had high hopes for Olives  a very popular spot in Vegas  and were disappointed. Food was good  not amazing  but the service was not up to standard. We made a 745 reservation and arrived on time  the hostess told us we could wait just a few minutes to get a seat by a window to see the Bellagio fountain. At least 20 people were seated ahead of us  as we stood right in front of the hostess stand where she instructed. We rechecked in  and she said the system made a ""glitch"" and deleted us. We were finally seated at 8:20  not by a window. No apologies  no comps  and after that everything was good but not great."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"AAAHHHHH!! How to write this review...  I'd give the restaurant two and a half stars - It's just alright  but too expensive for ""just alright."" I'd never eat dinner there again  but I (might!) go for lunch every other time or so (emphasis on the ""so"") when I visit Vegas.   I do  though  go to Olives EVERY TIME I VISIT VEGAS  mind you...  Why five stars? Because the BAR IS FIVE+ STARS!!!  The rockstar bartenders there  most noteables are Joey V. and Zak C.  actually care to make a good  well-balanced  strong cocktail.   They friggin' use a jigger and don't put on a show (Fuck the Flairtenders in Vegas!). Your show begins when you start drinking the perfection in your glass.   Never disappointed  sometimes completely suprised  always satisfied. They've got it in the bag  every single time I've been there  which is about a dozen times in the last three years. That kind of consistency is hard to keep up year after year.  Damn  thinking about their cocktails makes me want to go find a flight out..."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,every little thing in this restaurant was pure perfction. even the little pats of butter and olive spread for the perfectly baked bread was oh so tasty.    all the plates were beatifully served.. the staff was courteous and professional. ambiance was wonderfully romantic....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Vegas is full of 5 star restaurants and this has become one of our favorites. We've been here twice. One for a lunch date with friends and another time to celebrate a friends birthday.    For lunch you can usually just walk in without needing a reservation. If you come here for dinner or on the weekend be sure you make a reservation. Get here early so you can get patio seating and enjoy the Belagio fountain show while you enjoy their fresh Italian cuisine.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives was our last stop before leaving Vegas and it was a great way to end the trip. We asked to sit outside and were warned that there were only tables left that weren't in the shade. We decided to go for it but almost instantly regretted it. Our sever quickly moved us upon seeing our distress  which was greatly appreciated.   Great food and service and one of the best views of the Bellagio fountains. Highly recommend.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Is there an option for 10stars  Amazing amazing service I have been here before and I just had to come back! I made a reservation 2 weeks prior to my arrival because they are always usually packed. The hostess from the start was so very kind and she told me it'll be an extra 30 minutes to be seated outside  but assured me they will do there best to get a table ready soon. Knowing I would have to wait a little longer to be seated outside i was totally fine with waiting.  Came back 30 minutes later to be seated almost right away; but while walking up the hostess remembered my name! It's just the small efforts that count to make a customer feel appreciated and welcomed.  We got seated right away was handed the iPad with the drinks and dessert menu and the dinner menu. Our server was AMAZINGLY he new what to suggest us and everything he suggested was so amazingly delicious we ordered the Fig Prosciutto which was so amazing!  For our dinner entrees we ordered the mushroom pasta and the sea scallops which are my favorite! It was my bfs birthday and they. Brought out a cute little dessert for him. For an extra dessert for our sweet tooth we ordered the banana tiramisu which I think by far was the best dessert I have ever tasted! Everything was a plus and every one of the employees started with the hostess  and our waiter it was amazing to be served by the best people.  Nothing but good things to tell! Definitely recommend this place!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Lunch was pretty good but not awesome.  The beef carpaccio was the best thing we had.  Crab stuffed shrimp was nice but the po' boy was just so-so.  Our real complaint was the $50 corkage fee.  Ridiculous!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here recently looking for a nice meal on my Vegas trip and Olives certainly delivered. The atmosphere of the restaurant is very classy and upscale. The 3 different breads and dips they bring out to the tables were very good. It was a hot day and I was thirsty and my water glass was always topped off. I ordered the Lobster Fettuccine which I don't see on the yelp version of their dinner menu (Perhaps it needs updating...). It tasted very good and had what I thought to be unique flavors. The dish was the perfect size for a meal for me  not to big nor too small.   The reason I could not give 5 stars and had to settle with 4 stars is because I felt like we were slightly rushed. Maybe because it wasn't perhaps as big of a check as maybe there was hope for. Either that or I assume that I'm not the only one to feel this way. I enjoyed the food here very much  but I save my 5star reviews for places where I can literally not find a single thing wrong with the meal.   Would I recommend Olives to someone in Vegas? Yes if I thought they were the type of people to appreciate it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I always look forward to come to Olives when I come to Vegas. It is somewhere you definitely need to make reservations or else you prob gonna have to wait. I never tried it for dinner but lunch is good and inexpensive.   Service is usually good. They usually have lunch specials and I usually get that but i guess it depends on what pasta lunch special they have. Their pastas are really good because it's hand toss/house made. I also really recommend sharing a beef capraccio with a friend which is SUPER GOOD. There are like stuffing inside the middle of the plate and kind of a salad. I don't really like the stuffing but besides that It is super good.   I recommend anybody coming here for lunch(never tried dinner) when they're in vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Not my favorite...but not bad...I made a reservation for after our 7:30 performance of O  and when we got there it was very crowded and they sat us pretty quickly. Our waiter definitely took some time to warm up to us...we got a vibe that he felt like because we only ordered one glass of wine each (not a bottle) and entrees (not appetizers AND entrees) that we were a little less important than the people ""indulging."" He ended up being very nice by the end of the meal and even snuck us out the doors onto the balcony to catch the end of the Bellagio Fountain Water show.   Now let's talk food- I consider myself a foodie while my mother is not so much. Because I didn't feel like spending 50 dollars on an entree I settled for the 36 dollar chicken. My mother had the Tortelli pasta. While my chicken was good  it definitely wasn't as hot as it should have been  the plate however was scorching which led me to believe my dish must have sat under a heating lamp while they finished cooking my mothers pasta. The flavors were good but the temperature left something to be desired.   This place is good...but our experience did not blow us away. If you get a table out on the balcony it's probably worth the whole trip  but this place just didn't ""rock us"" and for those prices...it should."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great meal loved the oysters the corn ravioli was spectacular and the trout and polenta was top-notch and the sorbet was a nice finish to the meal.The wait staff was amazing-special shout out to Nelson for making making it such a great night.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went for an early dinner before a show - too windy to sit outside so enjoyed a window seat inside. The atmosphere was nice and our server was friendly. I ordered the halibut special; my husband ordered the pesto gnocchi. The lobster risotto that came with my halibut was actually better then the fish as the fish was slightly over cooked. I tried my husband's dish - it was pretty bland. Another disappointing meal at one of the overpriced restaurants in the Bellagio.  I really don't expect reasonable prices but I do expect some stellar food for the prices these places do charge.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a reservation for a 1:30 p.m. lunch and requested to be seated on the patio.    They started us off with a variety of breads we tried the octopus and squid appetizer (huge portion)...so delicious  octopus was cooked perfected  ever bite was tender.  It  was served with a chickpeas in the sauce which was so delicious.   we also tried the flat bread with clams. the flat bread was cooked perfectly but I think it needed a little salt. My lunch companion loved it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love the casual and friendly atmosphere here. The portions are huge and the food is hearty. The waiter convinced us to try the beef carpaccio and it was ...interesting but delicious. Also  the grilled squid and octopus in chickpeas was really good. I had a burger that wasn't very memorable but I did leave satisfied. While we were there  the Bellagio water show started and we totally wished we were sitting by the window  so try to get a table facing the fountain!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This place gets 5 stars alone for having my favorite Jamaican rum which I discovered on my honeymoon and can never find at restaurants or bars except the bar at my house.    Just to echo everyone below  great bread  great toppings for the bread (I wonder why he calls the place Olives.....) and nice view of the fountains.    I started with a sausage flatbread/pizza that I shared with others at the table.  For the main course I went with a veal chop which was great.  We had to rush though because we were going to see ""O"" right after dinner.  (By the way  O was a BIG letdown.  I've seen several other Cirque shows  was most looking forward to this and totally disappointed.)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,In true Vegas style  the birthday girl found a high stakes poker champ to be our patron for the weekend. He made us (5girls) reservations at Todd's at 12:30 on the patio  just in time to see the watershow....how thoughtful! It was fabulous! We were by far the youngest people having lunch  but that didn't stop us form being overly obnoxious with the picture taking  loud giggling and inappropriate comments.  We started with the beef carpaccio  which was out of this world! The oysters were just eh...too big for my taste. I had the butternut squash pasta  which was delicious  but way too much food for my still drunk state. We also tried the scallops  which had huge potential  but tasted fishy...so I'd say a miss. The halibut was also fishy...another miss. Overall  I'd say Olive's is very hit or miss....I can't rave enough about the carpaccio  and the butternut squash was nothing to scoff at....however  everything else was lackluster...and dare I say too fishy smelling/tasting.  With all the fine restaurants in Vegas  I don't think I'll be back to Olive's...for the price  nothing should have smelled or tasted fishy....that's just amateur! However  since it was all free  and we did have a good time  I'm going with 3 stars
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is an ok middle of the road restaurant. Is was not as classy or as great of food as we had hoped. Restaurant is smallish and hot when crowded. Our party had flatbread  which was good. Chicken which was moist and smelled great  and ravioli was very good. We had expected more of an Italian restaurant. Service was ok but not quick. A nice place to dine.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My fiance and I had a phenomenal time at Olives. Located at the Bellagio. Kind of a hike to get to but a beautiful walk through of Bellagio and its finest shops  gaming & restaurants. We requested a seat on the patio right next to the balcony - best seats in the house. You're right up and close to the famous Bellagio fountains. The fountains go off about every 20 min. We saw as the fountains were timed to beautiful classic  opera and Italian music. It was such a nice getaway from all the club music bumping around Vegas - although fun in its own vibe. We sat through 5 shows of the fountains until the first song played again - completely breathtaking each time with a gorgeous view of all the hotels & shops situated around the beautiful lake. I haven't even started talking about the food yet. We ordered the 2 vegetarian options on the menu - ricotta ravioli without the sausage and the butternut tortelli. Both to die for. The ravioli had delicious marinara and sweet onions over it. I savored every bite. We also got the Domain Chandon Etoile Rose because why not get a little bubbly ;). The waiter was very professional and attentive. I love when people say ""you're welcome."" I feel it's a sign of excellence to be acknowledged like that. This place knows how to do dinner right without trying too hard. Nothing beats the view  service and excellent food. It's the best restaurant I've eaten at in Vegas so far."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wonderful food and great service. Go for lunch to save a bit of money and a more casual feeling. Love sitting on the patio and watching the fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Absolutely fabulous food from starters to finish.  For a veggie girl and a carnivorous boy...this restaurant had it all.  In fact  he was picking off of my plate.  The tapenade was divine and could be a meal in itself.  We started with the eggplant flatbread and had to stop ourselves for fear of spoiling our appetite.  I had the butternut squash ravioli which is raved about on Yelp and for good reason...so velvety and rich.  Olives is Vegas without feeling pretentious.  We'll definitely be back again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went to this place with my husband and parents  who were visiting from out of town. The best part about the experience was sitting outside on the patio and watching the Bellagio fountains. We had a late reservation so it wasn't too hot. The fountains and ambiance were great. The food was so-so. We are definitely pasta people so 3 of us had a pasta dish and my husband had the scallops. I had the gnocchi with chicken...it was ok. I guess I'm a purist because this gnocchi was served with chicken and red sauce which was slightly non-traditional. It had a good flavor and the gnocchi was delicious (definitely fresh) but the chicken was on the dry side - overall didn't think the dish was worth the price. My dad had the ravioli which was pretty standard and again overpriced. My husband had the scallops  they were cooked perfectly  but he was slightly disappointed that there were only 3 for the price. Probably pretty standard on the strip though. Service was not that great either. The waiter only spent about 5 min total at our table  he wasn't that helpful in making recommendations  took a while to get some drinks  including standard iced tea. He also didn't write down our orders - which is fine - but then came back to the table 2 separate times to confirm the orders. That was a little annoying - if you can't remember  just write it down. Overall  will probably not rush back here. Best part about the whole experience was the fountains and outdoor seating. Can probably find better amongst all the other places on the strip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is an amazing restaurant! The restaurant is so sexy and the food is out of this world. Came here with my family after we had been hiking at Red Rock all day  so we were definitely ready to eat some seriously good food. And I'm glad I was hungry when we arrived there so that I could finish my food. I ordered a cosmo for my cocktail; it was the best cosmo I've ever had. I know it's not a complicated drink  but some how hey managed to take it to the next level.  We ordered the portobello flatbread...so delicious with fontina and truffle oil. Yummmm. I ordered the seabass for my entree...amazing. That's all i can come up with to describe it. Melted in my mouth.  We had great service  and everything we ordered was outstanding. This is a place you take someone you are really trying to impress. It's definitely really pricey though (it's vegas after all) so be ready to drop some dough here.  I have yet to find a restaurant on the strip that tops Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Five stars. Wow. I am being sweet today. But why not?  We got a reservation an hour after we called. We were seated immediately. The waiter was fantastic. The bussers were on top of their game. Never an empty glass of water or a dirty dish on the table. The prices were what was expected of an establishment such as this one. And of course  the food was delectable.  I probably don't need to say anything more  but I will. i haven't yet learned to shut my mouth.  Our waiter was very personable  as well as professional. One of my three companions had been there two years prior  and had eaten a dish he no longer saw on the menu. He asked about it. The waiter informed him that the dish had been taken off the menu  but recalled in detail how the dish was served.  In twenty minutes  we had that dish on our table  specially prepared by the cook on the fly  and served to us as an appetizer. In another restaurant? Maybe. But it happened here.  i ordered the ribeye. I could have used my fork to cut into this piece of meat. Okay  I'm exaggerating. But it was very tender. Cooked a perfect medium rare. And sitting on a bed of smushed up grass. Ha. I'm sure there's a technical term for it  but well  I didn't know what it was and that's what it looked like to me. So that's what I'm calling it. And if you don't like it  tough shit. I'm not a professional diner. I'm just a girl who loves her steak  and sitting on smushed up grass was a very good piece of steak. And hey  the grass tasted good!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had our wedding reception dinner here and it was AMAZING!! I worked with Nicole on the reservation perfecting things for months and she was soo accommodating! Several times I asked to have the menu options changed and she was able to check with the chef and make that accommodation for us! She also helped me organize our cake and it came out perfectly! All of our 40 guests were in awe at how good our meal was and multiple people said it was the best meal they had while out in Vegas! We offered our guests tuna or beef tartare  Caesar salads or hummus as a vegan option. Hummus portions were huge! Tuna and beef tartare got a ton of good reviews from friends and family! We also offered salmon  beef tenderloin  veggie risotto  or a chicken dish. Our friends complimented each of these dishes! Overall this was a wonderful experience for all of us! The food was delicious  the managers were super accommodating and helpful! The restaurant is beautiful inside and outside is the beautiful fountain show! We love it here and will definitely be back to visit again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food. Decent service. I had a daily special flatbread. Would eat again. Had great view of dancing fountain.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My husband and I had lunch here and really enjoyed it!  He is vegetarian  and got the butternut squash tortelli  which was really good and unique from the usual vegetarian offerings. I had the meatloaf  which was your basic meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The service was excellent and we would definitely come back again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good.  Try the lamp chops and beef carpaccio.  A great outside patio and a nice high end bar.   In the Bellagio hotel.   A must try
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had only two nights for dinner in Vegas and one of the nights we chose Olives based on other Yelp reviews.  We were not impressed.  We had high hopes for Olives  and the dinner menu looked so promising.  Alas  it was not to be. We started with the Beef Carpaccio  which was one of the waiter's recommendations. It was underseasoned and just underwhelming  there was a decent piece of crispy polenta hiding under a mass of salad greens  the beef was all over the plate hiding under a mass of sauces. The Caesar Salad was a 'deconstructed' salad  basically a wedge type salad - not what we were wanting or expecting.  For the main entrees  we got the Mushroom Fettuccine and the Sea Scallops.  The scallops were not seared very well  no flavor and the pasta was again  under seasoned and just not very good.  I expected more mushrooms since that was the title  but is was swimming in a cream sauces with little mushrooms  and there was red pepper in there that I thought tasted really distracting. Underwhelming is the best word to describe everything.    Plus  the decor was really dark.  Yes  I know it's mood lighting but it was too dark for that kind of a restaurant.  Could hardly see the menu or the food!  I felt like it was the type of restaurant where they're herding people in  then herding people out.    For the prices they were charging  we were left very disappointed.  We expected a quality meal but instead received mediocre food - way too much going on with the plating.  Too much garnish  saucing  just too much stuff on the plate  didn't allow the main ingredients to shine.  And the main ingredients were prepared in a sloppy  unrefined manner.  I actually prefer Cheesecake Factory over Olives  and I would rate the type of food as on the same level.  Except Olives charges 3x as much.   If you want a truly memorable meal and are willing to shell out the bucks  skip Olives and go to Tom Colicchio's Craft Steak.  Amazing service  fabulous food  quality throughout. That was definitely a meal to remember.  Olives  meh  not so much.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So while in Vegas for 3 nights  I booked 2 restaurants and winged it for the third.  This was the restaurant I winged and I sure am glad I picked this place!  I love that this was in the Bellagio and while I was enjoying my meal  I could watch the SPECTACTULAR fountains every 15 minutes!  I was immediately struck by the dark mood in the place and my favorite part was the beginning-foccacia bread with the olive spreads! So unbelievably delicious! I didn't even miss the butter!  For appetizers  we enjoyed a proscuitto flatbread which was also out of this world.  All the carbs did wonders for my aching stomach (alcohol-related).  For main I had the angolitti which was delicious but cold.  That was my only issue.  My husband had the shrimp and dumplings-amazing!  The shrimp was explosively good and the dumplings melted in your mouth.  I was too full for dessert but awesome place...glad I winded up here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When you're in Vegas on the strip and are craving a nice Italian dinner  I highly recommend Todd English's Olive at the Bellagio. Excellent pasta   great customer service  and a prime view of the famous Bellagio water show.  Enjoyed with my family were the following:  - Onion Foccacia (complimentary in your bread basket): perfect tenderness and flavor pact.  - Gnocchi ($32): Did I mention best ever? No? Because I'm not kidding. I've had some good gnocchi in San Francisco and even Florence  Italy - but this plate in particular hit all the right notes in regards to texture and flavor composition. Delicate pillow-y soft gnocchi layered in a beautiful light tomato coulis with pulled chicken  goat cheese  kalamata olives  and toasted pistachios...this is the kind of dish that I'd love to enjoy again and again and again.  - Fettucini Carbonara ($37): ordered this dish bc I've adored a similarly constructed dish at Haven in Oakland. Crab  pancetta  and egg yolks emulsfied in a cream sauce - all the good guilty things in life - how can you go wrong? As a result  the dish was indeed flavorful and the pasta tenderly al-dente  but just a bit too salty for my palate. Overall  very enjoyable  but Chef Kim Alter's version (Smoked Pasta) still remains my #1.  - Prosciutto & Fig Flatbread ($19). Good  but slightly dissapointed. Prosciutto and figs are such a natural flavor combo that you wonder how on earth can you screw this one up? For some sad reason the figs were so overcooked they tasted like prunes. Or  did someone make a horrible decision to use dried figs...and not fresh figs? Regardless  this was the only dish which we had leftovers of.  - Pomegranite Souffle ($14): Though light and custardy as any good souffle and presented elegantly  the pomegranite flavor is no where to be found. It might've been covered up by the creme anglaise and pistachio ice cream.  All in all  though the prices are a bit on the heftier side for the cuisine  you pay for the view - and the delicious pastas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The wife and I stopped by here even before going to our room. When you have kids and want to go on vacation without them there is much to prepare for  after two days of planning and preparing our children and their babysitter we were exhausted by the time our plane landed and we arrived at the Bellagio  therefore  we were starving!  We got there between lunch and dinner therefore the bar area was the only open area. I desperately needed some fermented malts and barley  so much so I was willing to pay for it as opposed to drinking for free on the floor or in the poker room. The only downside is they do not have any beers on tap  just in the bottle; however  they had a good selection. My wife's diet coke was $5 dollars?! Not sure if it was blessed with baby tears or had gold flakes in it  but diet coke should never be $5 dollars..  Anyways  the wife ordered their burger with the works  and I ordered the beef Carpaccio. Let me start off with my wife's burger  it was only about a 3 star burger  the accompaniments were pretty standard for a place like this  to include over-ratted truffle oil  do not get me wrong  I like truffles  but having had many truffle oils and owning some myself I find it hard to pay the extra for something I do not feel to be as pure or as good as what some places try to portray it as. Her burger was decent  only slightly over cooked but came in at over $20. The fries that come with it are probably made by 3 potatoes; they were sliced like jo-jos so they were even huger in appearance.  My beef Carpaccio was by far the best I have ever had. This is an explosion of flavor and compliments. The beef tasted so fresh  crisp  and clean.  Underneath had a deep fried Gorgonzola polenta square  on top was parmesan  cipolin onions  balsamic reduction  scallion cream  garlic aioli the nice thing about the deep fried square was the subtle heat it radiated throughout the dish. The toppings were perfect and wonderfully complimented each other.  For my wife's meal and my meal  which was technically an appetizer it cost us over $60 bucks that included 1 beer 1 diet coke and tip. But  it was still worth it  I will forever remember my beef Carpaccio  it is easily one of the best dishes I have had!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Been here 2x  both for lunch.   The green focaccia bread in the bread basket is the best.  I only like green olives if I'm eating at Olives. =D Tuna Carpaccio and  Beef Carpaccio are both delish  order those if they sound even the least bit appealing.   If you like scallops and risotto...the Pan Seared Scallops are worth ordering. The new england style lobster roll is actually a sub...my cousin was like UUHHH  but it was still good because it was loaded with chunks of lobster and was flavorful.   Service is above average  and I'd come back again. It's not too pricey for its dining atmosphere and the fact that it's in Bellagio-welll of course for the food as well.   Definitely drop by if you're looking for a lunch spot and is staying or visiting Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had made reservations at Olives for my friend's birthday because she's never seen the water show at Bellagio  and what a better way to see it than from your dining table on the patio overlooking the entire lake? I had booked reservations for 5pm but we were running late  and I called the restaurant to let them know and they were totally ok with it. When we got there I requested patio seating and it wasn't a problem at all  which was great because I was worried that we wouldn't get one based on reviews. You can't reserve specifically where you sit via phone/web  you have to ask when you get there. Thank goodness for us they had one available!  Because it is summer and weather in vegas is ridiculously hot  they had mist things on outside  so you get a little damp from the water. but i think that's ok cuz i'd rather be a little damp and cool than sweating my ass off.  When we were seated the waiter immediately came over to take drink requests and with our menus. He was super friendly and courteous  which I appreciated very much. He was quick to bring us our drinks and the bread with olive tapenades  which were AMAZING. He was helpful with deciphering some of the items on the menu as well  and when we ordered  was quick to bring out our food. Just so efficient! And when our food came out the water show was going on so we didn't touch our food yet  and he came over concerned that there may be something wrong with our food that we weren't happy about and wanted to know if there was anything he could do! He was truly the best.  So  my friend and I shared the Tempura-Fried Soft Shelled Crab  the Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread  and Parmesan fries. All were delicious. I'm not a big fan of crustaceans  but the Crab was amazing! The flatbread was a little too salty for my taste  but still delicious nonetheless. The fries were good as well. My other friend ordered the Ricotta Ravioli  which seemed good as well.  Because I had informed them that the dinner was for a friend's birthday  they came out with a trio of truffles for her at the end of our meal  with ""happy birthday"" written in dark chocolate on top. So beautiful! the three truffles were placed on top of caramel sauce  and i think they were key lime  peanut butter and jelly  and dark chocolate. We each sampled one and they were SO GOOD.   Overall  an excellent experience. The staff was great  food was great  ambiance was fabulous. I can't wait to go again =)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really enjoyed olives.  We started with the tuna tartar was was delicious although a tad bit on the oily side.  They also brought out bread before the meal with a selection of olives and olive spreads.  All three are delicious.  I had the seafood risotto and my wife had the ravioli.  The risotto was good but the shrimp were very fishy and a little bit of a turnoff.  My wife's ravioli were great and she was very happy with her selection.  For dessert we had the banana fosters which was absolutely amazing and comes highly recommended.  We had a few different alcoholic drinks during the meal  all which were unique but delicious.  Again  I really enjoyed olives.  Give it a try.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow wow wow. I mean this place was amazing. We had drinks at the bar while waiting for our table and the bartenders were on point. Everything they gave was were exceptionally well done. We had dinner outside on the terrace and it was wonderful with watching the bellagio waterfront show every 15 min. I mean it was like having dinner with a show. It was such an amazing experience I will never forget this night. I had the scallops with the mushroom risotto and could not have been happier. Also- I had the best crime brulee of my life here. It was so good I'm salivating just thinking about it. I can not urge people more to come here. Yes the price is a little steep  but considering the location  ambience  and the quality of food I think it's definitely worth it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great steak. Ask to sit on the patio so you can watch the fountains during dinner. Michelle was awesome  we will ask for her on our next visit
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for dinner.  Boy was it expensive  but Ive never tasted food like this!  My husband and me weren't that hungry  so we ordered The Chilean Sea Bass. It was really delicious! I have never eaten fish like that. The sauce was amazing! portion was okay. But my husband and I don't eat alot so it was fine  We had our 1year old with us so I just asked them for some butter with pasta and they gave us an appetizer price for it. He absolutely loved it!   ONLY reason this gets 4 stars is that it was way too busy - our server we had to catch him and it was hard to get hold of anyone if we needed something or to order. I didn't like that. Because in a fancy place you expect excellent service!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,They Have a very good wine selection. Dos was really good. Recommend the blue cheese salad and the crazy mushroom parpadelle. It is a little bit overpriced  but again you are in Vegas and with great vie of the Bellagio fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Let me make it short and quick! WONDERFUL  WONDERFUL  WONDERFUL.....Great food  good portions  great drinks  amazing service  beautiful & classy decor  fantastic location right on the water... all around magnificent experience & can't wait to return. I would definitely recommend Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The steak was AMAZING and of course if you can get a seat outside on the balcony there is no better view in Vegas. The wine list is a bit over-priced and the service wasn't the best as they forgot us in the bar while waiting for a table for over an hour (it was a 20 minute wait). Overall though a great place and fabulous food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Outstanding Mediterranean inspired cuisine in a comfortable  contemporary setting.  For starters  the carpaccio  is delicious.  It's different.  It's not about the beef but rather all the ingredients creating a more substantial dish.  The garlic aioli  balsamic reduction and Parmesan cheese go so well together and their combined earthiness accentuates the sweet  raw beef flavor.  The Kobe beef tartare is also excellent though not traditional.    Flat breads are all excellent.  The thin  crispy  and slightly blackened bread is the perfect foil to any topping.  The fig and prosciutto; wow!  Mushroom lovers should not pass up the Portobello flat bread.  Really well cooked without all the liquid that usually makes any mushroom flat bread soggy.  Pastas  especially stuffed pastas  are excellent.  The goat cheese ""dumplings"" pair perfectly with a tomato ragu and pesto.  The butternut squash tortelli  the perfect dish for the fall  is absolutely delicious in its simple brown butter sauce with texture from crushed amaretto cookies.  For all my visits  I have never made it to any of the mains.  It is just to hard to skip the starters  flat breads  and pastas.  Service is excellent.  The wines by the glass selection is limited but very well chosen.  The overall wine selection is very good with many reasonably priced  simple wines that match the cuisine well.  Recommended."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was not a fan of the beef carpaccio that most reviews raved about  but the grilled octopus and squid was a great dish.  However  the MUST try dish was the Manila Clams with pasta.  Wow  the fresh pasta made this dish.  I'm still dreaming of this dish as I'm writing this review.  They also have a great selection of wines  which was a big plus.  The service was just meh.  Could be better and more attentive for an upscale restaurant.  Overall it was a nice experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place has an amazing patio. Drinks are great.  As for the food. I'm  bit torn. As its only good  maybe even mediocre. I had a meatball flat bread and the meat seemed to be stale and funky tasting. I sent it back and the duck gnocchi was better but also. Just OK. I did not have the heart to send this back. My mistake as I was charged for the more extensive of the two dishes.. ($3 difference) but seems that it was my fault I had to wait for a second dish and ordered a pricier plate.  So... Worth the view if you get the patio.. Not the Best food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love it. I made reservations for my wedding anniversary and birthday. The service was excellent. The lollipop pork chops were delicious but the ratatouille and couscous was bland. The pumpkin souffle was delish. I got a window view of the fountains. To get a patio view in order to listen to the music during the fountain show you have to get there 90 minutes before your reservation. I did not have such time so I settled for the window view. The waiter was lovely and kind enough to surprise us with a happy anniversary and birthday desserts.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  service  and ambiance. Everything we ordered was so  so good - from the fennel salad  the chicken flatbread  to the eggplant pizza and butternut squash pasta dish. The bellinis were yummy and so were the cookies. Like I said  everything was so good!  Try to get a table outside next to the fountain if you can.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The other night Paul Anthony gave us the most incredible dining experience. Best server I have ever had at any restaurant hands down! The food was phenomenal  the ambiance was breathtaking  and I would highly recommend olives for anyone traveling to Vegas. The whole night was magical and worth every penny!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Made reservations about a month ago to ensure a 7 o'clock window table for four on 6/27. Arrived at 6:45 and was seated at 7:00.... in the middle of the restaurant. Asked about our window table and was told ""you should have told the lady at the desk when you checked in"". I did over the phone a month ago! Fumed over this the whole dinner. Why call in advance then?? This took away the one star. Our waiter Chris was very helpful and attentive. All the dishes were excellent  especially the Beef Tenderloin and Char Grilled Lamb Chops. Yummy! Our friend was able to cross off a couple of his culinary bucket list items by ordering the Beef Tartare and Sea Urchin dish. A little out of my comfort zone  but he said both were amazing. My wife ordered the Butternut Squash Tortelli and found it to be like a Thanksgiving dish with the sage in it. She asked if it could be returned and they promptly replaced it with her second choice  Ricotta Ravioli. Loved it. All in all  would I return??? Yes  but I left with a bad taste in my mouth by not being able to get the window table I had reserved a month in advance."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The boyfriend and I had a wonderful date-night here! Olives is a beautiful restaurant overlooking the famous Bellagio fountains that manages to be elegant  without being snobby. We were seated right away and blessed with a warm & friendly  attentive server that handled everything perfectly from start to finish. It's been over a week and I'm still dreaming about the food & cocktails!   A Few Tips:  1)  Make reservations. They won't guarantee a spot on the patio  but they'll ensure you're seated quickly. If it's freakin' hot outside (often the case in Vegas)  don't be a dumbass & ask to sit outside...you'll most likely be uncomfortable & sweaty.  2) Dress up a little. I wouldn't call it overly ""fancy""  but you will most likely feel out of place in jeans  so leave the fanny-pack at home.  3) Order a Signature Cocktail from the menu. They're a little spendy...but oh-so-delicious and refreshing! My ""Two-Pear"" martini was worth every penny.  4) Listen to your fellow Yelpers and order the recommended dishes. Your tastebuds will thank you! We ordered the fig/prosciutto flatbread and it was sweet + savory & crispy...delicious! Our entree  Butternut Squash Tortelli...was a medley of amazing flavors and each bite literally melted in my mouth. I ate slowly because I didn't want it to end...ever. Simply devine!  5) Their portions are decent  so come hungry. Plus  dinner comes with a huge basket of assorted breads with 2 yummy tapenades. If you overeat  you'll ruin the whole thing  dammit...so don't.  6) Dessert? To be continued.........because I will be back!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,ok...been to this place 3 times now and it definitely does NOT disappoint...and after this only 4 stars...the reason being is because the name of the restaurant...OLIVES...not a big fan of olives...and you ask why i come here...the first time i ever came here was because of a congratulatory dinner from the owner of my company...the 3 pastes that they give you for your flatbread are all olives...and that is the only reason...but if you LOVE olives...you would give it 5....  the CAESAR's salad is to die for...one of the best...if not THEE best caesar salads i have ever had....the bone-in RIBEYE....yeah you can cut it with a butter spoon...if you can find a butter-spoon...  the ambiance and the view is great! a little dim...so for all you romantics...the service is pretty darn good...and the cocktails and food is mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...i think you get the picture...thats enough m's....  when you come to vegas...come and eat here...but be warned...its VEGAS...don't be a cheapskate...2 people...minimum with tip $200...if you like the good stuff  i crave for this place
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the loveliest most delicious meals in a very rushed Vegas.  From the service to the food and the ambience  a terrific meal.  Only wish it would come to NYC!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Yummy food with lots of flavors. Love the free olive spread that is brought to the table with unique breads. Waiter was terrible though. Rest of the service was good. Even the busser was awesome. Scallops and sea bass were great. Wine was brought to the table half way through the meal which was not ideal. You would think it'd be more organized with how many wait staff there were. Both tables next to us also had late drink orders and we just kept hearing the waiter say he was sorry. Nice view of bellagio fountains. Service could be better is my biggest complaint.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,On my last day of vacation had a truly memorable brunch.  Loved the Two Pear cocktail.  Had a Sunsplash too.  Truly found the carpaccio so good.  The prawns stuffed with crab was the bomb !  Had the cookie plate ( hot fresh baked cookies ) with homemade ice cream.  Great combination......why don't others copy that. Was fortunate to sit in the patio outside......in nice weather....do it if you can.  Rarely give anything five stars.  Highly recommend it.  Great waiter too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was in town for CES and had a bus cas dinner here.  Great service although the seating arrangement was a bit strange (ie cramped).  We got it straightened out eventually~  They serve these really great olive spreads with bread - yum.    I'm a classic steak girl but if there is a good scallop dish on the menu I will usually jump at it.  They had an a'la orange scallop dish with an agrodolce sauce (basically like a sweet and sour) which got my order.  Unfortunately that sauce was so acidic the tip of my tongue went a bit numb and my teeth felt like about 3 layers of enamel had been stripped.  A very strange feeling.  And a bit disappointing since I do love scallops.    Everything else was fine but I think next time I'm in town I'm opting for Cut :)  I've been wanting to eat there!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very solid meal.  Group of four and started with three appetizers  which was the highlight of the meal.  One in our party mentioned Todd English is known for his flatbread and the prosciutto and fig flatbread was awesome  by far the best dish.  Tuna tartare was also perfectly prepared but did comparable at many other restaurants.  We also had the grilled octopus and squid  which seems like the trendy dish right now  it was good but not a huge squid fan.  As an entree  had lamb shank.  Again it was very solid but did not take the dish to any new levels.  MOst disappointing was green beans tempura.  The tempura and taste was perfect  but they came out of the kitchen at room temperature.  If they are nice and hot  probably would of moved Olives to five stars.  Overall  an excellent meal but not earth shattering.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I made a reservation at Olives through Open Table a month ago with a request for patio seating for a special occasion with my wife. When we arrived we were unapologetically informed seating on the patio wasn't available for 3 hours. The receptionists  all unsmiling and dressed in black resembled greeters at a funeral home  were needlessly dismissive and rude. Once in the restaurant  there were tables askew all over the smallish space  like they realized too late they didn't have enough square footage they needed so tables were set up in corners  and anywhere they could. It feels more like a subway station than an upscale restaurant. The two-tops are postage stamp size. There are no views of the Bellagio fountains in the restaurant.         The Greek Romaine Salad was fresh enough but surprisingly flavorless. Trader Joes Greek salads are at the same level. The scallop dish was $44 for 4 scallops  which would've been fine had the 'crazy risotto' described in the dish required a departure from reality testing to be identified as 'risotto'- not sure what that was. I ordered the Seafood Risotto  which was hard-to-identify pieces of seafood-tasting pieces of meat in a little tomato-y broth- odd. And was it risotto? no of course not.  All the servers we interacted with spoke like robots  programmed to say the exact same thing  with the exception of Paul  our waiter  who was the only bright spot of the experience. There is no polite way to remove the crumbs from the dark plastic tables  and Paul tried valiantly to take a small sponge to remove them.  My wife observed that Olives has a  ""I'm taking you out  trying to impress you  vendor type vibe"" rather than a quality restaurant ambiance. Olives exudes ostentatiousness Trump-style: huuuge!  With all the amazing dining choices available in Las Vegas  be assured you'll want to give Olives a miss."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really liked this place. The decor was warm and inviting. I had the  Butternut Squash Tortellini which was very good  but it did get too sweet so I would get a side order that is salty. Then we had the fish and chip which was cooked perfectly  but it was pretty standard. I would totally come back next time I'm in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Pros..  1. Very good wine list (drink menus on ipad)  2. Serves olive and olive spread with the bread  3. Good service  Cons..  1. Even if you make a reservation and go right when they open its not guaranteed that they will give you a patio seat  2. Pricey for mediterranean food (we paid about $300 for everything including tip & tax and 3 drinks)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Stepping into Olives for the first time  you would expect to get exceptional food and service. I was so wrong. I looked past the first mistake when our waiter forgot two of our four appetizers (roasted broccoli soup and ceasar salad). After setting my napkin on fire and shooting bazookas in the air  we managed to get his attention. This time we ordered 2 cappuccinos and 1 coffee  but he somehow managed to forget the coffee.  
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hubby and I were looking for a nice place to celebrate so we headed down the strip and randomly chose the Bellagio for a crapshoot at getting a table somewhere.  After wandering around a bit  looking at the lovely flowers  we headed down restaurant row and perused the menus  trying to decide what sounded best.  When we got to the last one  Todd English's Olives  we decided to give it a shot.  I asked the hostess if they had room for 2 walk-ins and we were seated immediately  though I overheard the couple behind us being told it was a 45 minute wait.. whew!  The restaurant was packed  and we couldn't have been seated further from the fountain-view windows without being in another casino.. but we were there for the food.  Our waiter was friendly without trying to be besties and gave us suggestions.  Following his advice  we ordered the Beef Carpaccio for an appetizer to share.  Words can't truly explain how divine that Beef Carpaccio was.. shaved so thin that you could see through it  with incredible flavor drizzles to vary the tastes.  It was fantastic  melt-in-your-mouth beef.  Hubby ate up the fried corn cake that was underneath the mountain of beef  exclaiming how incredibly good it was also.  Sometimes the southern just goes to the bone in that man ;)  Our entrees arrived and were perfectly prepared and gorgeously presented.  Hubby had the porterhouse with sides of broccoli & fried lobster mac & cheese.  I had the scallops with sides of brussel sprouts & some balsamic beets  along with other stuff I don't remember.  First  his steak - perfectly prepared  incredibly tasty.  I sampled a bite of each item and they were fantastic  and based on how clean his plate ended I'd have to say that he totally agreed.  My scallops were incredibly good  and the crispy lil cakes underneath gave a great texture balance that only enhanced the scallops.  There were 3 large scallops on my plate  and I could barely manage to finish two of them though I truly wanted to eat that last one - I was just too stuffed to continue.  The balsamic beets were tasty good  I wouldn't have minded if there was more of that on my plate instead of the brussel sprouts.  As for those.. I'll admit to a total dislike of brussel sprouts.. but these were edible.  Not great  but I'm afraid that's an impossibility... achieving edible status is shocking enough.  All in all  a great dining experience that gave us the perfect cap to an already excellent day :D
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had dinner at Olives on 11/29/203. I had told the group that it was one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. What a huge disappointment. My favorite tuna tartar was tasteless. Caesar salad was awful. The mushroom pasta was just okay. The focaccia bread I raved about was just doughy and tasteless. Don't know what happened to the restaurant but we will not be going back in the near future.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"For my first time in Vegas my restaurant experience was Olives! The food was amazing! The atmosphere was perfect for our date night. The drinks were delicious! And then to top off our memorable evening there was ""Misty"" the photo girl! She rocked!!! Took AWESOME pictures and was a pure delight to deal with!  We will go back again when in Vegas!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We went to Olive's last night for dinner and hands down it was one of the worst meals that I have ever had in my life.  I ordered the Halibut (which I requested to be cooked well done). My green beans were limp and over cooked.  The ""potato cake"" that was to be served with it was luke warm and had pieces that were so hard and burned you could choke on it.  The food was totally disgusting!!!  The only good thing that they served us was the bread and bottled water.  You could obviously tell that they had microwaved our meal as it came out within 5 minutes of ordering.  I am so mad that we spent over $100 on that nonsense for two people.  Absolutely ridiculous.  The only reason this place gets a one-star is because of the Fountain show which of course as you know I could have watched from the side walk.  Ugh  never to return to this place ever!!!!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There's nothing like eating A stone's throw from the beautiful fountains. The chicken and the ravioli dishes were incredible  but the $50 sirloin was tough and disappointing. Expensive  but this is Vegas...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sigh  Olives what did you do to that absolutely to die for fig and prosciutto flat bread? I have had it twice in other Olives and the ham was cooked and slightly crispy. On this occasion in Vegas it was limp and droopy over the figs. The apple salad was ok but overpriced for what I got. The service was great and the restaurant lovely.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Wow  where's Restaurant Confidential when you need them? For an establishment in such a prime location touting a very high end menu and rock star chef branding  you would think that the dining room staff wouldn't be the sad end of amateur hour. The dining room is not large  there were plenty of waiters milling about  so I'm not sure why the service was so spotty. Orders were forgotten  mixed up  glasses of high end single malt scotch were filled with crushed ice  even when explicitly instructed otherwise. Pretty much every milestone in the dinner (ordering drinks  ordering appetizers  getting food  getting post-meal drinks  getting the check) was preceded by a painfully long wait for a waiter who managed to disappear from view for long stretches of time. Being that this was a weekday  my assumption was that the pro-level service was reserved for Friday nights and weekends. Unfortunate  to say the least  that the poor-service ended up being such a distraction for a great meal. The ""Duck Two-Ways"" was stellar  and considering the quality ingredients and preparation  the serving sizes were stunningly large. Patio views overlooking the Bellagio fountain  firing off every 15 minutes  a great place to eat  but come on a Friday."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love a room with a view  and at this restaurant  the terrace juts out into the lake at Bellagio!  Even though it was 105 degrees  we braved the terrace tables because they have little misters.  We got a table right by the railing  and watched the light on the lake.    Delicious black and green olive tapenade arrived with olives and a tasty assortment of bread and parmesan flatbread!  We gobbled it up and while our drinks were quiclky prepared.  My peach iced tea was refreshing  and my beau got a lemonade.  For lunch we savored a deconstructed shrimp salad  with delicous tangy dressing  and a tender chicken breast and cheese sandwich  accompanied by some fried dill pickle slices  odd  but somehow just the right thing for the side dish!  Wonderful  witty service.  I had actually forgotten this restaurant  and this was a repeat of a pleasant lunch about three years ago.  I can't wait to go back for dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best food I ate while staying in Vegas even though I sat at the bar.  We had the beef carpacchio and the fig and prosciutto flatbread. The beef carpacchio was AMAZING!  Me and the boyfriend didn't particularly care for the fig & prosciutto flatbread.  I'd go back again if I were in Vegas though to try other things.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Compared to the rest of the restaurants at the Bellagio  this one is A ok for me at least. I did not find the service to be as High end as in other Bellagio restaurants. Otherwise food also was ok.  The view if you are sitting outside (which I have seen now about 10 times or so) is stunning if it is your first time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this place.  My boyfriend and I make it a point to eat here at least once during our frequent weekenders.  The beef carpaccio is amazing.  The mushroom flatbread is yummy and their sandwiches and pastas (triend a number of them) are delicious.  The portions are very generous considering this place is a high-brow type of place.  The last time I went  they had a pineapple ice tea on the specials menu  it was yummy but it was $6 with no refills  kinda lame.  Oh and the breads they bring out with the olive tapenade is great too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Although it was too hot to sit outside and watch the Bellagio fountain show  Olive's was still a great lunch experience.  The bread basket is awesome  and of course it wouldn't be named ""olives"" if there wasn't olive tapenade to accompany it.  There is something for everyone in it: foccacia  crispy flatbread  regular bread  and you'll likely find yourself digging for more once you run out.    I had the asparagus salad and the fig/prosciutto flatbread for lunch.  I don't recommend ordering so much food for lunch  but I tend to over-order in general.  Both dishes were delicious  especially their signature flatbread with figs and prosciutto on it.  It's basically like a medium sized rectangular pizza and can constitute a meal in and of itself.    Great service & great food!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Food very good  service PHENOMENAL.  I ate here three to four months ago and for some reason I can't stop thinking about it. I must share!  First  we were seated on the patio and had a front row view to the Bellagio fountains...talk about magical!  We ordered the charcuterie board  roasted chicken  midwest ribeye and falling cake for dessert. They were all very good. The chicken was the juciest-most perfect chicken I've ever had! Who knew chicken could be elevated to such a level?  Here's the real ""WOW"" factor. Our server was extremely busy that night  but her service did not lack in the slightest. In fact  it was the best service I've ever had. I have been a server for a five star restaurant so my standards are very high-trust me when I say the BEST service I have ever had.   My boyfriend's mashed potatoes were a little below par  but when she came by to check on our food he didn't say anything. He's a pretty easygoing guy.   She came back 30 seconds later and asked ""Sir  how are those mashed potatoes?"" He told her they were not as hot as he would like them to be and she replied back by saying  ""I thought so. I knew they didn't look right."" She had the kitchen bring another plate out of perfect mashed potatoes.   On a busy night like that  she could have not said anything and took our word for it. But  she went out of her way to make sure that everything was perfect. She also asked visitors to politely give us space when show time began. Another major bonus.   I will be back again soon!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English himself came to my table and wished me a Happy Birthday.  Does it get any better than that?!?!?!?!?!?!  Completely star struck!  On top of that  our server  his name was Paul  gave us the most AMAZING experience EVER.  He was awesome.  Can't say enough about my experience here.  The food - everything we had was great.  And if I have to recommend one thing  get the Carpaccio.  Share it though because it is ginormous!    I had take one star away for two things though (hey  I'm an honest yelper!)... first we made reservations about 4 months in advance of the big bday dinner in Vegas.  We requested a table outside  overlooking the fountains.  When we got there  they said those tables are first come first serve. That's something they should've told us... that way  we would've made our dinner reservations earlier!  But Paul tried and he was so awesome!  And in the end  I'm glad we stayed where we were in his section!  I guess things do work out the way they are supposed to.  The second reason I had to minus a star is because they stuck us on the smallest table ever for a party of 8.  I mean  we could barely fit our food plates on that table.  But neither of these two things would stop me from coming back to Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My mom and I had lunch here recently.  We were there around 1130am so we were able to get a table out on the patio.  And with it being Sunday  the fountains were set off every 15 minutes.  It was quite a show  especially seeing it from the backside.  And they had the heaters on so it was comfortable outside.    We started off with their wonderful bread basket.  It had several types of bread in it - a soft rosemary focaccia and cheese crisps.  The bread came with a couple of olive spreads and marinated olives.  Yummy!    For our entrees  my mom had the burger with potato wedges.  I had the steak sandwich with onion strings.  We both enjoyed our meals.  I really liked my steak sandwich.  My only complaint was that the meat was a little tough so it was hard to eat as a sandwich.  The onion strings were very crisp and tasty.  The potato wedges my mom had were good too.  Good flavor them with a crisp outside and soft inside.  We got soda and water refills often.  And our waiter come by often too.  Definitely a good lunch and hopefully we will be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this place.  I've been here about 5 or 6 times and its one of those restaurants I always recommend to people when they are looking for good food on the strip.    First of all  if you get a balcony table  the view of the fountains and the strip is very nice.    Second of all  they have the BEST beef carpaccio on the strip!  Delicious  thinly cut raw beef drizzled with balsalmic and shaved pieces of parmesan....Yum!  If you dont wanna go for dinner  atleast stop at the bar for a cocktail and the carpaccio!   Third of all  great service.  There are a lot of people on staff there to make sure you have a wonderful dinning experience!  Our water was always full and we always had everything we  needed!  They are definitely professionals working there.  My fiance and I went for an early valentines dinner / late lunch on Monday.  We ordered a bottle of red and we always get the carpaccio and octopus to start. He always gets the short rib and this time I opted for a mushroom crusted halibut special they had on the V-day menu.  Everything was on point and each bite made my taste buds feel like there was a party in my mouth!  We ended the meal with the dessert on special and we split an espresso martini (they put it in two separate martini glasses for us and they were the size of a full martini each)  Bonus!           The dessert was a flourless chocolate cake with baileys icecream and chocolate covered strawberries.  Awesome!  The martini glass with the cake and icecream was rimmed with sugar and pop rocks!  It was a really fun surprise to the dessert.   Can't wait to go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,inside the bellagio hotel and if you have the time  sit outside on the patio so you can see the water show. had lunch here. started with cesar salad with anchovies.this was one of the best cesar salads. scallops were cooked well. veal chops were cooked well however covered in tomato sauce which was not appetizing. cheese burger were done well with their signature fries. had the crab special spaghetti. came out luke warm and the spaghetti was over cooked so it was really gummy. returned that and ordered the  short rib parpadelle. again the dish came out luke warm with zero seasoning and the pasta over coked. just left the dish  had a plane to catch. will not go back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Slow service at 11:30 am on a Saturday morning when the restaurant was not busy at all.  I was served raw chicken in my chicken sandwich.  Needless to say it was taken off our bill.  However  there is no excuse for that to ever happen.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Try to get a seat outside so you can watch the fountains!  THis is my favorite place to eat at the Bellagio  because the price is right  the view is right  and the food is good.  Really big servings too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"3 1/2 stars.  I'm a bit torn about this place.  My expectations were pretty high going because of friends who raved about it.  My experience ended up being a bit of a mixed bag.  I was meeting some friends in Vegas who wanted to have lunch  and I left it up to them to pick a place with the condition that me wearing a t-shirt would be acceptable (since I was coming straight from an event and wouldn't have time to change).  I felt a bit uncomfortable and wished I brought something to put over my bright yellow t-shirt.  I also felt some of the workers  particularly the hostess  were a bit pretentious.  I tried to make conversation and didn't get much of a response in return.  Our server  while not exceptional  was nice and friendly.  Other workers like the food server and person filling our drinks were okay  but I expected more from a place like this.  As for the food  everything was at least good  but in some cases  not as good as I would have expected.  The fig & prosciutto flatbread was most excellent!  The bread and tapenade were good too.  The Todd's Caesar with anchovies was pretty good  but I didn't feel it was anything that special - it seemed a bit underseasoned.  I had the sirloin with whipped potatoes which was cooked to my liking and was pretty good  but again  nothing special.  I wished I ordered what one of my trusted friends recommended  the butternut squash tortellini.    Overall  it was an ""okay"" experience.  Not bad  but nothing that ""wowed"" me.  I'll give it another shot if the opportunity presents itself again."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Everything that people said about this place was pretty much spot on.  Definitely ask for a seat on the balcony with a view of the fountain.  I've been to Vegas more times than I can count and have seen the fountain show but something about eating good food while there.  As for the food The Fig and Prosciutto flatbread and the ricotta ravioli are can't miss choices.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This review is for restaurant week 2015 :)   We were greeted and seated promptly  fantastic hostesses. Our server was super nice  answered all our questions  and was super on top of noticing when our cocktails were low and getting us new ones. The only thing was that I guess EDC was in town that weekend so everyone thought my boyfriend and I were part of that  haha (we were not  obviously).   Anyway  the food was absolutely fantastic. Seriously  the best oyster I have ever had in my life- it was west coast (mattaki  if memory serves) with a wasabi creme fraiche. Yum! The main course and dessert were fantastic as well  it's just that the oyster was super memorable. Haha :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good food and fantastic service. We had a reservation at Le Cirque and they were closed for renovations. Olives took us in and gave us a wonderful table where we celebrated my wife's birthday prior to the show. Pricing is as expected in Vegas but the portions were much larger than expected. I would dine again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We had a fantastic time at Todd English's Olives. The Staff was genuinely kind and accomodating. Very helpful and knowledgeable. It was good to be able to enjoy great food and wine and not be worried about how ""cool"" that my guests or I were looking ( like the restaurant down the hallway) but i digress.... They have the best Carpaccio that there is in this world. No Arguement. No discussion.  Try it for yourself  its amazing.  It has aioli and roquefort cream underneath so purists might be shocked  but its purely magical. Also amazing Foie Gras with Duck Confit.  Sommelier provided beautiful wines for us to enjoy with our dinner  ( ok  maybe we enjoyed the wine a little too much).  Peppercorn Filet and Scallops w pancetta Risotto were our entree selections.  Both were incredible.  Seriously  to get food this good  in such a beautiful surrounding is an amazing experience.  We eat around the world and this was such a memorable night for us  we cant wait to go back.  The views of the Bellagio Fountain shows simply were a bonus.  Best dining experience in Las Vegas for us  not to mention the Bellagio.."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was well done  we had the sea bass  corvina  and flatbread pizza for our little guy.  No appetizers  no desert and our bill was.  outrageous.  Just another big name restaurant featuring a celebrity chef with celebrity prices in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We have a lunch for 6 of us. This review should get a 5 star if we would get our patio reservation as requested.  The  bread  octopus/squid appetizer was really good. raw beef salad was really good and My Scallops lunch dish was amazingly good. Services was good  the ambiance was really nice. it would of been a perfect lunch if we could enjoy the Water fountain show at the same time. Great!!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice.  A little hard to get in the day I went but it was a Friday...  Wound up with a seat at the bar and other than feeling like I really needed to rush through dinner so they could work another paying customer in it was excellent.  I went with the crazy mushroom pasta - so many levels of flavor going on in here...it was hard to stop.  I did though  and consequently wound up getting 2 meals out of 1 with this dish b/c I had plenty leftover for lunch another day.  It's not too expensive if you take this into consideration.  If you are looking to cut down on the price you might also wanna skip multiple $16 cocktails.  I didn't - I went for the gusto.  Something like a margarita but less sweet and with cilantro had it's hooks in me...  I heard everyone saying the place to sit was the balcony - apparently you wind up with an excellent view of the dancing waters if you sit there...so maybe next time.  Will def go back for that pasta...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was wonderful and the decor was beautiful. The olives were good and the olive spread flavorful. But the food was good  but don't go when you are really hungry the portions are modest. But the food is very well flavored
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service wasn't as great as I expect from such upscale dining. The waiter gave our  group of 6 grief about splitting checks  we were all on business and thus needed separate checks for accounting purposes. The food however was spectacular. I don't even like olives but the bread with the dip that came out was just short of amazing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I simply cannot recall a more pleasant dining experience within many years! Based on reviews  I made a reservation  then requested outdoor seating upon arrival  in order to enjoy the Bellagio fountain. We only had to wait an additional 45 minutes  and I strongly recommend you do the same! The simple act of dining al fresco while enjoying the fountain's visual and aural display  would have been enough  but was wonderfully complemented by a splendid meal. Both presentation and quality proved without reproach. My steak was properly blackened  with a most flavorful presentation of green beans with garlic potatoes. The pre dinner bread selection was unique in its variety  and this olive-hater enjoyed the olive toppings served with the breads. Not an easy feat  mind you! The prices were reasonable considering the competition at Bellagio. The staff seemed eerily able to provide service while remaining nearly invisible providing the perfect amount of attention. I hope your experience is as perfect!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,first off i have to say  awesome seats! we didnt make a reservation and had a party of 8.  luckily we only waited about 15 mins or less because we were also in a rush to go see O after dinner.  but our table was nonetheless awesome.  we sat in this kind of sequestered area where it almost made us feel like we got a private room.  we were right next to the windows too so we had an awesome view of the bellagio fountains and they went off every 10-20 min. interval during dinner.  my group was... rambunctious  that's a nice way to put it.  so i apologize to the waiter that had to deal with two members of our party. but other wise dinner went well.  I'm a fan of their pastas so i got their butternut squash ravioli.  it was just the right amount of sweet. my boyfriend got their seafood flatbread.  i liked the fig flatbread when I went to the NY Olives.    I wish i had more time to enjoy dinner because we rushed off to O right after but if I come back to Vegas i'll make a note to stop by again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Hands down the worst meal I've had in forever. Shockingly bland. Ridiculously expensive. Todd English should be embarrassed to have his name on what is essentially high priced nursing home food.   The focaccia was day old  the Caesar salad begged for seasoning. Instead it came with soggy croutons (really?!!) and underripe tomatoes (who puts tomatoes on their Caesar?!!).   Their ""signature"" dish  the sea bass  was pretty to look at but I question its authenticity. And  again  style over substance defined this tasteless dish.   If you want to watch the fountains  go for a drink which are excellent. Or try Mon Ami Gabi. If they haven't messed with the Chicago menu you're guaranteed a delicious meal.   But unless your doctor has put you on a bland diet  run  don't walk away from Olive."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives was an impromptu stop before ""O "" and it was a surprisingly satisfying choice for a light dinner. The minute the restaurant opened  there were people steadily streaming in  and we were lucky enough to be right next door and slipped in to grab a window table with no reservation. Service was prompt and considerate  if a little absent towards the end because of the full house.   Freshly squeezed grapefruit juice: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=AXdkmCKI1Ecjo4FQgIAFhQ&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) Albeit a tad on the pricey side  definitely freshly squeezed. It was a nice refreshing start to the evening  and it paired well with the dishes later on in the meal.  Complimentary bread basket and trio of olives and spreads: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=HJqGN2P4gzy8WU73s8cVEw&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Eh4exgjM4Oyo-gh4gMYp2w&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) I wasn't a huge fan of the rolls  but I thought that the flattened sesame pie-sheets (definitely not their proper name..) went incredibly well with the olives and spreads. I could taste the freshness of the toasted sesame seeds  and the spreads were perfectly seasoned and mixed to a creamy pulp.   Grilled squid and octopus: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=FCD_yLBMl1v9Xh5rhbbcFg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) I can't remember the last time I had such tender squid and octopus. The seafood in this dish was cooked absolutely perfectly and suffered no hint of rubberiness. The portion was generous  and the seasoning was spot-on; there was a good balance of richness and tanginess which kept the dish from being too heavy. If I had to be nitpicky  I'd have preferred a different presentation  but the overall dish was more than enough to offset the plating.  Chilean sea bass with cannellini beans  broccolini  and watercress: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=L1KH45eB2WicaUr1kgp3Rg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) Like others have mentioned  the sea bass was cooked incredibly well. The meat was flaky and tender  which paired well with the soft cannellini beans. I understand the contrasts of the broccolini and watercress  but I felt that the greens were a bit disjointed in flavoring compared to the sea bass and beans. The broccolini on our plate was also a tad undercooked.   Mushroom pappardelle with mushroom medley and lemony pea shoots: (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=nqUMOBmQxSU7hpZRleIOjg&userid=1ug7EtH4blOzzbqqkmkenA) When our server recommended this dish to us  we were initially hesitant  but I am so glad we listened to him. The pappardelle was so freshly made that I could still taste the fragrance of rolled flour  and it had the perfect thickness and cook. The mushroom medley was also fragrant without tasting too much like mushroom (if you know what I mean.. sometimes the occupants of the fungi kingdom can be a bit too pungent). I would order this dish again in a heartbeat  and I can't remember the last time I was that excited about a pasta dish.  I'm looking forward to my next visit to Las Vegas just for the grilled squid and octopus dish as well as the mushroom pappardelle entree.."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The restaurant is located at the Bellagio so ask for a table near the windows and you'll get to watch the fountain show while you eat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went back this weekend. Nothing had changed.. ..I honestly believe they could care less if your a local or a tourist  they really don't care  if they will ever see you again..  Excellent food.....so so service....Actually this is will be  my last trip here. Too many alternatives........
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Once again a wonderful meal here at Olives. The cocktails we had were delicious  the appetizer of Beef Carpaccio was to die for delicious. My wife had the  Scallops & Prosciutto and was amazing. The scallops were HUGE and the flavor was amazing. I had the Gnocchi pasta and it was also very very good as well!  The kids had a pepperoni pizza and my wife and I commented that it likely dethroned our favorite pizza that we always have in Santa Monica. The only issue is that the pizza was a bit small but then again what do you expect in a classy restaurant like this.    Now let me get to the family aspect of this restaurant. First off  it is a FANCY restaurant but you can come in with shorts/flip flops/and tank top. It does nothing to detract from the beauty of this restaurant. Also  you can bring your kids in here and they can enjoy some delicious food. My kids are picky (as most kids are) but devoured the Beef Carpaccio even when they knew it was raw meat. They didn't care cause it was amazing tasting. I rank this up there for being kid friendly though there is no kids menu per se. The pizza was enough to feed 4 kids but just barely.  For 3 kids it would have been perfect but there likely would have been left overs.   To sum it up GO THERE! It is a great restaurant to eat at!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to Olive's for dinner.  Sat inside.  I noticed it was pretty loud inside already  then a group of what I can only assume were teenage boys with a chronic aging disease were seated  because they definitely weren't adults judging by the way they were acting.  Aside from the noise  the decor and atmosphere inside was quite romantic.  Dimmed lights and dark furniture  with candles at each table  really set the mood.   On to the food  I enjoyed it.  The fish was cooked perfectly and very tasty.  While it wasn't anything I was blown away by  it was a very satisfying meal  albeit slightly overpriced  but what restaurant isn't on the Strip?  I think if we came back here again  we'd probably take the time to wait for outdoor seating  which probably would've made the experience better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went there on valentines day - no reservation  no wait. The hostess sat us right away  and we were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant was super busy at that time  but the service was exceptional. Both server and the bus boy made sure we've got everything we needed. They were all friendly  professional and polite. We ordered two Bellini (one regular  one strawberry)  one flat bread (fig and prosciutto)  and beef carpaccio. All were winners but I couldn't believe how tender and packed in flavors beef carpaccio was. The beef was thin  and unbelievably soft. It went very well with rest of the ingredients on the plate: arugula and polenta cake. The portion was generous  and the price was moderate for vegas. Next time  we will make a reservation and sit outside patio to enjoy the fountain show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Restaurant Week Review  I have to preface this review with  this is my first visit here and we came here specifically for restaurant week  the lunch menu.  Original plan was to sit outside on the nice terrace overlooking the Bellagio fountains  but the weather prevented us from doing that  so the hostess sat us next to the window  which was perfect. Our server suggested 2 of his favorite mixed drink specialties from the bar  I wish I could remember the names of them  they were so good.  For my app I went with Crispy Lamb Riblets; Sweet Corn Raita  Lamb Reduction  Honeyed Yogurt  Micro Mint. This was delicious. And rather large for an app  it was perfectly cooked  a little crunch on the outside and tender on the inside. My friend ordered the Wild Mushroom Tart; Caramelized Onions  Herbed Imported Goat Cheese  Truffle Essence. This also was delicious  had the perefect amount of every ingredient.  We both chose the same main course  Pacific Sole Milanese; Creamy Fava Bean Risotto  Garlicky Spinach  Lemon Caper Butter Emulsion  Shaved Fennel Insalata.  Right away I noticed it looked greasy  I think the combination of the Milanese with the caper butter emulsion made this dish very heavy and it covered the taste of the Sole. I kept having to drink water after every bite. I loved the risotto and spinach under the fish  so that's what I ended up eating. Dissapointed because I ended up not eating the fish.  We both chose the same dessert as well  Tiramisu Cannoli; Cinnamon Spiced Cake  Espresso cream. This was a different twist on tiramsu  which is one of my favorite desserts. It had a good flavor  nothing spectacular.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Exceptional food. The sea scallops melt in your mouth and the mushroom risotto was life changing! The pesto and truffle mashed potatoes were excellent. So good  we ate everything before we remembered to take a picture! Great service to top it off.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I sat at the bar here and had lunch  trying in vain to rid myself of a Vegas sized hangover. The bartenders were very sweet and attentive  keeping my water glass filled to the top at all times. The pesto was out of this world.  I definitely filled up on bread  but when my entree came I quickly made room.  There are no words in the English language  or any other for that matter  that can appropriately describe to you how delicious my pasta was.  Hand made and house made  clearly  it was how pasta would taste if Jesus had made it.  I had the butternut squash in mine and it was cooked PERFECTLY. The sauce on top was the best possible compliment.  This is seriously the best pasta on Earth. I will someday end up in Vegas just because my craving for Olives is so insanely strong.  Go and order the butternut squash ravioli  and bring some back for me.  Seriously.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend surprised me with lunch at Olives and a table-for-two situated on the restaurant's patio right next to the Bellagio fountains :)    We started with a Portobello flatbread with red onions  fontina cheese  white truffle oil.  My previous experiences at $$$ restaurants made me expect something super tiny so when the waiter brought out the flatbread  I was sooo surprised!  It was almost than a personal pizza and could have totally sufficed as an entree.  It was also DELICIOUS.  The red onions and truffle oil worked totally in sync with each other.   The rest of our meal was also delicious - I loved my boyfriends scallops (more than my Spring Pea Mezzaluna).  However  we did stupidly order a side order of parmesan french fries.  My boyfriend eats a lot but the bread basket  plus flatbread  a pasta  an entree  AND french fries - we were STUFFED.   Overall  the restaurant is wonderful and the fountain (+ music that is played on the patio) adds a very romantic touch.   I am minus-ing one star though because the waiter thought we were done after our flatbread and took away all our bread basket  silverware  and dishes.  My boyfriend and I awkwardly sat at the empty table until they realized their mistake and came back very apologetically with new utensils and plates.  They were also a little slow with refilling water.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We come to Vegas about twice a year. Tradition is to have lunch at Olives "" al fresca"" the day we leave for home.  Had to wait 20 min for an outdoor table -- but the food was very good.  One of my pet peeves in restaurants is that the waiter/waitress brings your final bill without even asking if you want dessert. That was the case here.  Makes you feel that you are being rushed out the door and not given that special ""customer service"" you would expect - with so many excellent restaurants in Vegas..  they should be on their game."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Pretty scenery  sat outside to watch the fountains but it was hot and humid! Service was not up to par with other Bellagio restaurants  pretty slow. Had to remind them to refill waters several times  and waited an hour for our lunch to be served!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is hands down one of the best places in Vegas.  I felt the need to write this review based on a recent one that stated the carpaccio was bad.  It is one of the best things you will EVER eat!  We order it every time we go to Olives and always wonder at its deliciousness.  The crispy moist polenta cake hiding underneath  pairs perfectly with the cool tender slices of delicious raw sirloin skirted seductively over the huge plate.  The warm cipollini onions dance around the perimeter begging to be adorned with a drizzle of the 2 amazing aiolis showered rapturously from above.  The piquant baby arugula teases the palate giving just a slight bitterness that balances the richness of the dish.  Well  at least we like it... everyone has a different palate!  The bartenders here are the best!  We always go and have lunch at the bar with Joe  who has worked here for quite a while... a charming service pro is he.    Other lunch favorites are any of the amazing flatbreads  the squash pasta  or the spinach ricotta ravioli.  We think that the food is exceptional.  Sitting outside to watch the fountains seems to be a priority for most  but we are happy to sit inside at the bar with Joe and enjoy a delightful meal every time.  Thanks for some great memories  Olives!  See you soon!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great service and very prompt! Served by Paul and he was great. Even offered to take our picture. We had pulled chicken flatbread and butternut squash tortelli. I would rank this one of my best meal!!fountain view is beautiful but make a reservation during holidays.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,ABSOLUTLY AMAZING!! My partner and I went in for our 5th year anniversary/marriage proposal and Nicole/Daniella/Joel(server) were outstanding!! They assisted us in making a night to remember. They all went out of their busy way to make our night a special one and they definately did. The food was amazing as well  prime beef tenderloin was so tender I didn't even need the steak knife and scallops was cooked perfectly. Decor was great  very comfortable and patio seating was great. We will return for more great memories.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Unique spot menu wise  just make sure you make a reservation because it's very popular. Bar scene is very vibrant at times and heavy or light food you will have to choose from some unique cocktails there and their menu items are interesting combinations. From flatbreads to burgers  you'll have plenty of tasty dishes and sides to make you realize you're glad your there
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent.  We went for lunch on our last trip to Vegas.  You will not be disappointed.  In the sea of great restaurants  this is one of the all around better choices.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The food is excellent. Light and well seasoned. Very very Italian in nature. Not the Americanized ""Italian"" but some thing you would get in the country side of Italy. No huge proportions  no choked full of cheese.   Service started a bit slow  but we were taken right at our reservation time. The fountain views are great  but I had wished they would have said something to guests who got up out of their seats and went to the railing to watch blocking other patrons."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was not impressed with Olives.  It was very high priced and the food was nothing special.  We shared a open faced Muffaletta  which was good  but not for $20.  I got the Butternut Squash Tortelli  it was horrible  nothing like the menu described.  I ended up having them box it and then gave it to a homeless man on our way back to our hotel.  I felt bad because I paid so much for it I didn't want to see them just throw it away and I was definitely not going to eat it then or later.  I only ate three bites of the whole thing  it was that bad  I couldn't choke it down.  The waiter was snobby also  only good service we had was from the busser.  I'm sure there are plenty of better places to eat in Vegas for that price range.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First off -  Joe is the best bartender on earth.  Period.  He reads my mind  and I'm never disappointed.  I will only sit at the bar to eat here  only walking away from my big comfy barstool to watch the water show on the balcony when my buzz is strong.  But  like a paddle ball on a rubber band  I come right back to HIT IT with another mini carafe of wine.      Secondly  I can't remember ever having a bad dish  bad service  bad anything while sitting in my big upholstered throne at Olives.  I give mad props to Todd English for the concept  and pulling the investors together  etc  but this place is a perfect storm of their executive chef  awesome staff  and spot on food.    This is the best lunch spot in Vegas... Hands down.  Spago  I love too  but Olives is just the shizzle.  Mwah!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was very good. Portion to cost a little high. Good wine selection  good appetizers. Chocolate bread crazy good. Very helpful with wine selection. Scallops excellent. Sea Bass also nice. Chocolate peanut butter lava cake rocked.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great bar... Ask for Chris Nice wine and you can eat at the bar  which can be hard to find in Vegas. Wine selection was nice and the food was remarkable as expected.  Enjoy a great time there.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just want to say I had the most memorable and most romantic experience at this place. I was here with my husband to celebrate his 30th birthday. Our experience was exceptional more because of our server Nelson Serano! He took special care of us. Off Course the food tasted excellent too. We ordered salad and Flatbread(vegetarians) and a desert after. Super nice place  super nice people. Just give it a try  I am sure you won't be disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is one of the better restaurants in Vegas!!! Service/Food excellent!!!  Outdoor seating of the water show Amazing!! We always make this a regular dinner stop on our Vegas trips!!! You will never be disappointed!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My review is based almost entirely on the poor service we received.  We made our reservation weeks in advance  requesting patio seating.  When we arrived  we saw party after party (without reservations) being seated in the patio.  By the time the hostess got to us  she told us that there were no more patio tables available.  When we remarked on all the people without reservations taking the patio tables  the hostess explained that they don't reserve patio seating.  We pointed to three primo patio tables by the railing that appeared to be empty  and the hostess replied with a straight face: ""Those are reserved.""  We should have left right then  but we stayed.  The food was fine  and we enjoyed he flatbread.  But we'll never go back."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Apple and fennel salad was perfect with walnuts  goat cheese  onions tangerines and champagne vinaigrette  Sonoma rabbit duo was DELICIOUS. I inhaled the quartered leg  and realized I was too full to even work on the asparagus stuffed part. That ended up being my lunch the next day  and it was still awesome.  slice of life cocktail was absolutely refreshing and I probably could have had at least 2 more if I hadn't realized the alcohol taking its effect. Was way too full for desert. There's always next time.  Definitely will try to make reservations next time outside to sit behind the Bellagio fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's a bit of a walk from the hotel rooms  down a hall on the way out of the west side of the hotel campus. Decor is contemporary and wood-rich  seating a little cramped  balcony availability a little confusing.   We came in toward the end of the lunch session but too early for the dinner session so things were in a bit of upheaval as they wound down to finish one mealtime and to prep for the next. After a wait and a search for who to talk to to get seated  we were finally seated at a long half&half (half bench/half chair) row of tables. I could extend my arm and eat off my neighbor's plate if I wanted to. It was a little noisy due to all the hard surfaces in the restaurant  but not too bad. The decor was beautiful.  I selected the Beef Carpaccio (not having any idea what Carpaccio was) over the Tuna Carpaccio. When it arrived  I wasn't sure if I was seeing raw meat on there or not. Perhaps it had been cured in some way but kept the raw look of beef. I hesitatingly forked off a small taster portion  not knowing if I would actually like this concoction or not. OMG... heaven! It was SOOOO good! One of those dishes that just teases and excites every little tastebud in your mouth! Textures  flavours  everything! LOVED IT! Actually  I loved it so much  I have no memory whatsoever of what my husband ordered. I know he liked it  though. :o)   Service was ok. Seemed a little confused initially. But once we got our server and our order in  she seemed a little more aware of getting back to us every once in a while.   I would go back there. I don't know if I'd try anything new seeing as I loved the Carpaccio so much... but maybe I would. Just to give a more rounded assessment of the place! Two thumbs up from us for Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I recently traveled to Las Vegas for a trip. I stayed at the Wynn  which I highly suggest  but I wanted to eat at Olives and watch the fountains. I am gluten free and dairy free  I have to say that over all my experience in Vegas dining was fantastic. Olives wait staff and bar staff were top notch. Very friendly and helpful and concerned with my food issues. I had the tuna carpaccio and the roasted chicken with green beans and olive oil mashed potatoes. It was all excellent. I will definitely be back here next time I am in Vegas. The mimosas were great too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant is amazing! The service was fabulous  and we sat on the patio and had a stunning view of the Bellagio Fountain show. The cocktails were delicious! Highly recommended  its a great dining experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've eaten here three or four times over the years.  1st time on the patio  had some sort of lobster risotto that I still talk about.  Recently there (vegas) for my bday (hey  girl  happy bday!) and stopped in for a late nite thing on our first night.  we ate lite  but it did not disappoint.  cocktails were great!  flatbreads were great.  had the greek salad...great!  also tried the tuscan meatballs.  sheee-yit they were good and I don't even like beef!!    went to eiffel tower restaraunt in paris the next night and I was seriously wishing we were back at olives.  it's just comfortable and I've never had a bad dish there (unlike eiffel tower).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"If anyplace could be overrated  this would be it.  I have no issues with the service.  Our staff did a wonderful job.  There was a group of 12 of us and we were in the semi private room straight back past the bar with a view of the fountains.  It was dark though.  Very dark.  And it was loud.  Very loud.  I have a rule when I eat out.  Never order any pork chop of any kind.  No matter how good the restaurant  it's always overcooked and dry.  However  I was at ""Olives"" and ordered it anyway.  Yes  it was dry.  I couldn't get over half of it down.  The highlight of the meal is the diced olives spread on the bread they provide as part of the meal.  It's EXCELLENT!!!  Next time  i'll order dessert for dinner and just dine on bread and spread."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There are a ton of choices when you go to Vegas  so how do you know you're making the right one? By heading to Yelp and reading reviews of course. My husband and I came for dinner  we were a little early for our reservation so sat down at the bar for a drink. The drink/wine menu was handed to us (an ipad). I had a dirty martini - the bartender asked if I wanted bleu cheese olives  so obvi I said yes. They were speared with a Rosemary sprig  and I was instantly in love.  We started with the carpaccio and both had specials - steak and miso bass. Both were delicious  although the miso was a little salty - I had commented that I hoped it wouldn't be salty to the husb when I was thinking about ordering it so I should have seen it coming.  Otherwise everything was excellent  service was great. And you can't beat the view of the Bellagio Fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food here is very good. As far as the price all I have to say is that you're in the Bellagio so it's not going to be cheap but it's Todd English's place so it could be in Excalibur and still be semi-pricey. But it's not as expensive as say the China Grill at Mandalay.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Visited here for lunch on 6/22. Seated promptly without a reservation. Took awhile for our waiter to get rolling towards us for our drink order. We split an appetizer of calamari to start off with  which was pretty good. Then had a special crab salad and a mushroom flat bread. The crab salad was OK  nothing special. The mushroom flat-bread was excellent though. Intense flavor  rich with mushrooms on a super thin crust. It was quite tasty. One other note is that the bread basket along with the olives spread is awesome. I kept eating this bread it was so good. I have been low carbing it and this bread was a real treat to veer of my path for once. Foccacia  some type of onion foccacia  and a very thin cracker like bread flavored with parmesan and garlic. Wow. They were all good. Anyway..........I would most likely want to go back for that mushroom flat-bread again. I love mushrooms  so it made me a happy boy. I give it 4 stars. Try it out yourself.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I was in town for a convention and ate lunch here two days in a row. Both times  it was a truly outstanding experience.   The first day  I was alone for lunch so I sat at the bar. Two very professional servers with knowledge and personality waited on me. I had no idea what I wanted  so I did what is generally the safe thing. I asked for a recommendation.  The gentleman behind the bar highly recommended the Beef Carpaccio. This amazing dish includes gorgonzola polenta  parmesan  cipollini onions  balsamic reduction  scallion cream  and garlic aioli. I've included a photo so you can witness for yourself this succulent treat. It was the perfect lunch dish in every respect.   On the second day  I came back for lunch with a coworker and we sat at a table. A nice server came over to take our orders and today  I felt like pizza. So I again asked for a recommendation. The server said  ""Well...it may sound strange  but I think the Fig & Prosciutto flatbread pizza is the best.""   Figs in pizza? Really? Okay. Fig & Prosciutto it is. And she was right. It was a heavenly flatbread. The figs were  in fact  the highlight of the meal. A unique blend of flavors and I highly recommend you try it.  Something I also like about this restaurant is that when you're seated  they give you a free sample of their various Olives spreads  along with bread that ranges from soft to crispy. You could almost make a meal of these. And since I like olives  I'm a huge fan of the spreads.   The atmosphere here is outstanding as well. Inside and out. And if you choose to dine outdoors on the terrace  you're right in front of the Bellagio fountains. Enjoy the water show  music  fine cuisine  and the misters (if it's hot outside) gently spraying cool water down to you.   If you like olives  you love Olive's."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went for a late dinner with reservations at 9pm  needed to wait an extra hour to sit outside and we did. Just walked around and had a cocktail at a lounge. Absolutely loved the view and show! The service was great and the food was amazing! We decided on the three course prix fix for $55 and added the wine pairing for an additional $20 each. The oysters were okay  but the fish and steak entrees were mouth watering. We had tiramisu for dessert and it was very good too. You get a separate type of wine for each course  well worth the $20. Overall  wonderful evening
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just dined at Olives for the second time  and it was even better than I remembered.  The food was delicious and interesting.  Fantastic and surprising flavor combinations.  Our service was exceptional - could not have been better (thanks to Paul and Tammy). The space is fantastic and overlooks the fountains.  This restaurant is a real find - I would not miss it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really enjoyed this restaurant. We went there with a large group of 11 people and the food and service was great. I ordered the short ribs as my entree and the meat was extremely tender and flavorful. It could not have been better prepared. Also that evening I had one of their flatbreads which was also very tasty. I would definitely recommend this restaurant  and would go back again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,4 1/2  Stars if I could.  The true testament to this place is that we keep going back  despite staying at other hotels on the Strip.  Always good to excellent.  Not big bang wow food (Jose Andres E')  but really good food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have been here a couple of times for dinner but decided to try lunch this time with my family. This restaurant is one of the few upscale options there is on the strip for lunch with outdoor seating. We decided to sit outside right in front of the fountains of Bellagio. The wait staff there is very prompt and courteous. We started off with 2 orders of the beef carpaccio and I have to say  it is the best I have tried in this town. I decided to try the crab cakes beignets  which were one of the specials for today. The crab cakes were covered with a nice  crispy covering and was served with a bean and salsa sauce. Every thing about the lunch was perfect. I have to say  I enjoyed lunch here better than I enjoyed the dinners.  But just a word of caution  be careful while being seated outside  you will get wet when the fountains are going off and the wind blows  we did. Good thing we were done with our meal. The wait staff was very apologetic and even tried to dry us up.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow  so good.  Thanks to Yelp I knew just what to order but the Calamari was already off the menu and the very helpful waiter told me they rotate many dishes every 4 months or so as in the Vegas scene gets tired quick.  I ordered for a table of three at lunch and had the Beef Carpaccio and the Fig flatbread as starters. They were simply awesome.  The women at my table loved the flatbread and I thought the Beef was really really good.    Next course was the handmade tortellini  chicken gnocci  and a current special which was surf and turf.  The dishes are listed above in the order of their goodness... is that the right way to say that??  Whatever   you get it.  smoking good squach tortellini.  This is a dish that could very easliy be dessert SO GOOD...  The Gnocci was good but not kiiler and the Surf and Turf didn't have enough surf but the taste was great...  I am coming back to this place.  Thankfully the experience on an expense account is guiltless so that obviously enhances the experience...  Yum yum  Keep it up Todd.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food and great service! I love the atmosphere  especially the view overlooking Bellagio's famous water show.   Complimentary bread and tapenade was delicious.  Slingback martini had the right kick to it. We ordered the grilled octopus and squid  tuna tartare  and beef tartare for appetizer. Loved all of it.   I ordered the short rib for the main course. The meat was very tender  juicy and melted in my mouth. Cooked to perfection  on top of the polenta. Mushroom risotto was also delicious  something about the dish that is so comforting.   Overall the food was amazing and my sister who was celebrating her birthday enjoyed the food and the service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this place!  Service is really good and the food is delcious! I've dine here about 10 times   their pastas are really good along with their salmon. I highly recommend this place if you are entertaining guests  i would request patio seating to get a view of the bellagio fountains. Thinking of throwing my big 30 here at the Olives patio.. Try it now!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,In the Bellagio hotel.  Beautiful setting overlooking the fountains.  Ask to sit outside if weather works and you are trying to impress someone.  Wonderful food.  Sometimes a little salty for my taste buds.  Servings can be a bit oversized for me.  Overall this is a wonderful restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So it was my girlfriends birthday and we decided  after much browsing and walking around  to try out Olives  and boy am I glad we did. Every part of the meal was fantastic  from the drinks  appetizers  main course  to the complimentary birthcake dessert. I was going to try the beef tartare  but at the suggestion of our fantastic waiter  we got the beef carpaccio. Delicious is all I can say. The waiter found out that we were in the food industry so when we ordered the flat bread he brought out a Trio dish with fig and prosciutto  olives classic  and portabello. Downright amazing is all I can say. Since my girlfriend is a part time vegetarian she got the Pasta butternut squash tortelli  and she loved it. I ordered the rabbit dish  which is a first for me  and the flavors were delicious. Todd English himself might be phoning it in at this point in his career  but the Chefs and cooks at Olives are more than covering his ass. Fantastic job folks.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,OMG!!!! HOLY Cow!!! seriously  who ever took care of that cow deserves a hand.... YUMMY YUMMY YUMMY  I felt like I was in heaven when I took a bite of the best Filet Mignon I've ever had... and trust me I've had my share of Steaks in my Life.. WOW.. Just thinking about it right now makes my mouth water.... It was so good I went back the next time I was in Vegas... cant wait to go again and have THE best Filet!!!!! OH and I cant forget about the View... You can watch the Bellagio Water show every 30 minutes!!!!!!  Seriously.... let me go book my next Flight to VEGAS. NOW... anybody want to come with me????
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The lamb chop was really flavorless and the two star is for the bread and olive spread.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best meals I've ever had  no kidding!  I went with the 3 course for $50 and it was a great deal.  I chose the smoked duck salad as my appetizer.  Honestly I only expected there to be a few slices of duck on top but this thing was loaded with probably about  1/2 pound of duck.  For my entree I got the lamb chops.  4 large lollipop lamb chops on top of spinach  a hummus like sauce  golden raisins  and toasted pita.  The lamb was amazing and had a sweet glaze on it.  For dessert I tried both the strawberry rhubarb crisp and the oreo bread pudding.  The rhubarb crisp was the better of the two.  As mentioned in previous posts the bread basket and olive tapenades they bring out are great  so great that I get cravings for that tapenade all the time.  Also  the location and service were great.  We sat outside on the patio and had a view of the fountain show.  The service wasn't particularly friendly but my water glass was never empty and plates were cleared almost immediately after finishing a dish.  This is a great restaurant and I can't wait to go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,While waiting for our room at Paris we went to one of our favorites  Olives. Kimberly was an outstanding server. We had a nice glass of sparkling Lamberti rose which went well with our favorite  the beef carpaccio  almost a meal it's so large. The beef is laid over a mound of polenta. We also had the fig and prosciutto flat bread. The crust was perfect.  Olives style fits nicely in Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was amazing. Dinner & the Bellagio water show. Food was great. Prices sucked.   Overall  an amazing dinner experience. I will definitely make it back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not that this place needs another 5-star (civilian) review but here we go! Went here for lunch a few months ago and was able to snag a table on the beautiful patio. Service was incredible.  Went here for dinner on Sat 2/15 and while the patio was already full (I had a 5:30p reso for a week now)  asked to be seated as close to the windows as possible so my parents could have a view of the fountains. Cha-ching! Request granted. Our server  Rick  and myself made great rapport and the entire staff was on top of it during our dinner. Had the malbec - definitely recommend it. The free bread is delicious and they give you as many refills as you want (the onion bread is my favorite). We also had the lobster mac & cheese & the Portobello flatbread  both recommended and both customer favorites. Dad had the chicken  and while he loved it  he was (happily) surprised by the huge portion. Mom had ravioli sans sausage and said it was delish. I had the chilean sea bass and it was perfect!  All in all - go to Olives. Make a reservation. Get there early. Drink the wine & eat all the starters/flatbreads.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our visit to Olives was during Restaurant Week. I made a reservation for an early dinner on Sunday and they gave us the option of indoor or outdoor. At first we chose indoor since it was a hot day  but then we chose to sit outside. It was worth battling the heat. We were seated at one of the tables closest to the  fountains and it really added to our experience.   Before we even looked at the menu the bread basket and tapenades arrived. I liked that they not only had a traditional kalamata tapenade  but also green olive tapenade. Both were very good. I started with an apple salad with blue cheese and bacon among other things. The salad was really good  they didn't overdo any one ingredient and the flavors went well together. My husband had the oysters on the half shell and he definitely enjoyed those.   My entree was the Olives meatloaf. Yum. The meatloaf was definitely an upgrade on the typical meatloaf with a truffle ketchup topping. I loved the mashed potatoes and cauliflower on the plate as well. My husband had the cast iron trout which had a very tasty seasoning and a nice crisp.  For dessert  I knew I had to get the banana tiramisu since I've never seen any variation on tiramisu offered by a restaurant. It didn't disappoint and all of the flavors on the plate were very good. My husband had the seasonal sorbets which were watermelon and mango. Wow  I don't even care for watermelon and I couldn't stop stealing bites. The mango was very refreshing.   I'd definitely recommend this restaurant to locals and tourists alike. Very good food  great service and we loved the outdoor seating by the fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Having dinner before show at bellagio.  Had a different dish then I'm used to  didn't really care for it.  But wanted to try something different.  Nice ambiance  and service was great!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Loved this place! It's so cute and our server was the sweetest. :) Ordered the olive burger added crispy prosciutto  capers and lemon aioli on the side.... Soooo delicious!! :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made dinner reservations for my bffs bachelorette and we got there exactly at the time of the reservation and they sat us right away. We sat next to the window with the beautiful view of the fountains that went off every few minutes. It was beautiful and the future bride almost cried  it's gorgeous at night. The food was amazing! I ordered the free ranged chicken and tried my friends salmon dish...btw it was the best salmon I've had in my life! Olives is a great restaurant and I am pretty sure I will be eating there next time!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good view ! Food not good and service indifferent. Overpriced. Took 30 minutes for the entree to arrive and the pork chop was overdone. No explanation or apology .
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ok.... Sooooo I got attacked by a squid!!! LOL  Best appetizer dish ever...grilled squid and octopus!!!!!  Me and my bother stopped in for some drinks and a snack before our group was meeting elsewhere or dinner in a few hours.  I have it to say that even though we only had this dish it was cooked and prepared to perfection!!  If you have ever had squid or octopus before you will more then likely taste he difference.... This was grilled to perfection and the meat was nice and tender....not rubbery like other places!!!  Def coming back for lunch or dinner..  Ohhh the drinks were good and so was the assortment in the bread basket!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The ambience and the decor was nice. The food though was just meh! I ordered the butternut squash tortelli and my husband ordered the ravioli. They were both just okay. For a place which charges so much you would expect really good presentation of food. And you would expect that the food be delicious. But this restaurant failed on both those counts. Highly dissapointed by this place. Will definitely not be back again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had dinner here last night for my sisters bachelorette party and it was just LOVELY. LOVED the dark ambiance and the staff was SO attentive and even brought my sister a congratulatory dessert. I had the chilean sea bass and it was cooked perfectly (hate when fish is over cooked) I had a Washington Apple Martini and it was also delicious. U also get a view of the fountains which is a plus. Hope to be back and sit on the terrace. Also the lobster mac was DELICIOUS.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Probably the best scallops I have ever eaten in my life. Great food  great service. Go to Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our first stop after arriving in Vegas  our buddy was on top of the reservations. We showed up a bit early so they had us wait at the bar until our table was ready  we had requested a patio seat to see the water show at 3 pm. As most higher end places the drinks are on the pricier side  the boys had beer and I settled on a glass of pinot noir. No sooner did the bartender whip the drinks  our table was ready and waiting on the deck. We picked a great time of year being October it was a perfect 80 degree day  and in the shaded deck really lovely sitting outside. I can only it imagine it being pretty brutal in the summer and it being say  117? Yikes! They start you with a basket of mixed breads and small bowl of olives and olive tapenade  and a pickled garlic clove (which my husband thought was roasted and popped in his mouth and crunched. Boy did his breath stink later!). We started with Beef Carpaccio and a Tuna Carpaccio (for me  the non-beef eater) that had garlic mashed potato underneath. The Tuna Carpaccio was really wonderful  would have never thought of it with mashed potato  but the flavors meshed very nicely. For lunch I ordered a flat bread with pulled BBQ chicken  peaches  and  water cress  and crumbled Gorgonzola. It's fairly large so have a good appetite  I couldn't finish it after eating the appetizer. My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with fries  and my other bud had the scallops which looked wonderful too.  And it you go around 3pm you get a water show from the fountain  pretty cool. All in all a good meal  nice atmosphere with a little entertainment to boot..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We were walking around Bellagio looking for somewhere to have dinner. We settled on Olives because we couldn't find any where else to eat and we were too hungry to keep looking. At first we were kind of put off because we knew this place would be pricy and we didn't intend on eating such a meal at the time  but I really don't regret eating here at all. Our waiter was great and pretty funny. He offered to change our white napkins for black napkins so we can ""stay sharp"". Our bread basket also came with a black napkin. The attention to detail was cute.  We ordered the Beef Carpaccio  Turkey Lasagna  and Roasted Free Range Turkey (it was Thanksgiving so they had a Turkey menu). The Beef Carpaccio was amazing. I wish I could eat it everyday. Under it was some kind of salad and a bread thing that was wonderful too. The turkey entrees were good too. I think the Turkey Lasagna had a strawberry sauce that was yummy. There was so much turkey in the lasagna!!! There was a big portion of lasagna and I couldn't finish it. :(  Overall this place had great service and the best was the Beef Carpaccio!! The turkey entrees were okay."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Phenomenal beer list  and the food is ... well what you would expect from Todd English.  Love the sliders  the wings during happy hour were good  really have never had a bad meal here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We pulled some strings and got a last minute reservation with a table on the patio.  That was a great way to start our evening.  We started with cocktails at the bar and enjoyed the English Men's Club look of the restaurant.  The tile floor and dark wood beamed ceiling are gorgeous.  Outside we ordered the Chestnut Ravioli to start.  They were delicious and crispy.  The light marinara sauce was really good and we dipped our bread in it too.  The bread basket had cheese flatbread  focaccia and yummy rolls.  They served a black olive and green olive tapenade  along with seasoned olives too.    I chose the Pan Seared Jumbo Scallops with Mushroom Risotto and Spinach Salad as my entree.  My dinner partner went with the Grilled Pork Tenderloin.  The scallops were perfection in my mouth.  The flavors were fantastic.  The mushroom risotto and spinach salads were the perfect accompaniments.  Her tenderloin was elaborate and was a large serving that she didn't make a dent in.  We enjoyed the Bellagio water show and decided to prolong the evening with dessert.  We couldn't decide because everything on the menu sounded amazing  so we went with their Bits and Bites  which had a little of everything.  Well  we should have stopped with dinner because the dessert experience wasn't as good as the dinner was.  They had 3 homemade ice creams but 2 tasted like vanilla and the 3rd wasn't good (plus  we couldn't figure out what it tasted like).  The best things on the plate were the ice cream  homemade Oreo cookie and vanilla chip cookie.  The blueberry tart wasn't bad.  The rest of the assortment wasn't good.  :(  There was what looked like a shortbread cookie but it had cayenne in it and we both had burned tongues.  The cute little strawberry cupcake was horrible and dry.  Two other cookies were also unmemorable.  Our server  Michelle  was great.  The ambience was fantastic.  The appetizer and entrees were amazing.  Olives was a great experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been there with friends and  business acquaintances dining at the patio table and it doesn't get better than Olives! Drinks are exceptional   menu is amazing. Butternut squash tortellini and ricotta ravioli are favorite. Make a reservation in advance or you will wait or be seated wherever spot is available.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had lunch here last August. The service was average  the setting was average  and the food was average. Not terrible  but I will try another place on my next LV visit. I expected something creative and well executed from Todd English  but it was very  well... average.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We skipped lunch and had a late afternoon snack here.  It was pretty tasty  service was great  prices were on the higher side.  Like most of this trip tomVegas  it was just so so.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I came here with a large group of people for a leisurely lunch  and this place just hit the spot.  I opted for the Greek Style Romaine Salad without the feta phyllo triangle  and despite being simple  it was a great meal.  The oregano vinaigrette was spot on.  We also ordered hummus for the table  and a couple dabs of that on my salad really took it up a notch.  Between that and the complimentary olives on the table  I left well fed and happy.  While I probably wouldn't ever suggest we eat here (the modified salad was one of my only options as a vegan)  I certainly wouldn't object to coming along if others wanted to go.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,my friend told us about this place and we decided to try it. we didn't make reservations and we got lucky that there was table but it was right next to the door  which was fine. our waiter was very friendly. my friend got the short ribs which was really good  i got the butter nut squash pasta which was very good but a lil too fulfilling  and my boyfriend got the steak with tempera green beans  that was soooooooooooooooo yummy. aftwards we got dessert which was some cookies and it came with a cupcake ( i love cupcakes and barly any restaurants ever serve cupcakes) it made e so happy  but the cupcake was nasty! lol! i highly reccomand this place. vegas never lets me down
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic place!!! We got seated right away  they are very polite and always keep your glasses full. Food was amazing and the server was very attentive. The only thing I disliked was how close the tables next to us were but I guess that's what you get in a restaurant in busy Las Vegas!  You can also sit outside but when it's in the 100's -who wants to? Amazing place! Would go back in a heart beat when we're in Vegas again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When I'm in Vegas with my family and we're staying at the Bellagio  we always stop by and eat here.  The coveted seating is being outside on the patio/balcony where you get an awesome view of the fountains.  Weather permitting it's a cool location to sit  they do have mist during summer months to keep it cool and then heat lamps during the winter time.   I'm sure reservations are highly recommended  which can be done via opentable.   Their menus are usually changing all the time but they have great appetizers  a wide variety of different flat breads  and then entrees from pastas to seafood to steaks.  Their house bread is amazing.  Lots of different types so you can't just stop with just 1.  Their tapenade and olives accompany it just perfectly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The Butternut Squash Tortelli is to die for.  If I could fall in love with a food  this would be it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic dinner.  Service was excellent the entire evening as well.  We ate with another couple.  The men each got the porterhouse which comes with fried lobster mac n cheese.  The ladies ordered scallops with short ribs and polenta.  This may be the only time in history I consider a scallop dish better than a porterhouse.  It's not that I don't like scallops  but I love steak.  The porterhouses were on the thin side  and had a bit of char on them.  I love a good sear  but this went beyond.  It was like one side was left on the grill a bit too long.  One nice thing in this day and age of a la carte  at Olives the entrees all come with sides.  That was a nice surprise.  The scallops were unreal.  Buttery  perfectly cooked.  And  the accompaniments were spot on.   A really good example of a dish coming together.  I was jealous  but fortunately my wife shares  so I got to enjoy quite a bit.  As I said  the service was fantastic.  As our server asked if we would like dessert  he informed us we could move to a table out on the patio and watch the fountains.  Our guests are from out of town  so the fountains of Bellagio were a huge draw for them  and one of the reasons we picked Olives.  So  very excited this was available.  I had port  but the other 3 shared a warm cookie dessert with ice cream.  I had a couple bites  the cookies were of excellent quality.  It was an excellent end to a great evening.  Recommended  and order an order of scallops for the table  even if no one gets them.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Visited Olives with the Hubs the night we landed in Vegas for a conference. I had made reservations online  specifically requesting a table out on the patio overlooking ""lake"" Bellagio  and when we arrived  a table hadn't cleared yet. We didn't mind  and took two seats at the bar. There  I enjoyed the most delicious lemon-flavored cocktail  complete with sugar-rimmed martini glass & all!   Soon  our table was ready & I have to say that we got a fantastic table  the perfect spot for me & the Hubs  right on the lake's railing... perfection. At least for Las Vegas :-)  We ordered another round of drinks and awaited the arrival of our entrees. The bread & olive tapanade served while we waited was nice  but nothing to go crazy for. I ordered a special of the evening - shrimp & pasta. Unfortunately  the shrimp looked a bit like fishing bait and I located a number of small shells throughout the dish  but the overall fresh  creamy lemon flavor was good - I wouldn't order it again. The hubs ordered a fish special of the evening  along with some asparagus  which he raved about.   We opted for a third round of drinks and some fountain-gazing after our meal  since we weren't ""feeling"" the desserts at Olives.  Overall the experience was lovely  drinks were killer  albeit a bit on the pricey side (it is Vegas  after all) and our table out on the patio was to die for. A great Vegas experience  not necessarily a great Vegas meal."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nothing super exciting. To start we ordered the Pina colada martini that was on special but the consistency was way too thick. More like desert than a drink  would not recommend. For food we had the mushroom flatbread  tempura green beans  and shared the salmon entree. The salmon was great....everything else forgettable.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,one of my favorite restaurants EVER.    quality: **** everything was cooked perfectly.  the only dish that i've ever had there that was disappointing was their lamb appetizer.  Their Foie Gras appetizer was delicious!  It was honestly better than the foie that I got from Picasso (in the Bellagio) Hands down best Foie.  Best fig and prosciutto flat bread EVER  quantity: **** HUGE portions.  Becareful of what you order   Price: **** Amazing price for the quality  portion size   ambiance and service. One of THE best deals / restaurants on the strip. we can usually get an appetizer and two entrees for under $100  Things I've tried: Prosciutto and fig flat bread **** lamb appetizer** Foie Gras appetizer **** scallops *** (great but not out of this world good) salmon***(same as above)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Most memorable meal of my life. Crab stuffed trout  flat bread  dirty martinis (a couple too many of those)  and numerous other top notch dishes. I admit I was only there once a couple of years ago  but I've never forgotten it and would be truly heartbroken if it really is not as good as it once was.  Far superior to Fish Club  Todd English's lesser attempt in Seattle.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food is still incredible!  We decided to order other things from the menu than what we usually order.  Had Tuna tartare and it was fresh and delicious!  The Sea Scallops were delicate and tasty!  My husband had the Ricotta Ravioli and it looked so good that I had to take one.  It was incredible!!!  The tomato sauce that covered the Ravioli was incredible!  Not acidic at all.  Washed the food down with Santa Margarita Pinot Griggio.  We were so full that we couldn't have dessert this time.  Our waiter  John S. was very attentive and pleasant.  Looking forward to coming back next month!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've been wanting to try this place out for years and I finally got a chance to try it out. I had the burger with truffles and it was probably the best burger I've ever had. It was juicy and had a great flavor on top of the earthiness of the truffles. They also give you a trio of tapenades that were very good. I can't wait to back and try other items on the menu. Oh I forgot to mention that it has amazing view of the Bellagio fountains!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beautiful view of the Bellagio fountain. The food and drinks here were really good. I ordered the Ravioli dish and my boyfriend got the Atlantic salmon dish. The Ravioli dish came with sausage and the tomato sauce which was really delicious. My boyfriends Salmon dish was very fresh. The drinks are pretty strong. We usually go to Yellowtail near Olives but I'm glad we tried this restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food is actually pretty good  as far as flavoring is concerned... but they're always so crowded (due to their location) they hardly pay proper attention to cook times. So it's a tossup... you can either get your meal done perfectly  or so overcooked  it's totally tasteless... unacceptable for a supposedly good restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I came here Memorial Day weekend on a trip to Vegas with my girlfriends. First of all  we called the day of  to push back our Saturday night reservation a few hours  and they were accommodating. However we showed up about 40 minutes late anyways and didn't expect to still be able to get a table since they were booked solid. The hostess said she would do her best to get us a table or we could eat at the bar. We waited about 30 min and she was able to seat us at a table. We felt very lucky and were appreciative of her efforts.  We each ordered cocktails and each one was wonderful. They give you an ipad with the drink menu  which is a fun and useful incorporation of technology. I had a ginger one  which had a marvelous rich ginger flavor. It was the favorite among the group. I order a lot of ginger-y cocktails and this is the best one yet!   For an appetizer my friends and I shared the beef carpaccio. I have never ordered this dish before  but it was outstanding. My foodie friend informed me that the beef was the perfect quality and it was likely the best she had. It cost about $20 and it was worth it. Great for sharing!  I ordered the scallops for my main course. They were buttery and delicious on a bed of perfectly creamy mashed potatoes. Possibly the best I have had and worth the price of $42. My friends ordered the prime beef tenderloin which came with a crab cake ($52) and the mushroom pappardelle ($32). The tenderloin and crab cake were very tasty  but we spent some time debating whether it was worth the high price. Neither the beef nor the crab cake were particularly special or prepared in a difficult way  although they were definitely better than average. The crab cake was my favorite part  probably because I love crab. Additionally  the pappardelle was good  but also not outstanding.   We were too full to order dessert.  The service and ambience of the restaurant was lovely. Not so dark you can't read or see each other  but dark enough to have a relaxing  romantic atmosphere. They serve three types of bread (chocolate walnut  foccacia  and a cheese crisp) with olives and olive tapenade. We enjoyed quite a bit of these. When our meal was winding down  the man who served our bread/bused our table informed us to keep an eye out for interesting people. He would not tell us who. We hoped to spot some celebrity entering the restaurant after this comment  but were unsuccessful.   Overall  I really enjoyed the food and service at Olives. I give it three stars instead of four because some of the dishes did not exceed our expectations as we had hoped  but many did. If my family or friends were to visit Vegas  I would recommend this restaurant to them.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came for a quick bite after winning big on craps. I wanted a quick meal so I could go back to play and was seated quickly. Ordered a basic Caesar salad which was very good. Vibe great and service good
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hubby and I did the tasting menu. The moules frites were a little different from the more traditional version but had good flavor. Quite a few of the mussels were not open after cooking though. I had the salmon as my entree. Overall a good dish but a little too much on my plate and I hate to waste meat/seafood. Finished off the meal with the Oreo bread pudding. Very good with the vanilla butter cream icing. Cocktails were a little on the weak side. Good view of the Bellagio fountains. Overall good service with decent timing between courses.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to Olives to celebrate my birthday. Everything starting from the view from the balcony seats to the service was phenomenal. Paul Anthony  our server was soo amazing. He made our experience so much more pleasant when he gave us the seats we realllly wanted. He was so helpful when we were trying to order a certain dish and wanted advice  he was funny  and very attentive. The food was great  the drinks were great  and our experience overall was great all thanks to Paul. Oh and the surprise he brought was was super nice too! Would definitely recommend this restaurant for those who are in town.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,thanks for baring with my annoying request! it's just so beautiful outside that day I wanted to sit outside enjoy the fountain view  but we try to find a table that wasn't super windy so we switched table twice and went to sit inside instead  the waiters were super nice about it.  my friends got the lunch special shrimp scampi and I got the salmon .. it looks really amazing! my salmon was perfectly cooked  I had a great experience there.   food portion 5/5 (you'll definitely be full after your entree and breads)  ambiance 4/5 indoor (a bit dark) 5/5 outdoor (amazing view)  food taste 5/5 (I only tried shrimp scampi and salmon if was perfectly prepared)   service 5/5 (professional  friendly  attentive)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was very good.  I got the ravioli and had the carpaccio for an appetizer (it's huge and really good!). Service was good.   The prices to me were kind of high...but it's Vegas.  (My vodka martini was $15.)  I would go back just for the carpaccio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great location  we were lucky to have nice fountain views even from our indoor table. Service was five stars; attentive but not fussy.  But the food - everything too heavily salted (and I LOVE salt)  sauced  and dressed. The gnocchi was like raw dough  the pappardelle overlooked to where just lifting the fork would break the noodles  also heavily sauced. Tuns tartare was an enormous portion  which was a pleasant surprise  but then turned out to extremely bland  unlike the rest of the dishes. I didn't want to bother eating more than a few bites because it just didn't bring anything to the party. Also had an overdressed salad. Great breads were served with olive tapenade  which
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place has potential. Their menu has changed since my last visit and I can't recall exactly what I had however  it was dry. I want to say it was pork and it came with mac n cheese which was divine. My advice based on my one experience would be to improve on the consistency in quality of the preparation. Another visit might be in order.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you're lost and alone Or you're sinking like a stone  carry on! May your past be the sound Of your feet upon the ground  carry on at Todd English's Olives! - Fun (carry on)  With Michael Mina and Sensi closed for the holidays at the Bellagio  I turned my attention to Todd English's Olives! (mainly because of his name and how many restaurants he's opened) You will notice right away how dimly lit the place is in general. Since it was December  I thoroughly appreciated they were playing Christmas music in the background and the fountain view from our table.  The foie gras starter we had was an interesting experience for me. I love foie gras but I don't remember eating it on its own. They made it as an appetizer with brioche  pears  yogurt  and walnuts. When combined with all the components  it works really nicely. However if you eat the foie gras alone  it feel's very fattening and I think only the hardcore foie gras lovers would appreciate it since there's alot of fat essence to it.   The sea scallops that I ordered was very fun to eat. They put it in a rectangular plate and I just ate it from left to right with the truffle mashed potatoes and cabernet sauce. There was some odd green on it (don't know if it was used more as a garnish) but I just moved it aside and finished everything else haha  Last random personal side note:  I'm used to wearing dress shirts on a daily basis but there's this feeling that I get from this restaurant that the dress code is on the more formal side. It's not dress code enforced or anything and I normally don't even notice these things  but that's the overall feel that I got from Olives. I don't generally like that everyone has to be up to a certain dress code here just so they don't feel out of their element. Obviously its Vegas so most people dress to impress anyways  but that's not always the case and it shouldn't be. Again  this is not a reflection of the restaurant itself  this was my own personal observation while dining here. Enjoy the fine food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very ordinary food. excellent service.   I ate there earlier this week and have no specific recall of the food--that is not good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,there aren't many mid-priced restaurants in vegas.  it's either celebrity chef 4 $$$$ restaurants  chains  buffets  or you have to drive off the strip for more reasonably priced food.  thus i think Olives is a pleasant compromise.  some dishes in the $20 range  and good flavors.  notably  the bread basket was delicious -- currant  cheese crisp  etc. yum the butternut squash tortelli was quite sweet  thus hard to make it as a single entree.  the shrimp scampi risotto side was decadent and buttery.  brick oven roasted free range chicken decent.  entrees large  and if you're lucky  you'll be seated by the window for a view of the fountain show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This has to be one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I went here with my Ex and his family back in May of '09. We were seated on the patio facing the water fountains. I started off with a Lychee Martini! Oh was it strong. Just the way I like it. I had the Halibut on a bed of mash potatoes. The fish was perfect! Moist and juicy inside and it was perfectly seared on the outside. The mash potatoes were a bit salty for my taste but it was good. For dessert we hard the gelato. Great company  great service and great view!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,High end dinning with a view of the fountains  Spectacular!!!! Very attentive waitstaff. Food was the way I remember when visiting Italy. Wine selection for all distinctive tastes.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a group of 8 for lunch.  Got seated by the windows where you can watch the fountains.  Great food  drinks and service.  Had some sort of bourbon special drink.  Awesome.  Started to drag so the waiter suggested an espresso martini cocktail.  Wasn't sure about it but it was delicious.    Shared the tuna carpaccio and burger with truffle cheese.  Both were plentiful and really good.  So glad I shared because I never would have been able to finish.  Great place and I'd go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our waiter Paul A was the best waiter I've ever had. Not only was he fluent in the menu and made fantastic suggestions  he was funny and charismatic. He went out of his way on several occasions to make our experience unique and memorable. The restaurant was great but Paul A was superb. Looking forward to coming back in the future.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We visited for the 2nd time in 7 months.  The Cioppino Blanco was excellent.   We brought in a bottle of Villenueve Chateaunuff du Pape  it was perfect for our occasion.  Blazing fountains and perfect food and wine to pair  life is great!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Disappointment. Went twice for lunch.   First time: Caprese salad (off menu) we saw another table order was small but delicious. Entrees took forever and came to the table cold. They made ""new"" ones too quickly to actually recook. Tortelli was ok. Short Rib Ragu over orzo didn't match what I make at home. Waitress was distracted. Overall experience was below mediocre  Second time: carpaccio over greens over cornbread---yuck. Overly worked. Beef delicious. Greens ok. Cornbread mushy and gross. Pass."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really wanted to like this place. I heard so much about it. I also went there for the view of the fountain of course (that part was great). But the food man... my goodness the food! I expected so much more. More flavors and creativeness. It did not impress me at all.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The experience was not perfect  but the good parts were so mother freakin' good that it toned down the not so great parts.  My sister and I  with our spouses  came to dinner here to celebrate our mom's 85th birthday with our ""almost dad"". (step dad who is really our dad now.)  The restaurant is pretty and overlooks the Bellagio fountains - awesome!  Waitstaff were very nice.    The cocktail special was sublime.  I wish I had ordered it - fruit juices with vanilla infused vodka.  Heaven. Truly.    They brought us white chocolate and walnut foccacia with walnuts  flat bread and some other delicious homemade buttery bread with bowls of mixed olives and two kinds of olive tapanade.   This sent my husband and I directly to the moon  do not pass go  do not collect $200.   He had to bring the manager over to tell her that this  so far  was the best meal he had ever had in Vegas - and we were only on cocktails and bread.    Once actual eating commenced  things were a bit spottier.  For salads  we all stuck with Ceasar salads.  Pretty good  but WAY too pricey.  No simple green salad should be $17  especially when you have to leave the restaurant and cross the casino plaza to use a public bathroom.  Totally kills whatever elegance you were going for when there is a changing table and public bathroom stuff around you and you are tottering around on your best  most elegant heels  trying hard to be cool.   Pasta and appetizers included:  Unbelievable little bay scallops in a whiskey cream sauce.   So so so so so so good.  But rich.  Super rich.  Fried prawns - excellent!!   Osso Busso pasta - ummmm.   Savory and meaty and rich.  Pasta was fresh and perfect.  Butternut squash Tortelli - beautiful flavor of fresh sweet squash in perfect pasta.  Sauce was a mite sweet  but perfect as a shared first course.   Goat cheese balls - good  but not nearly as successful. It was really a shrimp dish.  Lots of shrimp  few pasta balls filled with goat cheese.  Disappointing.  For a $38 pasta course  it should have been a --- well  a pasta course.  Honestly  I would have taken most of the shrimp out of it  doubled the pasta and cut the price in half.    Main courses - Best was the scallops.  Perfectly cooked on rounds of english pea polenta with swirls of beets.  Beautiful and delicious.  If you like scallops  you should look no further.    Someone ordered the pork chop.  He  actually a picky eater  devoured it instantly and practically licked the plate.  He proclaimed it wonderful and I believe him.  I was the only loser.  I had the striped bass.  The fish tasted funny and it was overcooked.   The funny taste might have been simply the true taste of the fish and I suspect it was no fault of the cook.  But it tasted foul.  I also really hate overcooked fish.  I understand they were really trying to get that skin crispy  and it was.  So - my dinner was really fish skin and broccollini.   Oh  there was a rather ho-hum risotto under the fish.  It was kind of good  but only ok.   Luckily  I was so stuffed from eating from everyone else's plate  it really did not matter at all.    All in all  it was a wonderful experience and I heartily recommend visiting.  (Just don't order the striped bass)."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant was a pleasant surprise. The food was delicious   the service excellent and the ambiance very nice.  We sat on the patio and enjoyed the fresh air.  Everything was flavored perfectly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice location right on the Bellagio fountains. If it's nice out its worth the wait for a balcony table.  Prices are moderate  considering its in the Bellagio.  We had the chicken margarita sandwich with sweet potato fries  the chicken was a tad dry and the fries just ok.  We also had a Tuscan flat bread that was good and had plenty of toppings.  For the view alone this place is worth checking out.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overall I enjoyed my meal a lot.  The food  while very pricey  was delicious though had a few execution issues.  For example  my otherwise excellent beef tartare had two separate beds of mashed potatoes that really didn't make sense.  The striped bass that I had from the specials menu was delicious.  I loved the flavor of the butternut squash tortelli but I thought that the plating wasn't very attractive.  Portions were just the right size  but with most entrees hovering around $50  this is not a cheap night out.  Service was excellent.  A note to fellow diners - please keep your voices at a reasonable level and control your children.  With tile floors and high ceilings  Olives can get pretty loud.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is just ok  not as good as we expected  but the views are fantastic!  2 stars for the food  4 for the view and 5 for the service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My husband & I choose this place for one of our dinners while on a weekend trip to Las Vegas to celebrate our anniversary. Made our reservations in advance via Yelp. Honestly  it was mostly for the terrace view of the fountains. I'd been here years ago with my sister for a birthday for lunch & had recalled the view. We were not disappointed  we got a great table.  So for the view I would have given the restaurant 5 stars  but...  We shared the grilled squid & octopus appetizer which was tasty & the seafood was cooked very well  but it consisted mostly of chickpeas! Almost should have called it a chickpea appetizer.   For our main dishes we shared a fiery sausage flat bread & sea scallops.  The flat bread pizza  although good  was not what we expected from the ""fiery"" description. Sausage was quite bland  but carmelized onions & herbed cheese was good. Now the scallops were delicious!  They were cooked perfectly & very yummy. So overall I'd have given Olive's for the view & the food 4 stars  but..  Servers were all very nice  but we did seem to have an issue with getting our main entrees.  I know this is a kitchen issue & not our waitresses fault.  People all around us were served & were eating yet we weren't until my husband asked about our meal.  Since we didn't order anything that seemed extremely complex  why did it take longer?  So taking view  food & service into consideration  I could only come up with 3 stars for the whole experience.   We'd still go again  though!  Those fountains are pretty cool!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Disappointed that a request for outside seating was basically ignored. Celebrating a special anniversary and asked about outside seating to view the fountain show and was told there was a 2 hour wait. Opted to eat inside only to see three unoccupied tables outside the entire time we dined inside. Hostess / waitstaff seemed uninterested. Food mediocre.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Gotta be honest. It was good  but I wouldn't make. It a must visit on our next trip.  Overall the restaurant had a off putting smell of olives (especially if you don't like them). We ordered the beef carpaccio and fig and prosciutto flatbread.  The flatbread was okay but nothing noteworthy. The carpaccio was also okay  but lacked any major flavor notes considering all of the ingredients. It desperately needed some acid or spice to brighten it up.   Again  not bad  just wouldn't make it a must visit for the price. There are far better out there (See: Julian Serrano Tapas)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I ran into this restaurant on accident. I was skeptical to try it out considering how much I hate olives but I must say the food was amazing. Very tasteful!   The Bloody Mary was to die for. I also got to see  glimpse of the bellagio water show!   I will be coming back  for sure!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,1 star for finding pointy plastic in food. Twice  Ok so let me start by saying this is a painful review for me to write. Literally and figuratively!  I recently dined at Olives twice out of the three days I was in Vegas.   The first time was great  so great in fact we went back the last day we had there.   The first visit we ordered the Beef Carpaccio  which is absolutely crave worthy and delicious!  We also ordered the salmon and portobello flatbreads. They were all delicious. We sat outside to have a good view of the water ballet. It was the perfect ambiance. So much so that we decided to return two days later.   So on to the plastic in food day.  We again were outside and having a great time. We ordered the carpaccio and tuna tartar to start. They were both great. As we were on our second bottle of wine we decided to order the delicious salmon flatbread.   I had placed my first piece into my plate. About 3 bites in I felt myself bite into something very hard. It poked the back of my cheek and really hurt. I got it out of my mouth nervous I had cracked a tooth. Well it wasn't a cracked tooth but a cracked piece of plastic almost in the shape of a triangle. So gross and disturbing. We alerted our server. My mom continued to eat her piece as she was still so hungry. My sister then say something sticking out of another piece and pulled it out. This time it was another piece but rectangular shaped. I was mortified. So embarrassed for Olives. I found it to be such an unfortunate situation for such a great restaurant.   I didn't want my Olives love to be ruined by this. Unfortunately  it is definitely tainted. I'm beyond shocked they only chose to take off the flatbread as well as give 1 free dessert for my sister and mom to share  as I was obviously done eating. I mean honestly they should have taken care of the whole meal.   I'm not a person trying to get something for free so we paid our bill without making a big production about it. Our waiter asked if I wanted to make an incident report and I declined due to not chipping a tooth. I did have a puncture in my cheek  but again I didn't want to make it a big production.  The server said he had spoken to the chef and it looked like a piece of the plastic they store the salmon in. Ugh so gross!    How cheap of them to only comp the plastic filled salmon and 1 dessert. I was embarrassed for them by that offer. I am disappointed by their handling of the situation and will share what happened to me with all of my friends and family that stay at the Bellagio regularly. Everyone has been shocked they didn't do a little more.  Maybe if they had I might not have left with not only a puncture in my mouth but a bad taste too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food ! The olive dip and breads that start the meal are great for wetting the appetite  I had the mushroom pasta and my friend the salmon. The mushroom pasta was creamy and had a little spicy kick to it. The salmon was cooked to a perfect tenderness.   Some seats have a view of the Bellagio fountains.  Our waitress was engaged and helpful and fun. The manager checked up on us at the end of the meal.  Dress can be casual to dressy.  Two drinks  one salad  two entrees and tip ran $130 for two people.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We weren't disappointed in Olives  just not overly excited.  Service was fine.  Not bad not amazing.  Food  was the same.  I had the pesto gnocchi and my husband had the lobster risotta or something like that.  I wouldn't eat here again  but it wasn't horrible.  We have had much better food and service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We just made our second trip to this restaurant this past weekend.  We went with my in-laws who are used to eating/living well who had never been to this restaurant.   We got a table just inside by the windows with a nice view of the fountain show.    We had excellent  attentive service.   The bread/tapenade was as good as we remembered.  We ordered the tomato/basil/cheese flatbread as an appetizer and it was wonderful.   Between the four of us we had the following meals:  1.  Pork Tenderloin special:  Fantastic!  Great flavor 2.  Fish & Chips special:  My father in law was very pleased 3.  Cajun Ciabbata w/fries:  Fries were great but meat in sandwich was fatty. 4.  Olives Burger w/fries:  Fries tasted fishy  burger was okay.  So we all loved the appetizers but were partially satisfied with lunch entrees.  All of this plus tip was $140.00.  We would go back but stick to the olive tapenade and flatbreads for lunch.  Reservations are accepted.  We went at noon on a Saturday and got in without a problem.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great meal!  Try to make a reservation for a table outside or by a window with a view.  The restaurant is perfectly situated for views of the fountain show  which was so nice to watch during dinner.  I didn't ask for a table outside when I made my reservation and one wasn't available for at least an hour and a half from our reservation time.  They did offer us a table by the window  which was 2nd best.  We had a great view!  The breads served to the table w/ the olive tapenades were delicious!  My husband got oysters to start and I got the crab cake.  For dinner  my husband got the shrimp tagliatelle pasta and I got the braised short rib.  It was all so  so good!  Nothing really spoke to us from the dessert menu  so we skipped dessert.  Our cocktails were also right on - tried the Manhattan martini and the bellini.  I definitely recommend this restaurant!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was delicious...Before the meal  they brought out chocolate bread  which was awesome...The ceaser salad was very blah  but the scallops with mushroom risotto was great.  The crem brulee had cheyenne pepper in it (which it didn't mention on the menu)  but if you love spicy unique desserts  like I do  you'd love it! The service sucked.  Our entrees all arrived at different times and our server had about as much personality as a corpse.  I'd come here again but I was sad that the overall dining experience wasn't as fantastic as I had hoped...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great place to eat.  The Bellagio pool side table was great to watch the fountains strut their stuff.  The food was excellent and the staff were friendly and very very good at their jobs.  Our waiter Paul was great!  When I hesitated at ordering the salmon because of the beet risotto (yuck! beets...)  he suggested mushrooms as a substitute which I greatly appreciated.  He took pictures of myself and my friends while the fountain show was going on and was genuinely attentive to our needs.  If you get a chance  ask for Paul
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just a quick note to let other families know that the staff at Olives were amazing with my 1 year old nephew and 3 year old niece. Considering it's a nice  adult restaurant  they couldn't have been sweeter or more accommodating at 7pm on a Saturday night. They didn't have a specific children's menu  but they let us order half portions of the pasta dishes and gladly filled up sippy cups and baby bottles.   Overall a great experience if you're looking for a nice place to take little ones  as a lot of the restaurants at our hotel (Aria) wouldn't even accept children at all.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here looking for a famous creme brulee we had tried at Todd English's restaurant in DC many years ago  but unfortunately it was no longer on the menu. We decided to stay based on the attractive location and pleasant hosts.   The location is indeed spectacular. In between shopping the opulent halls of the Bellagio  Olives offers a dark  intimate atmosphere and an inviting menu. Loved the huge crystal chandeliers and the waitstaff was incredibly helpful. The fountain show as a backdrop really does make for a sight.  We ordered the Roasted Maine Lobster Carbonara and Mahi Mahi  along with some stiff drinks and a bottle of red. The carbonara was perfectly done. A touch al-dente served with bits of lobster topped by a split half tail. Hard to beat this presentation. The basil creme sauce was a tad spicy even  very good. The fish was excellently prepared as well. Bathed in a miso butter sauce  and served with rice the fish was very tender. The leeks  though  were a tad undercooked. Overall the meal was four-stars.  You can get out without paying $100 but why try? The menu is too inviting not to give some of the delicious entrees a try. Sit on the patio if you can or by a window.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good! Nothing too far out there  I had scallop dish and couldn't even finish it all  between appetizers and the rich food  I was satiated!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas! Everything from the olive tapenades they serve with the bread to the cocktails to the ambiance is superb. The view of the fountains in unbeatable. The beef carpaccio app is incredible. Best beef carpaccio ever...nothing compares  and I normally don't eat red meat. I make an exception for this dish. So good that once we got it as our app and entree! Love Olives! Only downside is it is always packed  so make a reservation!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this restaurant. Every time i go to vegas i make sure to eat here. Yummy food nice service and great location. Its a hoot to sit outside by the fountains and enjoy all that vegas is. The salads are fantastic and love the proseco! Make reservations as soon as you have your dates planned for your visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Seriously amazing. Four of us showed up with no reservation on a Friday and opted to sit at the bar Great Service by Zack. Service10/10. Food 9.5/10
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food at Olives is not as good as you'd expect for the price tag  but it receives 3 stars from me for the extras.  First  the bread basket is totally yummy. There's a variety of breads to keep you happy while you wait for your meal  and each one was good. Second  the atmosphere is quite nice. It's upscale-ish without falling all over itself. Third  we were given a stellar table for a reservation made 2 hours in advance  for 12 people  on a busy Saturday night.  The food is oversalted and under-tasty. We were all happy enough with our meals  as it tasted good  but nothing about it made us feel like food is the focus at Olives. I think they are banking on the location inside Bellagio and the atmosphere to be the draw  and serving good-but-not-great food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had our anniversary dinner here about a month ago and the food was okay. I had an amazing pasta dish  but unfortunately my husband's steak was charred on the outside and still bleeding on the inside...he ordered medium-rare. The drinks were great and the olive/bread basket was good.  I called about four weeks in advance letting them know it was for our anniversary and wanted a table on the patio  but was disappointed to find out that you need to stop by the restaurant a few hours ahead of your reservation time to be seated on the patio.  That would have been good to know! The main reason we went here was for the patio seating....dissapointing.  They did get us a table next to the window with a decent view of the fountains  and our server was nice.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I met a friend here for lunch on Monday and had a nice experience.  Much of the menu is quite heavy for lunch  but we ended up deciding to split the salmon entree and the truffle fries to control our portions.  The truffle fries were perfect...not overwhelming or too rich in flavor.  The salmon was great too with a cognac beurre blanc sauce served with asparagus and wild rice.  The restaurant is nicely designed with beautiful views of Lake Bellagio and the fountain show and the service is top notch too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"What an incredible dining experience from start to finish! It was the perfect Vegas dinner for my sister and I  who dreamed of having a view of the Bellagio fountain shows while we ate. Well  we got THE BEST view.  I made a reservation for 6 on a Thursday night  thinking that might be early enough to score a seat on the patio. We showed up and asked about it  and the hostess told us we could come back in 45 mins and they would try. Cool  it was pretty early for dinner anyway and we wanted to see the conservatory and lobby exhibits  so we did that and came back as requested.   We were immediately seated at the best table on the patio  front and center along the lake. The sun had just set and other diners quickly filled in the spaces around us. Several people asked us how we scored that table. We felt so fancy!  Our server  Paul  was the best. He was charming and friendly and insisted on taking several photos of us throughout the dinner. We got some great shots to capture this wonderful memory together. We had appetizers  entrees  cocktails  and dessert  so we stayed about an hour and a half - during which we saw 8 or 9 different fountain shows. Amazing!  Oh  I suppose you want to hear about the FOOD? Hmm  ok. It was spectacular  too. I was actually surprised at the level of quality everything was  AND reasonably priced. Our tab was under $100! We loved everything: - Bread & olives starter (free) - Two huge cocktails - Brick oven roasted chicken entree - Fig & prosciutto flatbread (also huge  about 8"" x 12"") - Molten chocolate cake - Dessert coffee cocktail  We were treated like royalty by everyone  including the manager who stopped by all the tables to check in. We would have been happy to pay twice as much because it was basically dinner and a show. I will always dine here when in Vegas!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I feel that most people come here for flatbreads and drinks. With that said  I feel that maybe I just ordered the wrong things and still want to give this place another chance. Service was great  atmosphere was fun and lively  feels like a place to  have casual business meetings lol And the view of the Bellagio fountains was beautiful. The beef tartare  was alright  good flavor but nothing impressive (sage is where it's at! Lol). I had the spit roasted pork chop and I was pretty disappointed. The flavor tasted very basic and was actually pretty tough and chewy. I can make a better pork chop at home. My boyfriend had the grilled sirloin and he said it wasn't anything special either. After being disappointed  we didn't try to order dessert. We went to the bacchanal buffet at Caesar's earlier that day and actually preferred that! I want to come back and try some of  the flatbreads  beef carpaccio  seafood and desserts or just from  a prix fixe menu and hopefully will have a better experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I do love Todd English and I have a couple of his cookbooks.  We were strolling around Vegas on a Saturday just before noon looking for a good place for brunch.  I THINK I have been to an Olive's many years ago in Massachusetts. We arrived about 11:50am and they said they had a 20 min wait for an outside table. So we went to the bar for a cocktail and an appetizer of Beef carpaccio. (that was the best food item we ordered) It was on top of a risotto cake. I also really like the olive paste they serve with the bread basket.  Sure enough - about 20 minutes later we got an amazing table in the small outside patio with another stellar view of the Bellagio fountains (we had been to the Paris restaurant the night before)  and the music is on speakers right there - so very fun.  (I think we say 3 sessions of the fountain during lunch  1 song each)  We split a flatbread of the day (buffalo chicken - which wasn't very buffalo-y and not great) and split a bibb lettuce salad that was supposed to have blue cheese in it - but I didn't see or taste any. The service and the view were fantastic - we were not hurried (even though we ordered only 2 small plates for 3 people)  the food ...Meh...  Sure enough as we were leaving the place inside was about 65% full  so we go there at just the right time. Warning - they do allow smoking on the patio and there were two guys at the next table smoking when we got there - but they left soon after...but I can see how you could get stuck next some heavy smokers - which would have made me want to eat inside. That would have been a shame on a perfect day with a perfect view.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The mister and I had our first meal here upon our arrival for Vegas on Thanksgiving day. We were here in between meals of lunch and dinner at 3pm. We waited for five minutes on line before the hostess sat us down. Why we choose Olives is because the lines for the Bellagio Buffet and Cafe Bellagio were so damn long! Who wants to wait so long like you are waiting in line at Disney?! The mister and I were so starving after our flight. Olives seemed the only choice as we've been to this restaurant five years for lunch and I remember it being outstanding.     Well  not quite outstanding this time  but nontheless very good. At 3pm  only the bar menu was being served. We ordered fried calamari  caesar salad  and the flat bread with mushrooms. The mister treated himself to a pear martini. The food and the martini was very delish. Calamari is a huge portion. Todd's version of a caesar salad is quite different as he put his own spin with lots of sliced large tomatoes and make their own croutons  bite size pieces of bread. The flat bread was the highlight of our meal and had that MMMmmm factor.    The waiter was very attentive and gave a good recommend for pear martini  but the food coming out of the kitchen was very slow. Olives has one of the best views for the fountain show. Go out to the outdoor area to see it. Another view that I had was all the waiters sitting down at the back table waiting for their dinner shift to start. For bar food  we spent quite alot of $$  but hey it was our Thanksgiving meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had reservations for Saturday at 9pm. Super busy time for the restaurant. I felt like the tables were too crammed together. My sisters had complained that the workers kept on bumping into their chairs everytime they passed by. The food was overall just ok. The beef carpaccio  was good and the gnocchi and braised beef  were gpod. Optopus ap  was chewy with very little flavor. I have been wanting to go here for a while now  sadly it let me down.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was fantastic! They were warm  friendly and attentive.   We had warm bread with olive tapenades (green and black)  olives and a cheesy (with hint of spice) toasted flatbread to start. We sampled truffle fries while we waited for our food (plus our son loves fries). They came out quickly and were easy to devour.  I had the scallops with risotto and spinach. They literally melted in my mouth. The risotto was cheesy perfection and the garlicky spinach brought it all together. I would HIGHLY recommend this dish (the portion size was slightly small if you have a big appetite). My husband had the chicken with fingerling potatoes and broccolini. It was light and flavorful.  I was a bit surprised by the prices for lunch - hence the 4 star rating. However  the service  quality of food and ambiance made it all worth it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First rate! Food  drinks and cocktails are amazing! Jon is easy on the eyes!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good food  good service  but a little overpriced. It's a star or two away from fine dining. They push really hard on the wine  the appetizers  the dessert.   If you want a table with a view of the water show  make sure you ask for it in your reservation. Like a dork  I thought all the tables would be able to see the watershow and we got put behind a wall.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Customer Service: 4/5  Good customer service by our waiter.  We were able to be seated by a window seat and could see the fountains from our seat.  -1 star because one of the busboys almost knocked one of our plates off when he was power walking by our table.  Besides that  it is good customer service that is expected at this price range.  Food: 4.5/5  The pork chops were great!  The fig/prosciutto flatbread was good  but probably better with a lightly spread fig jam (too much fig).  The lobster pasta was good too  but nothing super special.  I was most impressed by the cocktails.  Very interesting and tasty cocktails worth a try!  Cost: If I remember correctly ~$200+ with 2 appetizers/2 entrees and a couple rounds of cocktails.  Total 4/5  The view is great!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We ate at this restaurant on 12/29. There were six of us  had reservations at 5:30  so far  so good. The waiter came to the table and was just not professional. It was like he thought we were friends. Salads and soups came and went  still good. When the entrees came out  they brought them three at a time 5 minutes apart. I had the short rib with potatoes and brussel sprouts. The sprouts were cold  the short rib and potatoes were warm. I asked if anyone else's food was cold or warm  and the answer was a resounding yes by someone who had the chicken. We called it to the waiters attention. He apologized quickly and took it back to ""take care of it"". The food came back 10 minutes later with a plate that was so hot it was ridiculous  but the food was still warm on both of the returned entrees. I elected not to make a big deal out of it and ate what I could. Another of our diners did point it out to him unbeknownst to me  and he tried to ""make it right with 2 complimentary desserts. At the prices they charge for these meals  this is just unacceptable. I am writing this to partially vent and to warn future diners to beware."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great view of the Bellagio fountain show!   I went for lunch and luckily seated in the patio area with the view of the fountain.  It was absolutely beautiful.  As other reviewers mentioned  the bread basket with olive tapenade was good.  We had the mushroom flatbread and the fish dish (special of the day).  They were both good  but not greatly memorable.  I definitely recommend Olives for its overall great atmosphere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Friendly waiters and knowledgeable sommelier. We dined at this restaurant before going to see the ""Jersey Boys"" at the Paris. Our waiter  Ralph was very helpful and got our food order out in a timely manner. He timed  the drinks  salads and pastas so that we didn't feel rushed. After dinner  he even walked with us out of the restaurant to show us which direction to get to the Paris hotel.  My friends and I ordered the Grilled Squid and Octopus with Chickpeas. Generous morsels of squid and octopus in a tomato based sauce. The chickpeas were firm but not crunchy and provided a nice contrast to the tender squid and octopus.  The baby Lolla Rosa was a salad mixed with red onions  beets  tangerines and wild flower honeycomb  which I found out was a smear of honey.   We also ordered the Chicken and Gnocchi and Short Rib Pappardelle. The pasta and gnocchi were freshly made and both dishes were excellent.  Since this restaurant doesn't take reservations  my suggestion is go early and ask to be seated outside or near the window. The Bellagio fountains put on quite a show and it was nice to watch."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Review is for Spring Restaurant Week 2012 menu:  This was an extremely enjoyable meal.  I got here early enough I could sit on their patio overlooking the Fountains of Bellagio.  They had 8 LP heaters cranking out the warmth and it was great.  Nothing says success like location  location  location.  On with the meal.  You get a nice basket of bread and lavash and a three section dish with olive tapenade and olives.  One section has green olive tapenade  the middle has a small olive assortment  and the last section has a ripe olive tapenade.  The tapenade with the bread and the lavash is almost addictive.  Ask your server and you'll get the recipe they use for making the tapenade.   Course 1:  I ordered the crispy lamb lollipops with sweet corn raita  Calvados demi-glaze  Za'atar carrots  and Greek yogurt.  The description comes from their Restaurant Week menu.  It was very good  but it was poorly named.  I expected some kind of different use of lamb to create a lollipop.  Instead  they were lamb ribs.  They were tasty with a nice crispness  but it wasn't what I was expecting.  The corn was an excellent accompaniment.  Course 2:  I got the Airline chicken breast on a bed of lobster mac and cheese with broccoli florets and ""Truffle Fondue  Buttered Broccoli Florets  Marsala Jus  Toasted Bread Crumbs.""  The quoted part is from their description.  The word fondue is used very loosely.  The chicken was nicely grilled and seasoned well.  The meat was very juicy.  Course 3:  I got the Strawberry Mascarpone cheesecake with the center filled with a rhubarb mixture.  Excellent dessert.  Service was very good.  It was relaxed although the place was crowded and I was taking up a primo spot on the patio.  Iced tea was refilled often.  The courses were spaced nicely so I got to enjoy 3 fountain shows during the meal.  It really is a nice spot  and it's a place to which I'll return.  That after all is part of why restaurants participate in Restaurant Week."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have salmon at least twice a week each time at a different restauarant so you can call me a salmon connoisseur. Had the salmon here for dinner. It was really good. I'd recommend it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I live in Vegas and wanted to bring my mom for a nice belated Mothers day Dinner with a View. I had made my reservation in advance but after reading previous reviews  i knew the patio was first come first serve. We got there on a Monday 50 min before our 6:45 reservation and the patio already had a 2 hour wait list. We had a drink and a app at the bar while we were waiting for our (near the window) seat & i was kind of bummed and thinking of going somewhere else.   Just in time the hostess walked up & said she knew i wanted something special for my mom and she was able to get me the front row best view table on the patio. Right when we sat down  the fountain started the show and my mom was crying because it was so nice! (Naturally i tipped the host for her Epic service)   Michelle was our server who was DA BEST and didn't rush us at all and recommended the best martinis and entrees. She even brought out a cute mothers day dessert for my mom at the end of the meal.   I had the Veal ravioli & my mom the Steak which were both perfect but a little on the cold side. However  i didn't take away points because the service and ambiance were great.   Definitely worth the price and wait! We will def. be back but only if we get to sit with Michelle!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overall experience is terrific. Ask for the patio so you can enjoy the water show. You may have to wait a little longer but it's worth it. They have heaters so if it's not windy  even a winter evening dinner is pleasant.   The bread choices are great...especially the raisin rolls. Like every place on the strip  the food and drink is expensive. The atmosphere on the patio is cool as you can enjoy both the location and your table mates since you can actually hear them talk!  Our server Michelle was excellent. Ask her for recommendations and you won't be disappointed. She suggested doing a half and half Pasta plate with the butternut squash tortelli and ricotta ravioli - an awesome combination.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here for lunch while on my last trip to Vegas. We got there right when it opened which is key to getting a patio table to view the waters show.   The food was really quite delicious. My friend and I shared a fig and balsamic flat bread --which was sinfully delicious! I would highly recommend this one if you're a fan of those flavors.   For my entree I ordered the ravioli and my friend ordered the carpaccio. She out-ordered me for sure! The carpaccio was not only gorgeous to look at but tasted amazing.  The ravioli was okay but nothing special. I also think it was a tad expensive for what it was  and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There appear to be much better options on the menu here that will blow you away more than the ravioli.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really want to give Olives 4-starts  but I just can't do it.  Yes  Olives IS located inside Bellagio and yes  it is the restaurant of a Celeb chef... and yes  that must mean they can severely over charge.   Unfortunate really  because even as a couple that very much enjoys lovely restaurants and are rather adventurous diners  paying over $80 for two sandwiches  an appetizer for lunch and one iced tea is a bit absurd.   The food was good  we enjoyed it  we really did... but it wasn't $80 for lunch good ;)   Service was overall pretty good.  It didn't wow  but it certainly wasn't off.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English' Olives does have a lot going for it -- outstanding service  a great view over the Bellagio fountains  and some of the most amazing cocktails I have ever had (try the pear and also the apricot cocktails).  The reason for the 3 stars it the food  which was solid  but nothing to write home about.  We had the berry salad and octopus/squid starter  and for the entree the mahi mahi with risotto.  The salad was very good  but the octopus had a weird fishy taste and texture was not ideal.  The mahi mahi was enjoyable  but not spectacular or what you would expect for a $50 price tag.  Overall  Olives is a solid place  but with so many foodie destinations in Vegas  I would probably try something different next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If 0 stars was an option  that's what this restaurant would get.  If you want to watch a hot head owner treat his employees like crap  this is the place. If you want good food...go else where.  Ridiculous atmosphere. I don't give my money to assholes who act like clows.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The wait to sit at the outside patio overlooking the Bellagio fountains is minimum an hour if you're there on a weekend.   The atmosphere is tranquil and the decor is just plain niceee!!  The beef carpaccio and it's one dish that definitely stood out. This is a great choiice for a nice lunch or dinner. Definitely a must on your list of top Vegas restaurants.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is ok... well  the crab cakes were great... but the rest was just  ok especially for a celebrity chef destination.  Their best is feature is their wine list... very comprehensive and the prices were not too outrageous. I will go back if I get a hankering for those crab cakes.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wait for the Patio  it's beyond worth it.  Pray to the Food Gods that Olives assigns you to Ralph's section.  He is very knowledgeable about the menu and will let you take as long as you need to make the right choices.  Beef Carpaccio is one of the best appetizers I've ever put in my mouth.  The Peppercorn Crusted Beef Tenderloin was splendid.  The ambiance is stellar and the Bellagio fountains are amazing at night.  Notice to vegetarians: Not many options for you on this menu  you may want to look elsewhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It pains me to write a mediocre review for Olives. The balcony seats are beautiful and my wife and I fell in love with Vegas because of our experience the the first time we dined at olives.   Unfortunately our second visit did not live up and I'm sad to say that we will probably not be returning to this location. The view does not make up for all of its shortcomings. Let me start with the strong points - view  service  cocktails  and wine list. The food and moderately rude hostess are what don't hold up.  -Chilled avocado soup: very bland and uneventful -gazpacho: good... Nice spice but not really any other dimension -lobster wrap pasta: quite good  but at $45 it's really just average - prime filet: slightly overlooked and slightly dry and the sauce was blocked (and soaked up) by the potatoes. Plus you get what tastes to be a frozen crab cake plopped on the side of your plate that tasted a bit funky.  Unfortunately  this is when we gave up on this restaurant. I had half my plate thrown away  had our $150 bottle of wine corked  and disenchantingly requested our check. I mentioned some of the meals shortcomings to the waiter the end of the meal (my mistake for waiting) and made it clear I was not looking for discounts... I just wanted to pass on the feedback since it was a family favorite and we had such great memories from our first time here. Unfortunately I don't think the feedback was understood (probably just pegged us as a young couple that doesn't know what good dining really is)  but the waiter did graciously reduce the bill (slightly)  This was our last meal for our Vegas trip and unfortunately it was the worst. I'm left frustrated that I still don't have a proper steak to pair with the beautiful wine that remains on my counter
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My husband and I have been talking about this place  for a while and finally tried it tonight. First off our waiter was quite rude and made us feel like he was annoyed by us Being there. We asked how the menu worked since some places have smaller portions that ordering an appetizer  small plate and entree is necessary. Our waiter pointed to the menu in annoyance and said these are the appetizers  these are the entrees etc. well thank you captain obvious we figured that out when we opened the menu. So.... Are the portions a good size? If we split an app and got our meals will that be enough? We started off with the charcuterie  not a lot of meat and decent cheeses. Came with house made pickles that we could have done without. I ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was ok  the prosciutto was more chewy and ""ham"" like. My husband ordered the pesto cream sauce gnocchi. Everything was tasty but was almost soupy with the amount of pesto they put in it. Also the table Next to us had the same waiter and they asked him what scallops are  his reply was an annoyed ""it's fish"" well I wouldn't consider scallops to be a fish  maybe describe it as a shell fish similar to clam. Has a tender and sweet meat. Just saying. If you check this place out maybe just order a drink at the bar and split an app with a friend."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love Todd English and all his olive's chains.  Ordered food to go for our trip back to LA and loved the mediterranean vibe of the bar and the restaurant.  This place has a view of Lake bellagio so it just adds to the character and personality of the establishment.    We got the italian panini and it came with fried pickles and fried pepperoncinis.  They were spectacular even after sitting in the car for awhile before I opened up the food.    Also got the burger and fries  the burger came with onions sauteed in balsamic and it added to the mediterranean feel.    Really yummy.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not only was our food amazing  but our server couldn't have been better. His name was Joel L. and he helped ensure that we had the best experience! The ahi tuna tartare did not taste fishy at all and was the perfect sharing size for 2 people. I ordered the Atlantic salmon and it was cooked to perfection. Noise level is high so if you're looking for a quiet intimate dinner you might want to look elsewhere. Highly recommend!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Can't give this place enough stars. The food is spectacular- - can't go wrong!  And the staff and management are the best in both hospitality...and charisma!   It's a must every time we go to Vegas.  Ask for Curtis behind the bar!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really wanted to love this place and was looking forward to it.  The food was ok  but not memorable   Roasted beet salad was good but not amazing.  The peppercorn crusted beef tenderloin was cooked perfectly but everything else on the plate was meh.  The ribeye au gratin was not good.  The desserts saved the whole thing - Chocolate collapsing cake and the strawberry shortcake.  Nothing could excuse the coffee however....brown hot water - nasty.  The view was nice and the waitstaff was excellent.  The food was completely disappointing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing Italian food  some of the best I ever had.   I'm generally not a huge fan of pasta  but the chestnut raviolis tasted so homemade and just melted in your mouth.  Try and sit outside for great views of the animated Bellagio fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The perfect lunch!  We were fortunately enough to arrive to ""the best seat in the house "" patio seating facing the Bellagio fountains with perfect weather to boot. Amazing views definitely created a romantic atmosphere for my girlfriend and I.  All meals are served with an assortment of bread that comes with a unique tray of both black and green olive dip. It also comes with full olives as well.  - Beef Carpaccio $18 - AMAZING. My girlfriend doesn't generally like non-fish meats all that much  but we both LOVED this dish. It is a huge serving for only two people and will fill you up. Cited by our waiter as ""Olives' best dish."" JUST ORDER IT. - Black Olive Gnocchi - for her. I believe this was a special. My girlfriend loved it. - Flank Steak $28 - One of their specials. It was good. Not anything out of this world  but I enjoyed it. - Three Seasons Sorbet $6 - A good dessert. Seasonal and reasonably priced. - I don't recall how much drinks cost here  but I don't remember it being anything over the top.  Service was exceptional. Our server was witty and the staff was conscious as to not interrupt picture taking  even offering to take pictures for us. I was drinking water like crazy that day and never reached the bottom of my glass.  If it is a special occasion  it is definitely worth waiting for patio seating. Lunch being just over $100 for two  this is definitely a ""special occasion"" type restaurant and lives up to expectations.  Out of all the Vegas restaurants my girlfriend and I tried together  we both agreed Olives was ""THE"" restaurant we were excited to return to. Great food and perfect service earns Todd English's Olives a perfect 5 star rating."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was pretty good. The service was not so good.  Sit outside for sure  if you are there when its warm enough. It is a great view of the Bellagio fountain show that goes every 15 minutes at night.  We had a reservation around 8pm. We decided that we wanted to sit outside  so we put our names in and were told to come back in about an hour. (It was about 90 degrees outside  in the middle of August  but it was bearable.)  Super slow service.  They give you an iPad to view the drink menu  and it was super tricky to navigate. It's kind of a cool idea  but wasn't working well.  Fun experience but won't be going back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Mr. English - After  reading the mix reviews onYelp I picked your establishment. You took my $$$ and in return you gave me 1. Poor service 2. Food that was (1-2) star level and 3.  a feeling my time is of no value to your business. I see a business model of why care about the customer they are tourist they will not return and new ones line up my  reputation will carry me through this moment is a bad one. If you want to see the fountain at the casino and a nice dinner consider the view from the casinos near by. Eating here is the equivant of being seated at a Craps table. You will have better odds at the other casinos near by.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here this past weekend with my family for my mom's birthday. I had made a reservation 2 weeks in advance and requested to hopefully sit on the patio. The lady said she would put it in  but it isn't guaranteed  I said fine. We were so excited to finally eat here after all the reviews.  Something must have happened to the chef! First of all  the front desk lady was horribly rude and condescending. I told her I would love to have my requests met since this was a special occasion and my reservations were 2 weeks in advance. BE WARNED reservation or not  the patio is first come first serve. Great. This is the ONLY reason you would go to this restaurant and they know it.  She told me I had to wait 45 min. We had show tickets in about 2 hours that was cutting it close. That was a NO. She ROLLED her eyes and said ok  wait here then. Excuse me little lady  but get over yourself.  I politely asked ( I know you think I was rude  but seriously I was trying to have my polite Vegas face on when you try to get things your way)  asked her if we could get something close to the patio doors so we could at least see out the window.  This place is SO dark inside  that I was sure my dad would complain that he couldn't even see the menu. Yes  he did.  You know where there little hipster sat us? It was near the window...BEHIND the busboy/cashiers desk area. What view did we have? NOTHING. Urrrghhhhh Ok  well I thought the food would make up for it. No.  The food is so overpriced for what you get  and I dine out a lot am willing to pay for a great meal (at Atelier the portions are 2-3 bites for $20+ COMPLETELY worth it).  Oysters- SALTY  bland and yuck. You get 4 in an order for $17 Carpaccio- Ok this was not bad. It was not the best  but ill give them this one. Ceaser Salad- $17- Good. How could anyone mess this one up. Count them...1 ....one.... crouton in the salad. Thats right.  Mahi Mahi- SALTY and not not not worth $45 Steak- Edible  good portion  you can have better elsewhere Salmon- ok.  Complimentary dessert for mom's birthday- 3 pea sized truffles. Wow do they splurge or what.! Seriously  our waiter was excellent  friendly and funny. The food was not memorable or good.  Total bill was around $250 for 4 people that are including a beer and a bottle of wine ($34).  ONLY go here if you have having drinks on the patio. So many other choices in Vegas. Will never come here again. 2 stars for the waiter and the ok steak/salmon. Thats it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  great ambiance! I had the pan seared jumbo scallops and my boyfriend had the salmon on the special menu. The four large scallops were so tender and smooth and the salmon was lightly crisp on the outside and very moist on the inside. The food arrived promptly as I enjoyed the salty  but addicting olive spread and bread. If you sit on the patio  you can watch the water show at the Bellagio. Unfortunately  there was a private event on the patio that night. Our table for two was also very tight  but wonderful experience overall.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Good spot here! English's NYC and Boston restaurants I believe are the first but this joint has been around about 10 years I believe.  We went for lunch and my wife had the tuna carpaccio: olive oil mashed potatoes  crisp pasta cracker  lemon aioli  capers & parsley. I tried a bite  good carpaccio but for my tastes not to the level of some of Yoshi's Oakland recent offerings (tuna wise). She also had the alla napoletana flatbread: tomatoes  roasted onions  buffalo mozzarella  shaved parmigiano-reggiano  tomato sugo  arugula  basil - decent.  I had this wonderful dish  one of those few dishes that after reading the description on the menu delivers above expectations: grilled squid & octopus: vinaigrette of chickpeas  tomatoes  toasted garlic & parsley.  Easily some of the best octopus i've ever had.  Starting w/ 5 stars i drop two for: 1) asked server to make my margarita w/ just herradura  lime  cointreau NO sweet & sour or simple syrup. Tasty margarita but served instead WITH sweet & sour (I thought he was french  wife thought maybe German? i'm bad w accents I guess  but def. a language problem) and horrible beer selection.  No belgians unless you call that swill Stella Artois a belgian (Belgiums version of Budweiser  perhaps! InBev having just purchased Budweiser!).   Enjoying a barley pop at this place is taken so lightly that they've even managed to spell Newcastle Brown Ale ""New Castle"".   But the wine list looked great w/ 2g$ cristal and a 1999 louis roederer magnum at a paltry (for Bellagio standards! the restaurant is at Bellagio) 5g$.   Wife had a fine Chalone chard at a mere 16$/glass.  Each started w/ a perfectly serviceable Bellini.   Check it out."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were planning to go to Le Cirque for dinner with my wife but we didn't like the atmosphere at Le Cirque so we decided to try Olive prior to seeing O. We had to wait 40 minutes but we sat down and had a wonderful meal. The Tuna Tartar was probably the best I have ever had and we had the Fig and Prosciutto flat bread was great but little too sweet for me as an appetizer. Also the banana Tiramisu was great. We enjoyed it so much that we decided to go back the next night and go early so we can try to sit outside. We made reservations and then had to wait an hour for outside which was worth it. Again  the food was great and view was incredible.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food. Horrible music ruined patio experience
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great place. Food and service both top notch. A bit pricey but overall a great restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I cannot rave about this place enough. I stumbled upon it by accident after playing poker at the bellagio when I was heading back to valet. Sat myself at the bar and began nibbling on the tapenade and breads which was excellent. I recommend the olives  burger with the truffle fries. Both were outstanding and cooked just right. For Dessert (and I only have dessert if I've enjoyed the entree) I had the chocolate peanut which was very good. I would certainly return to olives because the service above all was outstanding.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The ambiance at this place is phenomenal  the service is good. The food is delicious  I love the tuna tartar. It is exquisite and flavorful! The only thing there is a Lady taking pictures and she is a bit pushy to sell them at an overinflated price  I didn't like that.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Messed up my reservation. I was so upset since I was taken here for my bday dinner before a show. Sat at the bar while they sort out the seating~ and within 10 minutes or so they got the table ready outside the patio~ Started off in bad note however they made things right so I am going to move on~  Food was delicious plus the view was quite beautiful~   I had the butternut squash tortelli~ very good! My friend had the pasta special forgot the name but with lot of seafood  which was also very good! The Fig & prosciutto flat bread was great~ however with the tortelli and the bread basket it was too much food for me~   It's a restaurant you'd want to check out if you are on dining venture in Las Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had the wonderful pleasure of having lunch at Olives this past weekend. We were seated on the patio overlooking the Bellagio ""lake."" While we were eating we were treated to the fountain shows. The only downside was that it was bloody hot  but there were water misters above the umbrellas and the waiters were good about re-filling your water glass.  YOU MUST order the flatbread. Crisp and delicious and very good quality olive oil drizzled on top of course. We tried the prosciutto and fig variety.  We also had the grilled octopus and squid for appetizers. I wasn't to crazy about the crab cake sandwich that I had  but the other entrees ordered--lamb chops  grilled chicken breast  pulled pork and hamburger were great!!!  Great treat  definitely Vegas Worthy!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was very impressed with Olives. We came on Saturday night around 8:30 and the place was packed. The hostess said there were no more reservations for two available  but we got lucky and two seats opened up at the bar.   The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful.  Attentive  knowledgeable and friendly staff.  Beautiful bar with lots and lots of drink possibilities (and very talented bartenders).  Now onto the food. Our server brought us warm bread and a plate of olives. The plate had both green and black olive tapenade in addition to a selection of whole olives with garlic. The bread was slightly sweet thanks to a few raisins in each piece  which made for a wonderful contrast with the flavor of the olive tapenade. This was a great way to start the meal.  We started with the Napoletana Flatbread. The ingredients were pretty good  but not the best; the Parmesan did not taste like the authentic Parmigiano Reggiano I would have expected. However  the dish overall was quite good  with a fun balance of tastes and textures.  For our entrees  we got the Chestnut Ravioli and the Butternut Squash Tortelli. The Chestnut Ravioli had a wonderful flavor that seemed to deepen throughout the tasting experience. I found myself leaning back in my chair near the end of a bite  completely awestruck by how interesting and flavorful the ravioli was. The sauce didn't seem to have much flavor  but the spinach and parmesan cheese complemented the ravioli very well. The Butternut Squash Tortelli (i.e. big tortellini) were great as well  though some may think they're a bit too sweet.  Overall  a wonderful dining experience for not too much money. Additionally  the restaurant is situated right next to the fountain outside the Bellagio  which means you can see the fountain show from inside the restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was OK. Very loud and the food was decent but not worth the hype.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When you talk about a dining experience  it gets no better in Vegas than Olives! From the Martinis  appetizers  entrees  and desserts  it stands above the rest. Set in a relaxing atmosphere overlooking the fountain. Mixed with a staff that remembers faces and names always. You can't go wrong in Vegas
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I ate there on 8-7-15  The food and service was outstanding! Our waiter Rick exceeded all our expectations! Rick is the kind of employee that makes a business succeed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a party of 6 go here for a 30th birthday party. Our waiter Paul was GREAT. He made the experience what it was. All of our drinks and food were top notch  there wasn't one complaint about anything. By the time we were ordering dessert it was late and space cleared out on the patio so Paul brought us out there for dessert by the fountains. It was the best meal we have had in Vegas out of well over 100 restaurants
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not sure what all the fuss is about. It's a medium priced for Las Vegas and very noisy dinning establishment. So loud you can't talk to the people across the table from you. My sea bass was good but not wonderful. Cold in the middle but never could get the servers attention. There was a corn pudding that was cold and smeared on the plate as what appeared to be an afterthought.  My husband said his steak was good but not wonderful. They do give you a nice basket of bread and olive spreads before. With all the restaurants in Las Vegas this is not a hit. It's like a celebrity chef gave it his name and went away and said who cares
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Absolutely the best view of the bellagio fountains and the food and service are amazing. Dont skip the green beans.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,the ambience alone is reason to visit Olives. The bar was dimmly lit and sexy. It is so hard to find restaurants these days with nice  dim lighting.   I started off with the largest Martini of my life. Granted it was $14 but it was easily 3x the Martini I ordered at Ami Gabi at Paris the night before.  The octopus/squid app was wonderful. Almost a meal in itself with all the chickpeas.   Since I was full after the awesome bread basket and olive tepanade served two ways  I did not order a main. I will definetely be back and have a full meal next year.  The Irish bartender was a true delight. Wish more restaurant employees in Vegas were this personable and capable.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent service  very nice decor. Nice olives and tapanade for our fresh breads and delicious flatbread. Creamy avocado soup and lobster mousse was delicious.  Chilean sea bass cooked to perfection and the pineapple cake and coconut ice cream was yummy.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Oh my goodness  where to begin.  We arrived plenty early before our reservation and got a seat on the patio  with a perfect view of the fountains.    Our waitress was absolutely fabulous.  Thank you  Michelle  if you are out there!  She was so personable  helpful  and very funny.    The beef carpaccio was amazing  but the thing that really stood out was how much there was!  Most places will charge you $20 for a few strips of beef - the plate was piled high  and it could have been an entree by itself.    And the osso bucco was perhaps the best dish I've ever had (and that's saying something!)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great location  great view of the Bellagio Fountain Show from the patio  delicious food  fantastic service  and great spot to treat yourself or celebrate special occasions.  Came to Todd English's Olives for the first time during the 2011 Restaurant Week. The regular menu looks fantastic  and it has a solid reputation  so selecting Olives to try for their RW dinner menu was not a difficult decision.  The restaurant was busy  even though we are supposedly in an economic slump. So I was glad that we made a reservation two days earlier.  As far as RW2011's Dinner menu these are my thoughts:  First Course: I ordered the Crispy Pork Lollipops with Sweet Corn Raita and Calvados Demi Glaze.  It is basically pork ribs that are cooked until it is crispy  and unfortunately dry.  The best part of this dish is the Sweet Corn Raita.  I am glad I tried it  but would recommend the Shrimp Scampi Tart that my friends ordered instead.  The Shrimp Scampi Tart served with Fontina Cheese  Caramelized Onions  Red Bliss Potatoes  Sweet 100 Tomatoes  Garlic Butter Sauce and Sexy Scallions (yes  not just your plain old scallions but SEXY Scallions).  It is basically a mini-flat bread served on a bed of fancy salads.  The portion was relatively and was served on a wooden pizza peel.  **Highly recommend this if you opt for the RW Dinner Menu.**  Second Course: All of them are great!  But if I have to rank them it would be as follows:  1) Pan Seared Yellowtail Snapper; Cilantro Lime Risotto  Sauteed Red Belgian Endive  Brown Butter Emulsion.  Why? Because the fish was cooked perfectly  had great flavor and the the skin is nice and crispy while the rest of the fish was still moist.  And of the three entree options  is the healthiest and tastiest selection.  5/5  2) Braised Short Rib Lasagna; Horseradish Crema  Imported Brie  Fried Spinach  Toasted Crumbs.  Perfect for someone that loves a properly slow braised short rib  because they are very generous with it. And if you are expecting a medallion size portion  you will truly be surprised by the Claim Jumper portion that they serve you.  Big enough to share with your friends or hoard it all for yourself.  4/5  3) Grilled Prime Sirloin; Creme Fraiche Whipped Potatoes  Spicy Cauliflower and Green Harissa.  It is a good steak  but with so many restaurants serving fantastic steaks up and down the Strip  it wasn't a real standout or particularly memorable compared to the other two. (This was the one I ended up ordering btw).  3.5/5  Third Course: Choice of Vanilla Semifreddo with Marble Cake  Chocolate Sauce  Fresh Strawberries.  OR Banana Delight; Chocolate Fudge Cake  Banana Ice Cream  and Caramel Dipped Banana.  We all ended up ordering the Banana Delight  which was a pretty good dessert.    Service was good  no complaints what so ever.  4.5/5  Ambiance:  upscale dim lighting (great for romantic dinners  bad for taking food pictures)  comfortable seats  great view of the Bellagio Fountains. 4.5/5  Food:  4/5  Food and its presentation were both good.  Value:  5/5 RW Prix Fixe - awesome value for the meal and a portion goes to a worthy cause!  Location:  5/5  Call in advance and reserve patio seating for front row view of the hourly Bellagio Fountain Show.  Solid 4 sexy stars!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,unremarkable food and subpar service.  came here for dinner with a friend and was underwhelmed.  we ordered a few appetizers...one of them being octopus...it was over cooked and had a weird mushy texture...extremely unappetizing.  i also ordered steak for my entree (which rarely do)...i asked for medium rare and got medium.  wasn't asked to cut the steak to see if it was cooked to the right temperature.  and to make it worse  it was very chewy...took maybe 3 small bites at the most.  our server came by asked me if i was done...and took the plate away...he didn't even ask if i liked it.  will not be back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had one of the best experiences in my life here. My wife and I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday. Honestly we just went there to grab some good dinner but little did we know that we will have such a great experience. We asked our host for a table at the outside dining area and it was fabulous. If you are there for the dinner you will see the fountains of Bellagio every 15mins. Now the fountain show changes everytime  may be they have 5 plus different sequences not sure. But during our dinner we saw so many versions of the fountain show. Our server Nelson was great  he took extra care of us. When we said that we don't eat meat he made sure we get some good vegetarian food. We didn't plan a cake for my 30th as my wife and I both are healthy eaters and definitely cannot consume a whole cake. We went for a Tiramisu for the dessert and when our server found out that it is my Birthday  he wrote 'Happy Birthday' on the side of the dessert plate and lighted a candle. I think he went beyond his job to make sure we have a great evening. I would definitely recommend this place. It is also not expensive  given that it has a fountain overlooking view. Do check this place out if you are in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,4.5 stars  My experience here  from start to finish  was great. We arrived to our reservation early and sat at the bar while we waited for our table (which we requested to be outside and they were able to accommodate us if we waited til our actual time). The service at the bar was great  as were the other guests sitting there  and they even have iPads around that have the drink menu on it.   Once our table was ready they took us to a spot on the patio that had a perfect view of the famous Bellagio fountain show.  To start we ordered the grilled octopus--it was very tasty and fresh  but needed a tad of salt which we were able to season and once we did the favors popped. For dinner I had the scallops and my bf had the short ribs. My scallops were delicious-tasty  lightly seasoned and meaty. My boyfriend loved his dish as well. Service was also great  and we were not rushed at any point during our meal which I was really happy about.   Olives is definitely worth a visit and I would recommend this restaurant to anyone----but also make sure to sit on the patio to watch the fountain show as it's really awesome to see up close.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing!  Make sure you get the proscuitto and fig flatbread.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,lovely lovely. great carpacio- enough for a meal!make a reservation for a window seat or on the balcony overlooking the bellagio lake  water foundation. I would definately go back again. top notch all the way!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My girlfriend and I made reservations to go here 3 days in advance and planned our evening around our dinner.  Just by chance I called the restaurant to see if we could arrive a half-hour earlier.  Much to my amazement and disappointment  the hostess informed me that something happened in the kitchen earlier that day and they were closed for the rest of the night.  I would think that for paying top dollar at an upscale restaurant  the least they could do is inform you of this prior to your arrival...clearly that was not the case and  in my opinion  unacceptable for a restaurant of their prestige.  Needless to say this disrupted one of our nights on vacation.  Very disappointed  would not attempt another visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a great place! I was actually looking for a charcuterie board  which I knew may be hard to find in Vegas (complicated me). Olives did have one and it was EXACTLY what we were looking for.   We were kind of skeptical of going in because we were dressed very casual and Olives is fancy. :) The staff were very inviting and set a great tone from the start. We were able to enjoy our birthday meal and even got a birthday treat! They treated us very nice and the food is very very good. We tipped graciously  gave a high five and put it on our Vegas mainstay list. Thx Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate at Olive's a few years back and returned for a business dinner  it was just as good the second time as the first. Everyone enjoyed their meals and the great service. Highly recommend the flatbreads for an appetizer and the gnocchi for dinner. Try to get a seat near the windows so you can get a view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've been to Olives twice. The food is excellent  Todd English rocks!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriends brother got married in Las Vegas and i was so excited to go to Olive's  for dinner after the ceremony.  I had been there for lunch before and had a nice time.  There were 14 of us this time.  My boyfriend called the restaurant to make a reservation about 6 weeks ago and they recommended we sit at the 'farm table' since it was one long table that would fit our group.  He called to confirm the reservation and they again talked up how great it was that we were going to be at the farm table.  This farm table was in theory a nice idea  but it was in a semi-private room behind the kitchen.  It was the middle of July and I'm pretty sure it was cooler outside than at our table.  When we asked the manager about making it cooler  they said they knew the table was hot and they had been working with the hotel to make it colder.  If they knew the table was typically hot then why would you recommend a group sit there for a wedding dinner?  This was supposed to be one of the only days where the newly married couple shouldn't have had to worry about anything and instead of enjoying dinner with his new bride  the groom was up several times to talk to management about the heat.    On top of it being so hot and some people from the party having to leave because their side of the table was so unbearable  the service was absolutely awful.  Our server was not nice and did not even review the specials until someone asked if there were any.  He rushed us through ordering and when we ordered champagne he did not congratulate the bride and groom  he just asked who needed glasses for the bottle.  I had one bite of a salad because it was so hot and then spent the rest of the time going in and out of the restaurant.  The bite of the salad I had was fine  but the lettuce was a little wilted  maybe because it was so hot at our table.    I'm really not one to complain these days  but this was by far one of the worst dining experience I have ever had.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great restaurant!!!  Table was ready for our large group on time and had a great view of the show.  The pan roasted chilean sea bass might have been the BEST dish i've ever had.  Everyone was happy with their selections!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I've been dining at Olive's in the Bellagio since it first opened when the environment was much brighter in yellow & green ceramic tile. While the new look is a complete dramatic change of the original I can live with it. What I miss the the most  however  is the original friendly crew that always recognized their regular customers starting with the hostesses  the bartenders to the servers and the managers that had always welcomed in a engaging and courteous manner.  I've tried most everything on the menu and seem to always come back to my ultimate favorites:  *fig  prosciutto flat bread *boston bib salad *butternut squash tortelli  I've always started and ordered the White Chocolate Martini. There was an original recipe of this served when it first opened that many(including myself) came back to time after time. It was simple  yet decadent made of vanilla stoli  clear cream de cacao and a splash of something else. Then they would garnish it with a white & milk chocolate swizzle stick.  Today  if you ask for ""White Chocolate Martini"" they automatically give you a liquidy  creamy white concoction. When I've asked the bartenders I'd like it the original way..countless times the bartenders(that are no longer the originals) would argue with me saying they ""only"" do it in the white creamy way. However  I always seemed to get my special cocktail when I have to order more specifically for the original ""clear"" chocolate martini then amazingly these bartenders seem to know the exact recipe  though initially act as if they've never heard of such a cocktail. And after they finally make the cocktail(after wasting minutes in arguing) they wimp out on the chocolate garnish...unlike the decadent original way when the restaurant first opened.  Reservations:  This is probably the most challenged comment I could make of this place. When calling in for earlier dinners (that need to be followed by a show)  they always say that 6-8p.m. is all booked up and the earliest would be 10:30. However  I can count on my hand where I've brought groups of 4-6 to walk in with no reservations between 6 & 8p.m. where we were able to get a table immediately and get served.  The hostesses are not the friendliest of the bunch  unlike when the restaurant first opened.  And forget asking politely for a table on the balcony to watch the fountain show  they are extremely protective and act as if it is ""off limits"". Perhaps they reserve it for their favorite high roller guests or as long as they get a decent side tip in order to fulfill the request.  I'd say the more accurate defined ratings would be:  Food  Beverage:  five stars Environment:  three stars (five if you can actually get a table on the balcony. I miss the original friendlier esthetics) Service: two stars (due to the argumentative bartenders & the pompous hostesses)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Romantic  but a little loud.  However  a beautiful spot with excellent food and service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Hands down the best burger ever had. I've been going there for several years  and I have never had anything less than an exceptional cheeseburger at Olives  and by ""exceptional"" I mean PERFECT. Long after this civilization has fallen they will still tell tales of the Olives burger over camp fires and in space craft  Start with the braised squid and octopus app  which was just sick--even if you don't like octopus  you will love this--the dish was transcendent--Enough about the seafood---- strap in for a burgergasm.  The meat is a proprietary blend with the perfect grind and pressure applied when forming the large patties.  Med rare is the only way to go  and they always nail it. The burger had a perfect  salty crust and just juicy enough to saturate the bun without overloading it.  The meat to bun ratio was so precise  that the very last bite left my fingers dry with a cohesive bite of meat and bun which had the same mouth feel as the first.      * Perfect  deep  grilled sear.     * Seasoned inside and out.     * Toasted  moist brioche bun.     * Dry aged rib and sirloin fat cut back in for added flavor and moisture.     * Salty  white Cheddar  Dijon mustard only with this burger.  The fries--sweet gawd---the fries!  They were like savory  crispy packages of mashed potatoes with truffle oil and Parmesan---so good."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Oh-Mah-Gahhh  this place is so yummy.  Food: Fig + prosciutto flatbread - perfect blend of savory and sweet Porterhouse - for hungry patrons only! This thing is huge. The filet part of it was so tender! Rib eye - deee-licious Kobe beef tartare - not overly seasoned  beautiful texture/taste Alaskan salmon - not too heavy.  Could have been a little more tender  but overall  not bad.  Cocktails: Sidecar - so delicious  and I don't even like cognac.  It's the sugar + cinnamon rim that totally makes this drink Tiffany - if you like sweet  fruity drinks then this is definitely for you White cosmo - really light and refreshing  Even the bread basket here is good.  There's a round sweet  walnut type of bread in there.  Pair it with the green olive tamponade.  So gooood.  This would have been the PERFECT dining experience - divine food and fabulous service - if our party hadn't decided to sit outside.  We wanted a good view of the water show  but it's summer... in Vegas... was SOOO HOT.  It was awful.  :(  Even close to sunset  it was almost unbearable.  Really regretted not sitting indoors.  Can't wait to come back to try more food!  Pastas look so good too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for a romantic dinner for two. Made reservations day early  unfortunately  couldn't reserve a specific table. Upon arriving  there was a 45 minute wait for the table we wanted (porch). We were instead seated at a significantly small table with a neat candle lit and instantly asked for drink preferences. The food: Not surprised. It wasn't amazing nor disappointing. I will certainly choose an alternative for a romantic different. Not worth the money.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I enjoyed my meal here last April -- we had a reservation and were seated quickly.  The ambiance is beautiful.  The food here  while tasty -- compares to an average San Francisco restaurant but with Vegas prices.  A great place to eat at a reasonable price point (read: $40 entrees)  if you can't afford the more upscale celebrity chef restaurants.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here last minute on Sunday after the O show and got right in. We were seated indoors but right next to the windows so we had a nice view of the fountains.  A lot of the nice restaurants at the bellagio are TOO fancy fancy for me. I don't understand half the stuff on the menu. This place seemed like a good choice after reading the reviews.   My boyfriend and I shared the oysters  beef carpaccio  and portebello flatbread pizza.   The beef carpaccio was one of the best things I've ever tasted. I don't know what it is about it  but it really does melt in your mouth. My boyfriend loved it as well. I really can't wait to go back for more.  Oysters were good  and flatbread pizza was yummy too...nothing spectacular  but the crust is perfectly thin and crispy.  And the pricing is not bad at all! Our total came out to $64 w/o alcohol.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was such a treat.  Came in for a late lunch with my sister and was able to get a table on the patio overlooking the beautiful fountains. Tried a couple items  and everything tasted absolutely splendid. The bread basket was a great start. Then had:  Tuna Carpaccio - delicious. Grilled Squid and Octopus - great combination of ingredients and flavor  Portobello Flatbread Scallops and Prosciutto - amazing flavor. the sauce is very complimentary. risotto made perfectly PEI Mussels - perfect  I don't think there is anything on this menu that would disappoint me. Everything is prepared perfectly from the fresh ingredient combination  to the medley of flavors and the beautiful presentation. And of course to top it off  a great server.  For dessert though  we ordered the apple cinnamon thing  which was like a cinnamon roll (don't care for it at all). But the other dessert was some type of pb&j mousse cake  which was amazing and different from the traditional cakes and pastries.  Might be a bit pricey  but sometimes we have to treat ourselves :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The Gnocchi and Ocotopus Salad were some of the best I've ever had! The view of the fountains was amazing. This is by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beautiful evening arrived at 4:30 to wait in line for outdoor table.  Table had perfect view of Bellagio fountains. Food was good.  Loved the refreshing summer Sangria.  Pasta ravioli was good. Bread and olive tampenade were tasty.  Lamb chops delicious. Gnoggi okay.  Ambience and evening fabulous. Worth waiting in line to sit outside in a beautiful evening. Would be a great date night location.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was good  but the hostess was very judgmental. We arrived early for our reservation because we gave ourselves extra time from leaving our show. We arrived early and the hostess said they were fully booked  so to come back at our scheduled time. We wandered for a bit and then came back. While we were still waiting for a table  a couple came up to the desk. I was close enough to hear their conversation and could see that the man said that he didn't have a reservation but tried to slip the other hostess some cash to get an immediate table. She refused  which I greatly appreciated since I had been waiting with a confirmed reservation.   The hostess we had spoken with  however  decided to sit them in a prime spot overlooking the fountains. We had to wait about 5 minutes after that couple were seated and were seated in a less-than-desirable location that was much closer to the restaurant entrance than the prime table for two near the fountains. While the food was great  I was totally turned off by the original hostess and her attitude toward my friend and me.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food is good  not great and the view is amazing. I've been here twice and both times thought the staff was not that friendly but they do a good job.  The ladies at the host station aren't very welcoming and when I tried to get a reservation for my group of seven last night they acted like I was stupid and inconveniencing them. Gave me a bad feeling and I probably won't go back but overall it's a good place to eat if you want an amazing view.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Well worth the wait! We waited about 1.5 hours to be seated outside on a weekday but we planned well and got their 2 hours before getting deathly hungry. :) Thanks yelpers for the heads up!   Now onward to the awesomeness of finally being able to eat behind the Bellagio fountains. It is just that  it's awesome and it tastes good. We got the Beef Carpacchio and the aged rib eye. Both were fantastic. The breads were good  the olives were amazing  and the waiter was so-so. He forgot my Iced Tea like 3 times. It's all good though.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"A recent visit to Vegas (with my good friends no less) brought me to this wonder restaurant. Can't say too much about the place since it was my first time... but I'll say this... PERFECT for a dinner date. I'd suggest sitting outside so you can watch Bellagio's water show (don't worry they have heat lamps!).   As for the food  it was a bit dry (i had the duck leg). Maybe it's the chinese in me that's screaming ""DON'T GET IT"" but I'd recommend getting something a little more juicy. This place gets a ""four"" though because the wine more than made up for the food!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There's a reason that I eat at Olives almost every time I visit Las Vegas: its fantastic.    I love everything about this place: the restaurant is gorgeous (remodeled since I was last there) and the service is flawless.  Fun cocktails and an extensive wine list  too.  But the food really stands out amongst a lot of other overpriced restaurants on the strip.  I used to be a fan of the beef carpaccio (back in the day when I ate meat)  and I've had dreams about the butternut squash tortellini... scrumptious!  Try a flat bread pizza as an appetizer to share.  The halibut and fennel is nice  too.    Go figure  now I'm hungry!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my favorite restaurants of all time is Olives. I came here for brunch  lunch and dinner before and I always order the beef carpaccio. It's to die for! I've also tried their flat breads  which are pretty big for one person. Their pasta is really good and they give perfect portions.  They do get busy  especially on long holiday weekends  so be sure to make reservations! Although they are busy at times  their service is wonderful and that's what makes them one of my favorite restaurants.  Last time we came here  we got outdoor seating and got to watch the Bellagio Fountain show 4 times. It was great! =) Can't wait to go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,During a recent stay in Vegas  we had a fantastic lunch at Olives. Reservations are a must if trying to sit out on the patio  and it was well worth it. The ambiance out on the patio is just really special and makes the whole experience that much better.   On to the food. A couple of the plates we had were a little out of the norm  but the chefs must know what they're doing when dreaming this stuff up. Crab meat sprinkled over flatbread as an appetizer & gigantic scallops sliced in half with marinated shredded short rib meat. Wow! And the butternut squash tortelli were perfect. You can tell with the first bite when you are eating freshly made pasta and these tortelli were the real deal. The banana tiramisu really stood out for me from dessert. I've tried tiramisu in many different restaurants all over the world  and this was a first. You have to try it if you are a tiramisu fan.  Overall  we had a wonderful meal and looking forward to coming back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,what an awesome place to have business lunches!!! this place is so beautiful on the inside.   I just love the milk chocolate ceiling accented with the twisted dark brown wood kinda of resembling the toyota emblem.  hanging from the ceiling are these huge white hanging paper lights that looked like white upside down cylindrical candles with lights around the rim.  i also have to add that the view from our table was phenomenal because it over looked the bellagio fountains with the eiffel tower filling the background.  also  when the sun would get into the eyes of a customer  the blinds would lower to protect the customer from blinding light  and raise again when the sun moved away.   back to the food...since the place is called olives  the red seeded whole and mashed and green seedless whole and mashed olives were yummy when smeared on any of the bread selections.  we started out with the tuna carpaccio which was a big slab of raw tuna topped w lemon ailoli and capers over a bed of greens and a pasta cracker.  i could have really done without the greens b/c it added a bitter flavor to the tuna.  then it was followed by a flatbread topped with asparagus bechamel  prosciutto  caramelized onions  and i also think fig.  oh the taste was sensational  first you feel the crispiness of the flat bread breaking in your mouth  then you taste the salty prosciutto  and then the sweetness from the onions and the fig surprise your mouth.  this is a recommended order people!!! for the entree  i had the jumbo sea scallops with pancetta risotto.  eh...shouldnt have ordered that.  my colleague who has been raving about this place always orders that.  dont get it.  i will return to this place b/c of ambiance  great flat bread  and an entree that caught my eye....Goat Cheese Stuffed Pork Chop (this sounds so heavenly). i also would have ordered the grilled squid and octopus  and beef carpaccio appetizers.  next time ill go w/people who will try anything.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives provided a perfect evening.  The food was exceptional and the outdoor seating overlooking the fountains provided the ideal ambience.  Beautiful!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my absolut favorites for lunch - sit outside and enjoy an extraordinary cocktail:)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,New Favorite Lunch spot in Vegas! The service is friendly and the views gorgeous if you get the right table. The start you off with a bevy of breads and crackers with their tapenades...oh so good.  The BEST Carpaccio I've never had. It is $18  but you get a ton of meat and the dish could certainly stand alone as a meal. For our mains  we had the flatbreads. One was a fig and prosciutto and the other the Italian  with all the staples and grilled perfectly. The size was decent as well and we had leftovers to take.  On a Sunday  it was not hard to get a table and one with a view to boot. Highly recommend this place!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Price: expensive Atmosphere: Beautiful Service: Excellent Food: Interesting  Business lunch 2ppl  I did not expect such a limited menu  I ordered the Bronx Bomber (pepperoni pizza flatbread) Good not great. Love this place but the menu did not match the name and atmosphere.........Love the Bellagio hotel so it gets 4 stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very upsale restaurant. We dined at lunch time  menu was limited. Food expensive. Not worth it in my opinion.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have probably eaten here 10 times and the Beef Carpaccio is the reason.  5 stars alone for this dish.  It is hard to describe  you just have to believe me and try it yourself.   I have been pregnant the last 4 visits  and since I must refrain from consuming raw items  I have had a chance to finally try other items on the menu.  The Scallop entree and the Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread- are also 5 star worthy. But the other dishes I have tried (olives burger  butternut squash tortelli  roasted chicken dish) are a hair above average- thus the 4 star rating as a whole.   The view is amazing  the service is fabulous  and reservations are a must!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had lunch here with co-workers. Good ambiance  but the food was just OK. I had the crab stuffed shrimp which weren't bad but nothing to write home about. Service was also on the mediocre side. However  the flatbreads looked pretty good  though I didn't try them....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was one of the most enjoyable meals of my entire life.  Sitting along the beautiful Bellagio fountains  and with an incredible menu of temptations  how could we miss?  Lets start with the drink menu.  Long  really long  and lots of interesting choices.  I went with their 18K drink  a mix of Grey Goose LOrange and various other ingredients  just perfect.  My entree was an unbelievable cut of Salmon paired with a delicate risotto.  The presentation and taste was divine.  I almost licked the plate.  Dessert was a must  and I went with a chocolate lave cake.  It was brought out just as the fountains began to dance for us!  So sweet  rich  and perfect.  Service is wonderful  and very knowledgable.  Go ahead  splurge on Olives  you won't regret it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Where to start! This place is absolutley amazing. Our waiter Paul treated us like family and made us feel very welcomed. He made sure we were welltaken care of and enjoying our dinner experience. What an experience! The view next to the Bellagio fountains was breathtaking and the food was absolutley to die for! While there the restaurant manager Sean Michael checked in with us to make sure things were well. Overall it was one of the greatest dining experiences I've ever had  I will be returning soon!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food  bitchy hostess staff!  My hub and I hit Vegas every summer  it's our time to reconnect sans teenagers.   We're farily easy to please  good food  good wine  good Lord we're thrilled! This is in the Bellagio where we were staying  made reservations  asked for a table Al Fresco  arrived and snooty little hostess sat us at a tiny little two top near the kitchen door.  We weren't rude  we asked (again) for a table outdoors (which overlooks the magnificent Bellagio Fountain show) and told her her we were happy to to camp at the bar and have a cocktail if need be watiing for a table outdoors. She rolled her eyes and walked away from without a word and headed back to the hostess stand.  We followed like scolded little kids assuming we were supposed to.    She murmored something to someone else at the front and walked away.  We ended up getting our table and were thrilled but since we travel alot to Vegas the economy really has taken it's toll there and most restaurants are not full even on weekends so they can't afford to leave a lasting impression like this little bitch did.    At any rate  the Tapenad (spelling?) was awesome  waiter was very helpful with wine and meals.  Steaks were wonderful and we enjoyed the romtantic atmosphere watching the Bellagio light show provided. There are ODDLES of restaurant choices so we prob wont' return here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Consistently delivers outstanding food quality. In our numerous visits to Olives we have never been disappointed.  Highly recommend their espresso martini
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love their carpaccio  this is definitely a must-try!! It was so good so I ordered two!  They have good appetizers and dessert.   Service was great!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,my favourite place for a power lunch  or   awesome dinner  if it's not too hot  sit outside and enjoy the amazing view  try the flatbreads the desert & apparently the martinis  and then do some shopping!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Well its between a 2 and 3 star restaurant on the food. Yes I have had better. The one dish to stay away from is the Calamari / Octopus appetizer. Its a very ill composed dish. There's garbanzo bean puree garbanzo  beans and more beans. Both the octopus and calamari overcooked. It just doesn't all go together its ill conceived .  We also ordered the Brick chicken. Which was not Brick chicken at all. If you have ever had brick chicken its moist and tender and flattened. This was just oven roasted chicken. Service was good  although our water poured water into our Pelligrino  sparkling water.  It's OK  but I have had better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing food!!!  Tried the beef carpaccio and cheese board appetizers and they were to die for!! The free bread was amazing as well and so was banana tiramisu pie!! Had to book a reservation three weeks in advance but I think they accept walk-ins as well--just expect to wait a while.   Service was fabulous! Topped off my water every five minutes and came to check on us multiple times--but never to the point where it got annoying.   Very upscale  fine dining  and EXPENSIVE!! So expect to pull out your cash money!! Totally worth the visit if you like American/Italian food! Be sure to ask the waiter what's good too! They will recommend several dishes for you to chose from!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"One of the few places that exemplify perfection. Lets leave talking about the food until the end. I have visited this establishment twice with no room for complaint.   Ambiance: The ambiance is breath taking. Sitting outside you get a gorgeous view of the Bellagio fountain show  when the weather permits. Sitting inside is not as satisfying  it is a little dark and subdued. If you are looking for romantic the outside patio is incomparable. The wait staff is friendly and professional. One more thing I must add is that this is a good place for lunch because if you do sit outside you want it to be sunny so you can get a picturesque view of the strip and ""Lake Belagio"".   Food: They bring out some very nice basket of  breads with a variety of olives and olive tapenade (hence the name olives  get it). Items that I have tried:  Beef Carpaccio (usually always on the menu)  perfectly executed. For those who are squeamish about raw food or meat  be a little adventurous it will pay off.  Lobster Risotto (seasonal) this is one of the highlights  phenomincal  comes in a light cream sauce  perfectly cooked arborio rice  with plump chunks of lobster meat.  Lamajoun Flatbread - has ground lamb on it  I know that some american palates find lamb troubling  I myself am a fan of GOOD lamb. This pizza-esque dish made for a great appetizer for four. Ricotta Ravioli - I personally do not like ricotta on the west coast  usually it is unseasoned and flavorless  not at olives. The sauce is vivid and with the sausage crumbles  these scrumptious and al dente firm pockets of well seasoned ricotta just shine.   Abbondanza!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Decided to give Olives a try after looking at the menu for dinner.  They have an extensive wine list which I appreciate.  The cheese and meat platter along with a bottle of wine was perfect as a first course.  The three of us enjoyed our entrees and the attentive wait staff.  We were too full to try dessert so next time.  We will definitely be back!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Offers a view of Lake Bellagio. But I suggest not sitting outside  only because the fountains WILL sprinkle you and your food. Our group tried the butternut squash  alaskan salmon  veal  spaghetti for the kids  and the scallops. The butternut squash is great  although best for a vegetarian (such as myself). The salmon was great as well  goes perfectly with the couscous. The scallops are not pescetarian friendly  as they have beef on the bottom? And my mother was able to call them to custom make me a cake for my 21st birthday month celebration. Service was impeccable. OH  and the bread that comes before the meal  A MUST TRY. The olive spread is AMAZING. Oh  and since I am newly 21  I tried their pear cocktail and cranberry cocktail. MMM (they card you  heads up! lol). And. Right next to Dior and Bottega. A fashionista's dream.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love this spot at Bellagio. Has in my opinion the best view of the Fountains as long as you can get out on their elevated patio. Cool scene inside that is also very intimate and close quartered. Great for Lunch or Dinner. Love the beef carpaccio strapped over fresh arugula with capers.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food! The portions were just right and everything was very delicious. We made a reservation online about 15 minutes before arriving and were seated upon arrival  this was on a Friday evening and they were quite busy with a good crowd waiting for a table so I suggest making a reservation on your way over. For the type of dining and food the price was on point. Our waitress brought out a neat cream puff dessert with our names and anniversary on it  pretty thoughtful as the mention of it being our anniversary was just said in passing  so very observant staff. I def. would recommend checking this place out!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I describe Olives as a huge disappointment.  It has the formula to be a great restaurant.  There are friendly hostesses seating you on time for your reservation in a beautifully appointed dining room  a nice drink/wine list  and an interesting menu.  However  the execution is terrible or at least it was for our dinner experience on a Friday night.  First of all  we were seated or crammed into a table about a foot and a half away from people on each side.  Second  we did not get our drinks for fifteen minutes and did not even get water for ten.  When our waiter finally appeared  he told us how busy he was and tried to get sympathy because some old man was demanding.  Okay  we gave him the benefit of the doubt until I asked him a question about the menu and his answer was  ""You know  I am going to have come back because I really need to wait on that table.""  So much for us sitting there not being helped for fifteen minutes...ugh.  With regards to the food  it was above average.  The bread and olive tapenade was commendable.  The boston bibb salad fell in the alright category.  The true winner for us was the portobello flatbread.  I can imagine that if I would have had a salad and flatbread for lunch  I would probably be writing a much better review.  Then  my husband had the risotto special and I had the halibut.  The fish was flaky and quite tasty  but I could not even dent it  it was so large.  The risotto was undercooked and lacked pizazz.  All in all  a disappointing experience and not one living up to the name or price of Todd English.  I think it is time for him to drop in on his Vegas restaurant to see how things are going."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have made serveral trips to Vegas over the years and this is still one of my favorite restaurants  honestly anywhere.  I love the bread  I love the olive spreads  and the atmosphere is great.  The flatbreads and salads are fantastic  and perfect to split with a friend for a full meal.  Price is reasonable and the perfect lunch in a crazy town.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I were in Las Vegas during the week of July 11  2016 for our anniversary.  We dined at Olives on the 13th.  First of all our waiter Richard was very nice and attentive.  We had the beef carpaccio which always a must for me when I dine here.  It was good but has been better in the past.  Next I had the lamb entree while my wife had the scallop entree.  The lamb was cooked to order but I found it lacking seasoning  maybe a bit more salt.  It was fine but nothing great.  My wife's scallops were lukewarm and the risotto was bland.  We shared the chocolate peanut lava cake.  At the end of our meal I was very disappointed with it as a whole.  I expected more as I have dined here before and the food was awesome!!  Very disappointed as I feel that the quality in the food has slipped.  I feel that they could have done more in terms of recognizing our anniversary for the price we paid to eat at the restaurant.  This restaurant use to be a must eat at for me whenever I'm in Vegas but sadly will be a pass for me the next time I'm in town.  I would have given Olives 2 1/2 stars but don't have that option.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great.  I loved the place.  The food was excellent and the service was good!  We had a party of 10+ but we didn't have reservations for lunch.  We asked how long it would take  and I forget exactly how long they said  but it was certainly a long time.  But soon the hostess returned and told us that we could be seated.  They had a big table in the back  I'm thinking it was the chef's table  but she seated us there  asking first if we minded.  Obviously we didn't and plus we could look outside and catch the Bellagio water show going on.    I had the butternut squash tortellini.  It was AMAZING.  If you're a butternut squash fan  you'll love this.  I wasn't really expecting much because I wanted a light lunch  but it was impressive.  The sauce that came on top of the tortellini was really good  and the butternut squash inside was smooth and sweet.  They also serve bread for appetizers along with signature olive spread and olives  they were just as delicious  as a starter. :)  I also tried the pizza with figs.   It was a fairly big personal pizza  and the figs on it tasted amazing  it was a nice touch on the piece  definitely creative and tasteful.  The server was also really friendly  and even brought over another server friend to intro us to some night-life places to head to  and places that he can help us get into.  Very friendly people  nice ambiance  YUM food! :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My husband made a reservation for my birthday  he requested the fountain view but of course was not guaranteed. We arrived 40 min early & the hostesses were so overwhelmed  didn't even say happy birthday to me & told us to wait an hour & a half for the view.  We took the regular table  the restaurant was so packed  we were literally next to other tables & it was super loud we couldn't have a conversation so we left.   The restaurant doesn't not provide a memorable experience  they should focus in quality & not quantity!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Two words: Beef. Carpaccio.  Everything else was okay  but the beef carpaccio here is a definite standout.  Stop in for drinks and appies  you won't be disappointed!  I was in for a bachelorette party  so I was mainly focused on drinks (which were delicious  from what I recall...)  It's a solid place to go with a small group - the service is on point  the food is better than average  and of course  it's strip prices.  I'm telling you though...even if you're a vegetarian - make an exception for the beef carpaccio!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I went here tonight for dinner and had a great time! Wished i would have ordered a small appetizer to go with my meal! I got the ricotta ravioli  which was light and savory at the same time. Small portion but i was able to leave room for a molten chocolate and peanut butter lava cake for dessert! Our waitress was playful and professional  offering us "" coffee? Espresso? Tequila?!"" after our meal. Loved it! Cocktails were tasty too! I will definitely be going back!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Try to get a table on the patio - you'll get agree at view of the water show.  Drinks are excellent and fresh tasting. The menu changes seasonally so only the freshest ingredients are used. Began with a watermelon  arugula and feta cheese salad. Beef carpaccio was a hit also. Butternut squash tortellini was wonderful as was the ricotta ravioli. Paul Anthony was a phenomenal waiter.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ambiance was amazing. It was busy so service was good  but not wonderful. I tried the Tiffany cocktail. Being located VERY near Tiffany and Co? I had expectations. They met:) the bread was out of this world. The butternut squash tortellini that I ordered was impeccable!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ok  I really think the overall experience here is sensational.  Fantastic appetizers  wonderful entrees  great wine list  and memorable ambience with the Bellagio fountains.  I've been here twice and thought the place was outstanding in both cases.  We made a slight mis-step with our wine order once  but that was our own doing  not the restaurants.  I think that if you are going to go to a high-end place  like at the Bellagio  this is the restaurant to try.  Update:  went for a 3rd dining experience  and again  it did not disappoint.  Great ambience with the evening Bellagio fountains  great service  and an excellent Mediterranean menu.  I especially liked the Carpaccio appetizer.  Still a top restaurant in my book.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Going in I didn't really expect much since my foodie co-worker scrunched his nose when we told him we had ressies here.  That being said  my expectations were met. Met by a 3 course prix fixe menu consisting of the following:  - a huge duck salad that (while good) was so much food I had to stop halfway before I got completely full - a smattering of not-smoky pancetta atop a sadly not-medium-rare piece of salmon atop a not-good chickpea risotto that was overwhelmingly salty all around - a dry oreo bread pudding that my (out of the box) brownies would put to shame any day  I guess I would have been better off avoiding the set menu. Not impressed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Restaurant Week Lunch!  Buuuuut I got distracted by the Olives burger with Truffle Cheese and Truffle Fries!  Woops lol...at least I was able to sample off it!  To start  the Complimentary bread. Good stuff in here  but it's amazing with the fresh olive spread!  Before coming here  I've never had enjoyable olives...just not my thing I guess  but I enjoyed most of these very much!  Yum :D  First course  Cantaloupe Soup: Almonds and Minted Creme Fraiche. I like cantaloupe  but not really in soup form. Not overly sweet though  just not for me.  Second course  Grilled Skirt Steak: Italian Sausage Mashed Potatoes  Roasted Brussels Sprouts  and Pinot Noir Reduction with Watercress. This was good  but not a very tender cut in the first place. I really enjoyed the mashed potatoes with the sausage inside though!   And for me  Olives Burger ($21): Truffle Cheese  Caramelized Red Onions  and Truffle Fries (+$3). First burger came out MW  sent it back and got a perfect MR. Initial juices pour out front/back  truffle cheese has a tasty bite  and the caramelized onions added a nice crunch! The truffle fries were very good  with lots of truffle oil.  One of the better burgers you will find in Vegas!  And to finish  Coconut Caramel Cake: Chocolate Malt Ice Cream and Coconut Brittle. Yummy! Imagine a coconut macaroon cake with a rich chocolate ice cream on top.  MmmmMmm good :)  We sat outside to enjoy the view and Bellagio fountains  but the fountains weren't working that day! Would have been a great view of them at the patio tables. Loved all the little birds flying around  looking for snacks.  They weren't pestering though  and added a nice touch to the beautiful day.  Service was a little off...soup got served without a spoon.  Waters went empty couple times  and my first burger was overcooked  but overall my experience was good  and the burger and fries were great!  Pics :
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I made reservations for Olives during our recent trip to Las Vegas. The food and atmosphere were fabulous!   We made reservations  so being seated was quick and easy. The decor was beautiful - warm colors and an olive branch motif. An added plus was the bursting fountains right outside the window! My only problem was that the booth I was seated in was too low for the table  so I felt like I was sitting in a hole.   We were quickly served a variety of breads and olives  which were all very delicious (my boyfriend told me it was the best bread he has ever eaten in his life). I ordered the seared beef tenderloin and my boyfriend ordered the rabbit two ways and some wine. Both were presented beautifully. My steak was cooked perfectly and had the softest texture of any steak I have ever had. There was a quail egg and mushroom ravioli on top of the steak  which was very delicious  yet surprising because the quail egg yolk bursts in your mouth. I think my favorite part of the dish was the crispy parsnip chips that were perched on top like a flower! I tasted the rabbit two ways  which was even better than mine. The flavors were very complex  so we left satisfied.  The service was overall good and the waiter was nice  but I must say he was one of the most awkward servers I have had in a long time. He really did not know how to talk to us. When wine was ordered he could barely ask for an ID. We are  21  we look young  you should not be afraid to ask us for our ID  since it's part of the job. He also seemed to give us different service than the older patrons. I might be young  but when I am ordering the most expensive thing on the menu I would appreciate equal treatment.   It was definitely pricey  but I would recommend anyone to splurge!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Todd English is a super nice guy who I had the pleasure of meeting in Scottsdale which makes it really difficult to write this review....  We went to Olives for restaurant week last night and had the 50.09 tasting menu with wine pairings.  http://www.threesquare.org/?p=1447 Krista and I shared each course to make sure we got the full experience.    The only reason this visit got 3 stars (and I am struggling to leave that many!) was because the appetizers and service were worth 4.5.  The rest of the meal was a slim 2 stars.  I know $175 with drinks and wine for a Todd English meal is a deal  I just left feeling like most of the other restaurants on the Three Square list would have done a better job.  The meal felt contrived and uninspired.  It seemed like they chose the easiest items to pre-make  heat and serve.  It could be compared to mediocre wedding fare.  I felt the tasting menu was meant to get you in  but was not a restaurant priority.  Based on this lack of passion  I would not dine here again.  The Meal Breakdown:  Appetizers:  ""Ham n' Cheese"" Arancine - Smoked Mozzarella  Serrano Ham Risotto  w/ Roasted Tomato Soup Excellent - The best part of the meal!  A crisp shell hiding savory ham and cheese topped with one of the best marinara's I have ever had is hard to beat.  I could have these daily and not feel bad about turning into a 500lbs pile of cheese.  Chili Rubbed Black Mission Figs - Gorgonzola Cream  Bacon Bread Crumbs  Rosemary Grissini  Micro Basil Very Good - The combination of figs and sharp cheese is one of my favorites.  The breadsticks on top were  extraneous  but then again I just pushed them aside.  Entrees: Salmon BLT - Boston Bibb Lettuce  Heirloom Tomato  Crispy Bacon Lardon  Toasted Bruschetta  Caper Aioli Good Flavor/ Impossible to eat - The salmon was perfectly prepared and the presentation was beautiful.  Now try to eat it.... All of the ingredients were piled atop the 1/2 inch thick Bruschetta that you needed a mallet to break through.  I gave up on the whole concept and ate the components separately  leaving the bruschetta for the pigeons.  Portobello Picata  Truffle Mashed Potato  Shaved Baby Artichoke Insalata Frisee  Truffle Vinaigrette  Parmesan BLAHHHHH.  It was a pile of boring.  The mashed potatoes were uninspired and the Portobello lacked any flavor.  They reminded me of tempura veggie's from the local sushi joint.  It was dry and not worth the effort of bringing the fork to my mouth.  Desert:  These are not even worth reviewing separately.  My only thought while tasting them was..... Did they get these from the frozen section at Costco?  They were pre-made crap that failed on all levels. The Foster had a stale ""almond cake"" and the Trifle's primary components were J-E-L-L-O and a nabisco cookie.  Almond Banana Foster - Almond Cake  Caramel Rum Sauce  Whipped Cream  Drunk Chocolate Trifle - Dark Chocolate Puddin'  Vanilla Bean Ice Cream  Bailey's White Chocolate Ganache  Double Chocolate Cookie"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Awesome restaurant at Bellagio!!! Came here for lunch hoping to have some foie gras based on the reviews I read  but was told that they only serve it for dinner. While being seated the server told us that the chef was willing to accommodate us and serve us foie gras for lunch. Perfectly prepared and very good foie gras. We also got beef carpaccio which was very fresh and a very large portion. The prosciutto and fig flat bread was also wonderful.The least remarkable but good dish was the squid and octopus. The table we got overlooked the fountains. Great overall service  atmosphere and most importantly food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We have been going to Olives for three years and Jon has always made our experience perfect.  He is a great bartender and his attention to service is appreciated.  He always makes sure our experience is perfect and makes us feel like we are VIPs.  We love Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Stopped into Olives to grab a quick bite before a show.  We were sat at a table between the bar and the door to the patio  which was quite loud and unnecessary seeing as how it wasn't very busy. My husband had the butternut squash tortellini which was good but nothing special. On the other hand I had a veal and prosciutto pasta dish that was SPECTACULAR! Service was excellent  our order was taken and delivered promptly and our waters were never below half full. Impressive wine list. Portions are small for the price but that's to be expected inside a hotel in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My sister arranged a nice birthday dinner for her hubby's 40th here.  She asked for a table with view of the fountains  which we did get  but we ended up with two tables next to each other rather than one table for our whole group.  I think that may have been a misunderstanding on our part  but it was just a little disappointing.  We got over our disappointment pretty quick tough as we started out with delicious drinks and a  fabulous bread/olive tapenade selection.  We had a banquet menu which included tuna tartare or cesear salad apps  salmon  rib eye or chicken entree and a chocolate lave cake for dessert!  Everything was delicious and the view of the Bellagio fountains was a nice compliment to a wonderful meal!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sit outdoors on the patio and have a great dinner with view of the fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had an amazing dinner here  the restaurant has a nice decor  service was awesome! Best part is at the patio seating where u get to view the Bellagio fountains but they don't take reservations for the patio so be prepared to wait. I ordered the Swordfish entree which was just amazing. My wife ordered the Butternut Squash Tortelli which was very good  the filling is quite sweet though. The portions were huge so we had no room left for dessert. Its pricey but hey you're at the Bellagio  in my opinion...it was well worth it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So disappointed they took the only 2 things I order each time I go off the menu   the fried zucchini and the hummus  if they had these items back on the menu is rate them a perfect 5.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I am giving this restaurant 5 stars because of the view from the patio!  If you go here  definitely reserve a patio table if at all possible.  The service was excellent and the food was very good (especially the butternut squash ravioli)  but the best part of the experience was having a unique view of the Bellagio Fountains show.  I was having dinner with 5 guests from Illinois and they were thrilled to watch the fountains during our dinner.   In addition to good food  service and views  the prices also are fairly reasonable.  In fact  if you steer clear of the wine  you will end up spending something close to the price of the Bellagio dinner buffet to eat here.    Highly recommended!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  great ambience  nice views. Make sure you get a seat outdoors so you can watch the Bellagio fountains and the great view of the Eiffel tower--i imagine it's just not the same inside. I got the NY strip steak special ($54) with truffles spinach and foie gras--simply amazing. Medium rare of course. My boyfriend got the salmon ($35) which was also good.  I saw some other reviews about the carpaccio and it definitely was a huge helping and enough for an entree. The drinks are about $14 a piece  but that seems to be standard in Vegas.  This is definitely a must  not only for the food but for the great view of the fountains at night.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was traditional and rather normal. It was missing a uniqueness you would come to expect from a celebrity chef. The appetizers were good as was the bread. The meal itself was so so.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"To be fair  I did not get a chance to try the good at Olives  even though I was looking forward to it.   When I went  I decided to wait at the bar for a friend to meet me. The first hostess rolled her eyes at me and responded with  ""Fine  if you can find a seat."" I was able to take a seat at the bar. The bartender was friendly and the cocktail was excellent.   A few minutes later my friend arrived. I got up from the bar to meet her and realized that both of the hostesses were being extremely rude. They informed her that since I had decided to wait at the bar  they could no longer give us a table. They also said that she could not sit at the bar because it was completely full. Both hostesses seemed incredibly put out and when I tried to speak to the about the situation  they turned away and hold me  ""You should have taken your table when you got here."" I had only been at the bar for 5-10 minutes  and there were several open tables.  My friend and I decided that there were several other places at The Bellagio where we knew the food was excellent  and the staff were MUCH friendlier.   It was disappointing."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I gave this restaurant a 2 stars for many reasons. I came here for my boyfriend's birthday thinking it would be a great experience since its looks romantic sitting next to the Bellagio fountains and eating outside on an August night . We unfortunately were seated inside (which is understandable since the outside was so busy)  but I was the only one who could see the fountains from my seat and my boyfriend barely could get a glimpse of them. I know they can't guarantee a window seat or outside seating but just the fact that they didn't try despite my request that I made with my reservation was frustrating. The service was OK nothing too special. The tables are super close to each other (less than arms length) and it is very noisy. So not romantic! There were 3 different people who had wine glasses fall off their tables and break (seems to be quite the often occurrence). In fact the tables are so close to each other that I got elbowed in the head by the waitress serving the table next to us! I was very disappointed because it was nothing like I pictured it  don't let the dim lighting  candles at every table and the 'view' of the fountains fool you.. it is not a place for a quiet romantic dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you are going to Vegas  go to Olives.  And a day before you go  call and try to reserve a table for dinner on the veranda.  We weren't as thoughtful and reserved a couple hours before we intended on eating  so they seated us indoors- trust me  this didn't take away from the evening due to our amazing waiter!  We started the night with wine and we split a crab cake  which was FRESH and yummy.  Nice a crispy on the outside  and creamy on the inside.  Next  came the entrees...I ordered the almond-crusted swordfish with a lobster vinaigrette and boyfriend ordered the sea scallops.  I nearly died when I had that first bite of swordfish.  Holy Cow.  I was in food-induced shock.  The swordfish ate like a steak  and the layer of almond slivers on top went perfectly with it.  Combine that with a sort of potato salad drenched in this lobster vinaigrette with chunks of lobster meat.  Jesus.  Words can't explain how perfect  it was.  Also- the portion was huge.  More than enough to supplement for the fact that boyfriend's sea scallops were meh.  They were cooked perfectly  but the raisin sauce over it was way too sweet.  We were able to split the swordfish and both be satisfied.  Our waiter came to us several times during the meal was really friendly and extremely courteous.  When he suggested dessert  we were enticed  so we ordered the trio of sorbets.  Our waiter asked if we would like to take dessert on the veranda  and we were more than happy to accept!  On the veranda  we enjoyed coconut  raspberry and mango sorbet in the sweltering vegas heat at ground level of the Bellagio fountains.  A true gem.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Been there many times and had a chance to visit again this week.  Great service  nice beer selection  yummy food.  Only complaint  not a fan of seating so close that you can hear your neighbor's conversation...Overall  a great ""go to"" you can trust to take customers or have a nice dinner with friends."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One reason I would visit Todd English Olives again? CARPACCIO!   Make sure to make reservations in advance. Otherwise  prepare to wait.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Solid... and tasty.  Great experience sitting on the patio with good food  drink  and the Bellagio fountains.  I'm tempted to reduce by one star because Todd English wasn't there for us.  Chef... how could you do that to us?  Ha ha ha.  I've been wanting to eat here for a long time.  And now that we did I am pleased to have had a totally good experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is a lot like a number of fine dining experiences.  Great food  interesting menu  good ambience.  Our waiter was knowledgeable  friendly  and attentive.  Unfortunately  like a lot of other fine dining exeperiences you're finished pretty quickly. Start to finish couldn't have been more than an hour.  It's not like they were pushing us out the door  but things moved very quickly.  It was just the two of us  and only one was drinking  and the total was @$200.  Again  the meal was very good  but for $200 it would have been nicer if the pace was more relaxed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to Olives based on it being listed as a good watching point for the Bellagio fountain and reviews saying it had gluten free options. While it was okay from sort-of-near the windows  to really watch and hear the fountain show absolutely get a table on the outdoor patio. While the staff was generally accommodating of my dietary restrictions  it was not nearly as much as other reviews led me to expect. Perhaps my standards are getting higher as more restaurants become helpful. They did have bread available for me while everyone else had their bread basket  so for once I wasn't sitting there watching them eat. It was a couple slices of toasted sandwich-style white bread  very light and fluffy. It was good with the olive tapenade that came with the bread. There is not a separate gluten free menu or items marked as such on the regular menu. The process is you ask about something and if the server doesn't know they go ask. Helpful  but rather drawn-out. It also wasn't an option to substitute sides  so I ended up with a potato side that had cheese in it that I couldn't really eat. After a while I just settled for something. Their specialties seem to be flatbreads and pre-made pastas so there wasn't great choice. They do have a gluten free pasta option but not as a substitute in their regular pasta dishes  most of which were some kind of stuffed or prepared pasta. The option was to have gluten free pasta with a basic marinara or bolognese which seemed sort of silly to do at such a fancy/expensive restaurant. They have a tablet drink menu  which was more a gimmick than offering anything different. My mom had a very good cocktail with mango in it  and I had one with passion fruit and a sugar rim that was okay but VERY sour. We got the charcuterie platter  very good  with prosciutto  salami  pickled vegetables  cinnamon-dusted walnuts and figs  and three kinds of cow cheese. Substitutions of a goat or sheep cheese weren't available  though our server checked. My mom and I both got the roasted chicken. I don't recommend it. The pesto potatoes were good  though I could only have a taste because they had cheese. The roasted vegetables were okay but rather sparse. The chicken was nothing special and pretty dry. My dad had a veal pasta dish that he proclaimed delicious. The server did his best within what they had available  but it didn't turn out to be a meal worth the high price tag. His efforts are the only thing keeping it above two stars. However  it has the lowest price tag of the seven restaurants listed for fountain-watching  all the rest being listed as $50+. If you're going for the fountain  again  definitely go for the outdoor table even if it's an extra wait.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Setting:  In a mini-mall full of ritzy shops at the Bellagio.  Ambience:  Sucks. Way too dark  way too loud. The patio outside overlooking the water show lagoon looked nice  but like the similar setting at the Paris resort's Mon Ami Gabi directly across the strip  you have to be someone  know someone  or just be lucky to sit there.   Food: Mediocre. The bread was fresh  but like from Vons. The tapenade was too salty. The panzenella salad was VERY good- the best thing we ate  really- a thick slice of toasted bread and cheese  covered with quartered heirloom tomatoes and balsamic dressing. I would seriously consider going back just for that salad  but it was on the daily specials menu  so who knows how often they have it.  The entrees were so-so. My ""flatbread"" (pizza) was bland. Joyce's scallops were tasty  but  they were sitting on a bed of luke-warm  undercooked ""risotto with pancetta""  which had no detectable pancetta in it.  Service: OK- prompt  but at the same time  kinda distacted  if you know what I mean.  No  we didn't order dessert and coffee (hit Red Mango over on Paradise later for that).  We won't be giving this place another chance- too many reliably great choices in Vegas to waste time and money here."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went here for the location.  This restaurant is on the Bellagio lake and looks over the fountains.  You cannot see the fountains though unless you ask for outdoor seating or one of the few window tables.  Escargot was amazing five stars  Sea Bass was a four star.  Ceasar salad was really basic and not worth it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came to Olives for lunch after a big night out  drinking and partying for my sister's bachelorette party.   All of us girls had slept in 'till noon and by the time we arrived to Olives around 2pm  we were starving  thirsty  hung over and craving some good grease food.   We were seated immediately and got lots of water going. We immediately ordered crispy calamari to start and it was devoured.   For our entrees  we ordered a bunch of stuff for the table to share including the organic field greens salad  french fries  butternut squash tortellini and spring pea mezzaluna. Everything was delicious.   The wait staff was friendly and accommodating to our somewhat cranky group of 8 girls.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"If you are looking for a restaurant with a good view of the fountains  you will be greeted with several choices. If you are looking for a restaurant that is  all mild exaggeration aside  basically in the fountains...look no further.  As a Vegas first timer  I definitely wanted to both stare at the fountains Oceans 11 style and have dinner somewhere close so I could see more than one or two shows at a time. Olives was a last minute decision  and  of course  was packed. We were told there would be a 45-60 minute wait  which we were fine with  but we ended up getting a seat on the patio (I highly recommend sitting out there) in less than 5 minutes. Nice start to the evening.  Now on the patio with an excellent view  we were lucky enough to be greeted by Paul - he was the nicest  friendliest  most accommodating waiter we have ever had. He made sure we had great seats throughout the entire meal  which included moving us to a table at the edge (right by the fountains) sometime in between apps and dinner. When we saw the table open up  we thought about asking to move...but Paul came over to tell us that ""Unfortunately  we won't be able to bring your dinner to this table...because now you are both sitting over there!""   The experience was amazing. It was the most relaxed dinner we had in Vegas  and probably one of the most relaxed ones we've had in a really long time  anywhere. Everything was timed perfectly  we never had to ask for anything...it was almost like they read our minds.  In addition to playing musical chairs and watching the fountains  we also ate some really good food. I would recommend the watermelon salad and tuna tartare  but those were hard choices to make (among the many very delicious sounding appetizer options.)  For meals  we had one scallop dish  and one very indecisive panic between the lobster pasta and the ricotta ravioli. I asked Paul what he would recommend out of the two  and he said ""let me surprise you."" I love surprises  so I was down for that. I ended up with a  1/2 portion of each meal  divided by a thin line of balsamic glaze. Both meals were amazing  though if I had to pick one  I'd go for the ravioli.   All in all  we had an amazing dinner  saw at least 5 different shows  and sat as close to them as possible. Paul was a fantastic waiter and the food was delicious  so this place lands a very deserving ""must go"" rating for anyone looking for an incredible dinner in Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Recently had our vacation  so we picked Todd English Olive ' s mainly for the view of Belligio's fountains  reviews were good so reservations were made  but unfortunately we could not get a window seat.  The restaurant is very dark. Their drink menu is lit up  so you can read it  but the menu isn't lit  so needless to say it's very difficult to read. The wait service was very curious and quick  but the food was up to par. We had the tuna tar tar appetizer  ( which was very bland) and the shrimp scampi flatbed ( which was very salty). Dinner consisted of also a very bland Olive's Pescatore  and a Flat iron steak  which was not bad  except for the 2 grilled gulf shrimp that were raw ( well under cooked ). I think since this restaurant mainly serves vacationers. It's a place to avoid  due to the $$$$  and there tons of other places to go. Just look at the fountains from the sidewalk. It's a lot better and closer view!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  and great service. We started at the bar  and my wife ordered a drink off the menu. Turns out she didn't like it  and the bar tender could tell  so he made her another drink and didn't charge her for the first.   At dinner  service was great and food was excellent as well. Like everything in Vegas it was costly  but worth it. I had the New York and my wife had a flat bread. Had the Ahi for an app  and it was just OK. The free olives and tapenade were a nice touch.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,lunch on 1/11 at the bar was awesome as usual----the beef carpaccio is a meal itself  and is the best best best carpaccio I have ever had...its OUTSTANDING and worth the trip here....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a bummer! I was here almost exactly 2 years ago and loved everything about it- sat outside and the service and food was great. I was in last Thursday(super early in the evening with a reservation-5:45) for our 20th wedding anniversary and my birthday weekend. We brought our 12 year old twins. The restaurant knew at the time of the reservation and upon check in that we were celebrating. We had asked at both times to be seated outside. While I understand that they couldn't promise us an outdoor table  they clearly didn't work too hard at it either  we were seated inside. Not only did we not receive a desert or drink or something as most restaurants do for an event as big as a 20th wedding anniversary  not one person even mentioned it! Nothing!  Not even at check in when my husband mentioned it again! What?!?!! The food was not good either. The Greek salad was terrible. My husband's salmon was o.k. I make better every other week for a midweek dinner at home though. My pork was so fatty I barely had anything to eat but bone and fat. The gnocchi  was cold and hard and the pork was really cold. I sent it back which I rarely ever do  and it came back with the same hard cold gnocchi and pork a little warmer. The flavor of the sauce was good. Bread was great(hence the 2 stars)  olives were good. I will never recommend Olives again nor go back. So many good restaurants in Vegas  this one was disappointing on so many levels!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"1. Try to get a seat outside. It's really pretty  especially at night  and you can see the Bellagio water show.  2. The beef carpaccio is amazing. It was my first ""most memorable food experience."" Since then  I've been to Mastro's... so this is probably my second most memorable food experience. It's wonderful. The beef carpaccio here is better than the carpaccio I had in Italy :O They let you order this as an entree too  but it's much more of an appetizer type food in my opinion.  3. Their French fries are pretty awesome too... I love fries so that's a big deal lol  4. I had a braised short rib entree once and it just melted in my mouth. I think I was pretty speechless and silent throughout the course of the meal  which thoroughly shocked my friends because I talk a lot LOL  5. The kebab appetizer is pretty good too! The chicken and beef were both really flavorful. This was a pleasant surprise because I didn't really want to order it  but my boyfriend pulled a coup and ordered it anyways LOL  All in all  I have a soft spot for this place because of 2. It really made me happy after eating here. So ultimately I bumped their 4.5 to a 5 :)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It seems to be that a lot of my favorite restaurants in Vegas converge around the Bellagio Fountain.  I don't see why not.  The Fountain alone is amazing to have as a background of a great meal. Todd English's Olives in Bellagio has class and taste  and won't hurt your wallet.  From the interior design  to the food on the plate  everything was balanced and cohesive -- it all felt like they belonged.  Upon making reservations  I was happy to be seated next to the window facing the fountains.  I asked for the tables outside  but there were none available.  In hind sight  eating inside was a better decision. It was warmer  the decor was nice  and I still sat directly next to the fountain.  Complimentary bread and olives (how fitting) was given before our meal.  The bread varied from chiabata and flat breads  and eating it with the olives was tasty.  It was a bit salty  probably because I used too much  but the taste was very clean and pure. It isn't your normal bread and butter -- that's a good thing.  To go along with our bread  we opted for the Beef carpaccio to compliment our appetizer.  Yes  beef carpaccio is raw beef. Never having it before  and knowing they are known for this dish  I was excited.  The beef was fresh and of high quality  as it should be.  The polenta and gorgonzola  and scallion cream gave it a nice creamy texture.  My favorite was the balsamic reduction.  It was sweet and acidic  which helped break up the richness of the beef. The parmesan  cipolini onions  and garlic aioli rounded out the flavors nicely.  It was a great first experience.  Of course  I love prosciutto.  Salted cured meats?  Fatty and buttery deliciousness?  I am there! Their Fig and Prosciutto flat bread is a must order for sweet and salty lovers.  The fig jam was a bit sweet for me and overpowered the Gorgonzola.  Gorgonzola is a pretty salty and strong cheese -- the rosemary crust and the prosciutto di parma was savory.  Maybe a bit more prosciutto  and a bit less figs would have made this perfect.  The butternut squash tortelli was a great dish as well.  The filling was a mixture of amereto cookie and butternut squash.  A bit sweet  but I guess that is the theme of the meal.  The sage and brown butter  with parmasan cheese made a sweet yet savory sauce. It was a perfect balance of sweet and savory.  The outer layer pasta was freshly made and perfectly cooked.  This was one of their signature dishes as well.  For dessert  we got the truffles.  It came in a trio on top of some of the best caramel I have ever had. One truffle in particular had a dark chocolate  coffee filling that was so rich in flavor.  It was a perfect truffle.  Eating all this good food  watching the fountain show  and enjoying it in the comforts of Todd English's Olives was a pleasure.  Yes  the food had a theme of sweet and savory going on  and we did risk the dangers of eating raw beef  but it was all worth it. All that goodness  and to top it with complimentary dessert truffles was a display of exceptional service. Things like this make me happy. Good food with good people in a restaurant with great food. What more can I ask for?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I've held off on writing this one  but finally decided I needed to put it out there.  Seven of us visited Olives almost four weeks ago for late Saturday night dinner.  Reservations were easy  the host and hostess were able to seat us outside on the patio around 9:45pm for a wonderful view of the fountains. Food was very well prepared and absolutely delicious--I strongly suggest going for the steaks  the meat was a great cut and the medium rare grill was spot-on.  A friend had the flatbread which was very good  and we all shared a really well-paired charcuterie board that got our palates ready for the main course.  If Olives was only about the food  I would strongly suggest you to go and try it.  If only.  The downside here: the service.  Our server  a seemingly nice woman with spiky hair came by to welcome us and take a drink order.  Great.  Drinks then took about 25 minutes to come out.  I should probably mention that there were about 9 tables on the patio  and two servers working them  though out server probably only had three or four including us (the inside of the restaurant was half-full  but other servers were there for that).  Once drinks arrived  a few of them were incorrect and had to be re-done.  One of which was my single scotch which I had ordered with a single ice cube.  Now anywhere in boutique restaurants  a single cube with a scotch (a $20 finger of Oban mind you) means a two-inch solid cube or sphere of ice dropped in the finger of scotch allowing it to mellow the taste and nose of the whiskey.  When the scotch first got to me it was on the rocks (and looked like it had been wallowing in small ice cubes for a good ten or fifteen minutes.  The server saw the look on my face and realized that it was not the way it was ordered and took it back - returning a minute later with the exact  same  scotch (as I could tell by the watered-down color)  with a small tiny cube floating in it  as if it had just been pulled from the commercial ice maker.  Nice to know the servers have no concept of drink prep.  After we all had drinks we were told she would be right back to take food orders.  Just a heads up  ""right back"" at Olives means about 25 minutes again.  Finally ordered the food  waited another 30 for it to come out  and six out of seven of us got served.  Yep  six out of seven  because the server didn't enter in everyone's order.  So the final person in the party got served 10 minutes later.  You might think the server's attitude would be apologetic and humble but no she was icy and blaming everything on the kitchen... funny given that the manager brought out that late dish and said it hadn't been entered...  On the one hand  yes  the other two or three tables seemingly assigned to this server were a bit needy. But if you can't get to most of your guests and you're the server in charge  then you need to ASK FOR HELP - there was another server out there who easily could have jumped in and assisted at different points. But we quickly got the impression that our server was competing with the other  not working in tandem.  If a restaurant is going to be successful  the wait-staff need to work in concert with each other to ensure the guests have a good experience  which is really a failure by both the server and the management.  Otherwise you get comments like this one:  If it's Saturday night in Vegas and you're looking for a place for a late evening dinner--look somewhere else."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I enjoyed my visit to Olives they have some of the best beef carpaccio around (next to N9NE)  and they have some pretty unique vodka en fused drinks. The one thing I would recommend is requesting and waiting for a table on the patio  no it won't make your food taste any better but the view is great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my first time to experience Olives. The wine  appetizers and dinner were amazing! For appetizers and dinner we had the Beef Carpaccio  Portobello flat bread  Seafood Risotto  North Atlantic Sea Scallops  Oklahoma Pork Chops. We had a group of 8 and were seated outdoors  the view was breathtaking! Watching the water show from Olives was such a nice experience. The service was excellent! Tammie was our sommelier; Paul was our server- he provided great recommendations and made our evening such a special experience. Being from Hawaii  Craig came out to check on how we were doing  and also added to our awesome experience.  We finished off our evening with the decadent deserts...Chocolate Falling Cake  and Cookie Butter Creme Brulee. I would definitely make a return to experience this again!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent! We were pleasantly surprised  pork chop was perfectly cooked and presented. My wife had a combo of two pastas and it was just as good. Try to get Ralph as waiter  he may be the best we have ever had in Vegas. We sat outside and although it was a hot evening  it was still very comfortable
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olive's is a fantastic restaurant  exactly what you'd expect from Todd English.  The flavors are somewhat mediteranean and they've got a great menu.  Their cocktails are fabulous  I love their white peach belini and my husband is crazy about their dirty martini with blue cheese stuffed olives.  The bread basked comes with fresh baked onion foccacia and two kinds of olive tapenade.  They have some really good apps  including a great ahi tartare and some really nice flatbreads (one with proscuitto and figs  another with mushrooms  and a great classic tomato-basil-mozarella).  Favs on the dinner menu include the scallops (perfectly seared  served with risotto)  the butternut squash tortellini  and the chestnut ravioli (served on a bed of creamed spinach-heavenly!).  Do not skip dessert here- they have a souflee that is crazy good.  Flavors change but the strawberry is incredible  so is the vanilla.  My husband and I order two  that's how delicious they are.  Service here is always great  very attentive.  I recommend sitting on the patio  it's much more private and has a beautiful view of the Bellagio fountains and water show.  Definitely make reservations or you could be waiting 2 hours for a table.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food and extensive wine list. Have any of the flatbread appetizers. Too full for dessert.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I give one star only because that's the least I could give. We made a reservation for 630 at our table was not ready on time it took them two hours to bring our dinner. The food was not all that. The manager he said I'm sorry. I am not recommending this restaurant at all. You have a lot other nicer choices in Las Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Lucky enough to get a table just strolling by.  Of course  we were dressed up  so that may have helped. In any case I'm not a meat eater but I still found something TE here-the parsnip puree was to die for. My martini was so so so delicious. Service was perfection. We had a lovely table  not on the patio but lovely nonetheless. Other diners were super happy  and my dining partner had a really good looking steak  which she truly enjoyed.  If  and it's a big if  I ever go back to Vegas  I will for sure eat here again  and bring my husband. Maybe :-).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Stayed at the Bellagio and had heard good things about this restaurant so thought we'd give it a try.  We arrived and were told first reservation wasn't open till 9PM but we could sit at the bar and order.  We proceeded to the bar and were immediately attended to and seated by one of the staff.  Very attentive.  We ordered the grilled squid and octopus and Tuna carpaccio.  They were both tasteless.  The octopus was so tough it was not edible and the presentation looked a mess of beans and tentacles. While the Tuna carpaccio was well presented the follow through on taste was a big disappointment.  I would not recommend this restaurant based on my experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Don't schedule a late lunch!  With a reservation at 2:45  we hoped to sit outside since these tables are seated only on a first come first serve basis.  This was the last reservation time of the lunch shift  so there were indeed 2-3 tables open outside to our delight with lots of guests enjoying the view  and beautiful day.  The hostess however said these were reserved  so we were would be inside.  To our dismay  two tables came in afterward and were seated outside to their voiced pleasant surprise.  We were at the tail end of lunch evidenced by the overdressed Greek salad  undercooked pizza and general lack of attention.  The waiter was nice and apologized for the obvious pool of salad.  I had high hopes for Olives and sadly  it disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food  the service the atmosphere  the cocktails are wonderful at Olives. Always a fun  memorable time when dining at Olives. Sitting on the Patio watching the watershow is awesome. One of our favorites
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The very best of Las Vegas! The food  the ambiance  the staff. PERFECTION! Ask for Paul (the guy who looks like Steve Harvey). He was the best waiter in the place. You cannot go wrong at Olives. Special occasion or just a romantic dinner. You won't regret it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We walked up without a reservation and we were given ( by sheer luck  I'd say) the best table in the house- outside with a beautiful view of the Bellagio Fountains. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious. Very romantic! We visited another time and sat inside. The experience was not close to the same. You must sit outside to really experience Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's raviolis were okay but are over price  their margaritas suck ! Water down junk  didn't think this place was special. Took forever for the waitress to come to our table right now took forever get are  drinks. My sister salad was good Boston bib salad.  seem not to care about working there and suck .
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great service  great food  great view of the Bellagio fountain... no more need be said!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"It is our favorite  ""Must Go To"" spot when we are in Vegas. The mushroom flat bread and the infused vodka martinis are always my favorite! The view of the fountains are gorgeous! Olives is a Vegas Gem and Hot Spot! While the hostesses sometimes are not the best  it is worth enduring for the experience! If you don't have a reso  try and sneak in on the bar...the bartenders are always great! Olives is just wonderful!!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great ambiance and food. Good choices. Enough fish and vegetables for our tastes. Sit on the balcony to watch the astounding fountain shows. A real treat for special events.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ok- we rarely review places but lately I am stepping up and doing my yelp reviews! which means you were probably really good (which this was) or really bad (which that was NOT!!!) Ummm... just ask your server what to get if you're not familiar with the more mediterranean cuisine... I literally had our server order for the table and nobody had a dish they didn't like.  Beef  pasta  seafood everything was GREAT!!!!! It was a couple months ago so I don't remember what all we ordered  but all was amazing.  ONLY complaint is that there was a wait but that's too be expected I suppose.  NOT enough to bring it down from 5 stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We go to Olives every time we're in Vegas. Their beef carpaccio is amazing & try the Tiffany Martini. We enjoy sitting at the bar  never wait for a table. Our favorite bartenders are Chris  Ernie  Zach and Raul.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I LOVE this restaurant.  I always visit it when I'm in town.  The Hostess is always fantastic and very accomodating.  I love the elegance of this restaurant  the seating on the patio  the views of the incredible fountains   very romantic  the menu is divine.  (Love the free range chicken.)  This is definitely one of my absolute favorite restaurants in Vegas.  Ciao Bellas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Me and my wife want there for  Celebrating anniversary.  The food was in the table in 15-20 min  And the taste was beyond expectation Love this restaurant for good !  I would recommend it to everyone I know.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love olives....green  black  in my martini  with stuffed cheese  however you do it i'll eat 'em. Great Service Beautiful view of the water show in front of the Bellagio Not too pricey for Vegas Big portions  I can't complain.  We ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread and caprese salad as appetizers.  The flatbread was a bit too sweet for me  but the others really liked it. The caprese salad had the yummiest mozzarella...i cant recall the name of the mozzarella. Entrees ordered: ricotta ravioli  butternut squash tortelli  and the oven roasted chicken...we were all very satisfied when we left.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is wonderful.  A perfect view of the fountain show.. I had a scrumptious shrimp and wild rice dish that was light and just yummy. Very nice and the view of the fountain was the best!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had an amazing dinner at Olives at the Bellagio a couple weeks ago. Had a 5pm reservation but couldn't get a patio seat until 7. Decided to wait until 7 and just walk around and gamble until then. WORTH IT! Our table was amazing and the view was spectacular. Everything about the night was amazing. Sat and drank after dinner and watched the show without feeling rushed to leave. By far one of the best experiences I've had in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was amazing. I felt that the price was well worth the quality of the food. The service was spot on  and the scallops I ordered were the best i ever had.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this place! The portions are large  reasonable price (for Vegas). I didn't have a reservation so I opted for the bar where they serve the full menu. Great service! I had the fiery chicken flatbread  It was definitely enough to share... The complimentary bread and tapenade are amazing! This place is a must if you like American/Meditterranean fine dining at a reasonable price.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Everything started out great - we made our lunch reservation on line and the table was ready for us.  We ordered a number of dishes and shared them between us. So we had a lengthy long lunch. Staff was just great  will be back there soon to enjoy the good food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best scallop meals of my life here. Per a recommendation from the server  who said it was the best thing on the menu.   Our table of 10 had no problem getting all food and drinks out in a timely manner. Every table gets olives and different breads that are each flavorful and delicious.   Even from our table near the front of the restaurant  you could see the fountains outside. Enjoy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was OK and the service was very professional and friendly  but I came here primarily for the view of the hotel's fountain show for my 10 & 5 year olds.  If you want a better view  you should make reservations at the hotel's other restaurants that have more panoramic views of the fountains. After dinner  you should check out the hotel's butterfly garden and then go order some gelatos/pastries (it's right next to the garden with the giant chocolate syrup fountain).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Maybe it's the Vegas's tradition  but the bread platter they serve here along with more other restaurants is exquisite. There's the crispy thin breads  warm oliveoil-rosemary rolls  etc etc. Comes along with a dish of olive tapenade. YUM. It's my fault I kept munching on my bread when the rest of my food came  my stomach's 50% full.  Started off with the sweet potato apple soup drizzled with balsamic and topped with thinly sliced scallion. Surprising and unexpectedly sweet  very tasty  of course  but wouldn't have ordered that unless it's dessert. Entree was crispy portobello burger served with side of steak fries. YUM. Vegetarian option. Always loved burger  but gotta find one without the beef. Hard. But not at Todd English's. The burger was HUGE. The bun is spongey and sweet  just like potato bread. The steak fries is battered marinated in perhaps a cheddar or something salty. This place is by far the better (and more reasonably-priced menu in the strip) compared to the rest of the restaurants I tried there. Also lllooovvee the outdoor patio overlooking the Bellagio Fountain show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had this server named Nelson and he was so wonderful. He brought us yummy food and he was nice to us even though my friend and I were kinda drunk and acting like idiots. Ask for Nelson and tip him well  he's the man.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was tasty and beautifully presented. We had a table of 8 and our tab was over $1500. I do not mind the money but the service is garbage. 35 minutes for cocktails and they came back too rarely. I am sure it was an anomaly as the service was better on prior visits.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I am SO glad we listened to a friend and had dinner here. Food was fabulous and view was amazing.  Suggest reservation and request garden seating so you can see the Bellagio water show. They say garden seating is first come first seated. We made 5pm reservation because we had show tickets and got there about 20 minutes early. Pair this evening with Cirque ""O"" and it's a perfect night.   Will DEFINITELY recommend to everyone and visit again."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Stayed at Bellagio for the weekend with a group of old friends for my bachelorette party.  Ate a delicious lunch here one day with my best friend.  We shared the tuna carpaccio (we almost licked the plate clean it was so friggin' good)  then I enjoyed the fig and proscuitto flatbread and she had a salad and substituted salmon for chicken.  My flatbread was OK.  Her salad came out with two huge salmon filets.  We both only ate about half of our main course.  Wine selection was awesome.  I wasn't loving our server but the manager  hostess  and everyone else seemed very attentive and pleasant.  Ambience was great  and we were seated by the window with a gorgeous view of the famous fountain.  I would definitely eat here again - wanted to return for dinner but we had reservations elsewhere!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We ate here last night. It was a good experience. It was just TWO of us and our bill was $126.00. Before tip. At first we went to the bar and had one drink each that was 31.00.  We closed the bar tab and went to table outside on patio. For dinner we had only entrees and no apps. 2 glasses of wine each (4). I had the roasted chicken. I could not eat it all due to the bone. Servings are Very Small. We were still hungry after our meal. He had the scallops. Which came with nothing (no potato  no side included) and they were $42. Our server was excellent. The view is why we came. We had a great time. Loved watching the fountain while eating. But won't be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best restaurants we've ever been to! the food was beyond expectation and the service was great with beautiful view of the fountains! highly recommended! wish we had one in our home town in San Diego!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Way too over-rated. 20mn wait despite reservation. Service was all about speed  we felt like we had to be out of there asap. Food was very average. Tartare was dry  papardelle overcooked... No savor. Very bad value for money  definitely not worth $240 for 2. Our only disappointing experience all week-end in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"OK  so a restaurant that is perched on the fountain at the Bellagio automatically gets 2 stars; they could have a horrible staff and only serve cow manure and it would get a two.. I mean just plug your nose  sit quiet  and watch the fountain. That being said  despite the obvious benefits of the setting  I wasn't incredibly impressed with this place  especially given that the bar for dining is a little higher in Vegas in general. Don't get me wrong  it was good food  good service  and I have no big complaints... it just didn't WOW me - and who isn't looking to get ""wow'ed"" in Sin City? With so many amazing places to go in this town  it may be hard to get me to come back here. I would recommend to a Vegas first timer who wants to picture themselves sitting next to Danny Ocean by the fountain after pulling off that big heist - it's a very ""Vegas"" experience that everyone should have. Not sure I would recommend if you can't get a spot on the patio  though - in that case you're just in a pretty good but pricey Italian restaurant and may as well be in Pittsburgh.   Only actual complaint was they couldn't get the speaker volume right on the patio  they must have turned it up then down 5 times in the course of the meal per people's complaints/requests."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My girlfriend and I went here on our last night in Vegas to have a nice 'expensive' dinner - a little splurge for our last night.  Well  it was TOTALLY worth it - and not all that high priced  either.  The first  most important thing you MUST do is wait for a table on the outside patio - if weather permits.  You get an up-front view of the fountains  which are breathtaking at night.  Next thing you need to do is NOT worry about the money - you're going to be spending at least $150 per couple if you want to enjoy yourselves - after all  this IS Vegas people.  The scallop dinner over sweet corn risotto was the absolute BEST scallops I have ever had  and quite possibly the best seafood I've ever had.  The risotto was absolutely delicious!!  If there weren't so many other restaurants in Vegas  I would definitely be going here each and every time - but then  I would miss so much more out there.  But this is definitely something you must try once!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was good  Scenery is fantastic (Bellagio Water Show)  Decor is elegant. Drinks we're good AND strong. I felt for the price the food could've been more flavorful and appetizing  but it definitely isn't bad  I just had high expectations. But Overall  I enjoyed my evening here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I dropped in here and sat at the bar for a quick bite to eat and a drink. Being completely transparent  all I have base my experience off of was a plate of fried calamari and a bloody mary.  The calamari was 4-star status. The portion was fair for the price  and tasty as all get-out. It was fried perfectly - crispy  tender  and not greasy.  The bloody mary was only 2-star status  and so was the sevice. When I ordered the bloody mary  I asked for no rim. The guy gave me a look and said  ""We don't put anything on our bloody marys"". Well sorrryyyy. And they weren't kidding. No rim  no celery  nor lime. Just a green olive.  Looking at other people's plates  the food looked really good and they all looked happy. Alas  I can only rate based on my experience. Mediocre service +  meh bloody mary + awesome calamari = 3 stars."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The girlfriend and I came in a few nights ago for a romantic dinner on the balcony. We spent about two hours there. 30 minutes into it the gas in the heater ran out. management kept on giving me the runaround about putting a new tank in. The patio is 42 degrees at night. The rest of my vacation I spent with a cold that is now bronchitis. The food was absolutely phenomenal. Extremely disappointed in the staff and expressions and management.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I would recommend making reservations waaay in advance to sit outside for dinner  or make reservations the day before to sit outside for lunch. Hanging out in the patio while the fountains do their thing is quite a site. The service was pretty good and the food was delicious. We had a bibb lettuce salad and shared a mushroom flat bread. The presentation of the salad was really nice and the dressing on it was light and tasty. The flat bread was also really great tasting. Oh....make sure to order the blueberry sour. Yummers! Drink slowly though :)  Do expect to pay a little more than your average lunch place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate their tonight and was pleasantly surprised.  Everything was scrumptious.  Even the plain green salad had an amazing vinaigrette. Kudos to the chef.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a lovely birthday dinner here with my husband and friends.  We made reservations for 7pm.  Seated right away.  Sometimes at fancier restaurants you aren't seated immediately even though you have reservations.  They brought us out to the patio that overlooked the fountains. It was great to see the dancing fountains throughout dinner.  What a fantastic place for dinner!  Even though it was July  the sun was just going down and it was pretty comfortable outside.    I know I usually don't dine at places like this except for special occasions  but they brought out the drink menu on an iPad!  I was impressed.  You just tap on the mixed drink and it would tell you what the ingredients were.  It was great to see technology making it's way into menus.  (Plus I love apple products)  We ordered from the Prix Fixe menu.  This runs $55 per person and $20 more if you'd like the wine paring.  I started with the grilled shrimp skewers and pineapple salad.  Absolutely delightful!  The salad was so light and refreshing.  The shrimp had a fabulous flavor that definitely hit the spot!  My entree was the gilled Alaskan Halibut over mushrooms with fennel potatoes.  OH MY GOSH!  Very delicious! So far my bday dinner was perfect!  For dessert I had the pineapple lime cake with coconut ice cream.  Not too sweet and very light cake.  A great treat for the end of my meal...  or so I thought!  For my birthday they brought out 4 cream puffs drizzled in chocolate with Happy Birthday written on the plate.  They were incredible!  And yes I shared...  :-)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were very excited to try his Vegas place.. Boy what a big let down!  Did not get anything that was impressive what so ever! Not going there again! Over!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food  great service that didn't feel snobby  beautiful atmosphere. Worth it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Oysters are always hood but whatever they put on it was very hard to eat. A raw onion with a lot of vinegar. I prefer to put extras by myself. My husband ordered a monkfish with mashed root vegetables - it was amazing. I ordered ribeye with broccoli flowers. The steak was over done and I ordered it medium rare. I had flowers underneath my steak and steams on top. Plus the steak was covered with sweet onion jam. I couldn't taste the meat at all.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We just had dinner at Olives. The food was superb. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. A great experience
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for a wedding luncheon and everyone loved the food.  Some of the dishes seemed to be hit or miss though.  The beet salad needed a little less dressing  the side salads were huge (too much dressing on these as well) the bean soup was DELICIOUS. The salmon was PERFECT  the pasta bolognese had a strange lingering cinnamon finish  and the tuna tartare with creme fresh was good too. Was not a huge fan of the potatoes in this dish - seemed like an odd combination.    Attentive staff  good wine  all around not too pricey considering.  Date Rating: 8 Pick up Scale: 1  Strong Suggestion: Have the salmon and the bean soup.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I first heard of this place many years ago after that atrocious Iron Chef USA pilot showing Todd English (Captain Kirk is no Chairman!).  The ambiance is dark and intimate  and if you're lucky you can sit on the outside under heated lames next to the Bellagio Fountain Show.  Overall I think it's a solid three stars. Service was excellent throughout  but I think the style of the dishes tended to be a bit too salty for us and doesn't quite fit our palate.  - The free bread comes with two types of tapenade and pickled olives.  So you get elements of salty and briny early.  - For Appetizers we got the squid and octopus in a brown sauce with chickpeas.  The sauce was actually very good and balanced and went well with bread.  Octopus and squid both very tender - definitely share with two people!  - Wife got the diver scallops which came four large per order - seared on one side  well seasoned and juicy.  Perfectly cooked.  The sauce (vinaigrette ?) made it a bit too salty however.  Truffle mash was decent.  - I got their mushroom pasta  which came with like four types of mushroom with pappardelle pasta cooked al dente.  Flavors were good   but I think it went overboard with the Parmesan.  A bit too much cream too.  - Dessert we shared a pumpkin torte that was just outstanding - it had pumpkin chips  to add texture and zing and layers of sweet and spice just like pumpkin should be.  The cake layer was thin and the whole dish was airy.  It went really well with their black coffee.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love coming here and sitting outside with an iced tea in my hand watching the fountains dance to the music.  So romantic and relaxing.  The food here is a bit pricy but worth it.  I've had the soft shell sandwich here  OMG!!!  I was in heaven.  The crab was crispy with a lot of crab taste.  MMMM  The service is average.    Come for the ambiance.  You can't get a better view of the Fountains than here!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives is located in the Bellagio so walking there already makes you feel fancy. We made reservations for 10pm on a Saturday night and was seated promptly and even was able to request patio dining with the best view of the bellagio water show. The waiter was nice although he didn't check on us as much as other nice fancy restaurant servers do. There was a variety of complementary bread including sweet bread  hard toasted bread  and a soft loaf. The spread is none other than olive spread 3 ways; green olives  black olives  and whole olives in the middle. We ordered a mozzarella flatbread for an appetizer  which I could have done without because the bread is already fulfilling. The flatbread was just a fancy pizza and was not worth the $17  although it did make for good leftovers.   I ordered Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with shrimp scampi risotto  toasted garlic chips  crispy pasta  micro green insalata  & aged balsamic vinaigrette. The sea bass tasted like butter and the garlic chips gave it a nice added taste. There was also mashed potato underneath the beautiful presentation. My boyfriend had the Veal Agnolotti Al Plin with slow braised osso buco  fontina cheese agnolotti  and truffle butter. Delicious! The veal was so tender and complimented the sauce and pasta really well. I suggest both dishes! Both tasted great with riesling white wine. Expensive but tasty! The portions were also a good size enough to eat in one sitting but not too small where you're not fulfilled.    The best part of the whole experience was the environment. You can't beat front row seats to the water show with the likes of  Frank Sinatra and Celine Dion accompanying the show. My favorite water show was with the song ""Time to Say Goodbye"" by Sarah Brightman and Andrea Bocelli. Very romantic. Looking for a date spot or a girls night out  this is a great place. I would recommend going at night to fully enjoy the beauty it has to offer.   Pros: online reservations  prompt seating  beautiful view. Cons: patio dining request once you arrive only so it's not guaranteed and it is very pricey  but a beautiful place to check out at least once! So save up  dress nice  and enjoy the view."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I thought that this place was great.  Great service  I loved my food.  Overall I was very happy - my only concern was it was a bit pricey (about $44 for two people for lunch) but I guess that's to be expected.  It's Vegas  baby.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"You can't skip out on a vegas trip without fine dining  and Olives is a prettyyyy good place to get that fine dining experience.  There's also plenty of seating with the view of the water show.  This place isn't just Mediterranean  but they also offer steaks and pastas!  The onion bread and sesame crisps were a good start.  They were both flavorful but the bread was so salty that I had to down my water after.  The tapenade was great and very interesting (my first time trying it) but it was on the saltier side as well so I couldn't get myself to add more salt to my bread...  All the appetizers seem like they can be eaten as a light meal. I had the tuna tartare and it was stuffed with so much tuna!  The cucumber salad on the bottom of it was so refreshing and the shrimp inside was tasty as well.  The gnocci was a little softer than I expected and the ""duck breast"" tasted like ham.  I like ham and all  but duck is my favorite meat and when I order duck  I expect duck.  I'm a little sad that I missed out on the carpaccio which has great reviews  and fig flatbread (because I loooove fig jam and fig on flatbreads) so I am definitely going back for that."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Everything about this place is 5 star. The fountains the  the food. Specially the t bone steak!  Off the charts!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is really pretty amazing.  I had the Foie gras appetizer and the duck confit pasta and both were amazing.  Watching the fountain during dinner was just an added plus.  I would recommend you get reservations and ask for a window with a good view.  I actually didnt have a reservation  they initially said 30 min but they actually sat us in 5. The bread with the  olive tapenade to start is also pretty stellar.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Even when holding Olives (in Bellagio) to my Manhattan standards in terms of creativity  innovation and quality  everything about this Sin City gem was simply exquisite  from decor to service to food/drinks.  Prices are certainly inflated  but that's par for the course in Vegas. Two drinks  appetizer and entree came to $125/person after tax and tip. Thank god for expense accounts!  I ordered the Chilean Seabass and the waiter told me I chose the best entree on the menu. I guess I have a knack for eliciting that response haha. The miso glaze was a bit salty  but all-in-all I loved the dish.  And the tuna tartar to start (suggested by the waiter) wrapped in a bed of shaved cucumber was divine.  My co-workers got the lobster pasta dish  bib salad and calamari/octopus starters. Everyone was more than content.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food and service.  Try the beef cappacio and seafood risotto.  This is one of the best restauants on the LV strip.  Prices are not cheap  but you get what you pay for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,View is pretty good outside  but still need to stand up to see the show unless you are one of four two person tables at the edge. A good place for a pic though. Food is expensive and mediocre. Probably better just to watch the fountain show out in the front.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Let me start by saying the Bread basket was the highlight of the evening. The chocolate bread was so yummy! Other than that I can't say that anything really stood out for me. I had the Lobster Carbonara which was good  but wouldn't draw me back to the restaurant. My friend had the short rib lasagne and enjoyed it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Solid. Even though we were staying IN the Bellagio  we still totally got lost and showed up late for our reservation (past the grace period).  They still seated us without too much fuss. Unless you are vegetarian or have some other legit reason  you MUST get the beef carpaccio.  It is to die for  and was a great size to split for 4 people.  I also had the lamb lollipop entree  and it was great. On the pricey side  but hey it's Vegas  and the food does not disappoint.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Another meal with the vegetarians yielded a delicious flat bread/pizza with morels (bacon on the side!) and a butternut squash ravioli.  Excellent access to the outdoors with the patio  giving one those views of the Bellagio fountains.  A much more casual restaurant than Picasso  but a nice respite from the clack-and-clang of it all.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The Flatbread was burnt; I really cannot believe the waiter served it.  The Beef Tartar was good  but served on top of cold mashed potatoes (gross  I had to scrape it off to enjoy).  I ordered beef tenderloin rare  but was served medium and was tasteless.  The caramel and pear creme brulee  was too many flavors  but after scraping off the fruit it was much better.  On the good side  the Beef Carpaccio was awesome. I might go back for a nice wine and Beef Carpaccio on the patio  but there are so many other great places here in Vegas I am not sure.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Braised wild boar pappardelle was hearty rich and delicious minus two flaws: 1) Cippolini onions were inedible  and 2) some of the pappardelle was stuck together and therefor a little raw in places. Expected more than plain olives for the amuse bouche - at least marinate them. Beautiful decor  especially nice mosaic floor. Service was quick.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not the best meal - so many other offerings in Vegas! Staff was great. Alaskan halibut was tender an a bit dry. The $55 meal deal is the way to go for most bang for your bank.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good food. I had the Atlantic Salmon that was cooked perfectly. My husband had the Sea Scallops that he liked as well. We had an awesome Australian wine and for dessert the banana Tiramisu  which was delicious. The service was spot on.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Yes  it was hard to get seated  so we sat at the bar  which was fine.  The bartenders are great and we got really good info on places to go to and places to avoid.  They didn't steer us wrong.  The food was great and the atmosphere was great.  we will go back next time in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Loved this place  hitting it up for lunch was probably the best idea we had all weekend as far as food goes.  It's pretty classy looking but you won't feel too out of place with jeans and a t-shirt (although I was amused with the people dressed more than business casual with young kids in tow dressed as young kids tend to dress - I'm sure that's their normal weekend getup and I am nowhere near that fancy).  Reservations are recommended but we got a table for 2 right away at around 1:00 PM.    I really really wanted to try out some appetizers but we skipped them because we knew there wouldn't be room.  The flatbreads that other tables had were looking really tasty.  If I go back  I'd be willing to just go all appetizers for a meal  pick a little bit here and a little bit there  but that's for another trip.    The wine list is extensive (the Bellagio boasts thousands of wines and tens of thousands of bottles  so it was expected but still impressive to see).  The cocktail list is full of the usual trends these days  which wasn't appetizing to me (although I did get some simple cocktail with cognac  cointreau  ginger ale  and some other things which was pretty good).  They had a very tasty sangria that had the perfect amount of brandy.    They give you table bread at the beginning  which was really good.  There was some onion bread  normal bread  and sesame seed cracker things and it was served with some green olive tapenade  black olive tapenade  and a few special olives outside of your normal black and greens.  Really tasty  although in my mind it's very hard to go wrong with bread and olive tapenade.   My meal was the chicken and vegetable lasagna.  It came out in a cylinder  like a lasagna stack or something  and was more like a mix of lasagna ingredients all swirled together than your traditional layered lasagna.  Cream sauce too  instead of tomato-based.  It was awesome.  There was a lot of chicken in big chunks  lots of perfectly done pasta  and all of the veggies gave it a healthy spin.  Nothing was overpowering  proportions were spot-on  and it was overall deliciously tasty.  I got to try the ricotta ravioli  which was also awesome.  The Italian sausage inside had the perfect spicy kick that let you know it was there without needing to search for it and without being too spicy.  The red sauce with that was a good complement.  The price was high  like all of Vegas and especially the Bellagio  but it didn't feel out of place here.  You got what you paid for and you'd be hard-pressed to find the equivalent meal for a lower price anywhere else in the US.   The service was pretty good.  The waitress had a look to her like she was already looking forward to the end of her shift but was still attentive and nice.  Finally  after writing this review  I miss my meal and I would like to go back for some more...like  now!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,LOVE LOVE LOVE olives! came here first time for my 20th birthday then came back for my 22nd birthday for dinner. Great place to grab a ribeye. I also ordered the lobster here given i love lobster diablo and since the closure of Joe Dimagizzos in sf i havent found another place that makes it just as good. sadly after eating at CUT the night before this lobster had no chance of shining since all i could think and compare it to the lobster at CUT. I had the ribeye of course. So good unfortunately its in vegas and im in sf. we had pretty yummy drinks but i cant recall the name =[ BOO! i love that they have olive bread. the flatbread pizza is to die for. OMG FIG and PROSCIUTTO could there be a better combo than that. Cant wait to return eating here hopefully it will be soon! =D For a group of 5 girls the bill came out to be 100 a person  not too bad.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Simply amazing tapenade  a view to a kill  scrumptious scampi flat-bread  sexy interior and some of the best monkfish with scallop risotto I have ever put in my mouth.  Todd English is a little marketed and less known restaurant on the Vegas strip but is well worth the visit.  Great for a lingering dinner before O.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was really delicious and I loved seeing the water show a couple times throughout dinner. The bread and olive dip is amazing.. I ate way too much of that before my dinner came out! I enjoyed the pear goat cheese salad with a few ladies  it was very delicious! I had the chicken gnocchi for dinner  which was also great! Definitely recommend Olive for dinner with friends or for a date night.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I living in LA.every time i come to vegas this is my ""must to go""restaurant.the ""beef tartare""and""beef  carpaccio""and""Foie Gras""also is in my ""must order list""Nice restaurant nice services and great food!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing restaurant with probably the best view of Belaggio fountains. Food was awesome and the service was great. Definitely worth and recommend this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was delicious. We had scallops and steak  they were cooked right  tasted good. Quit expensive but i think the serving is plenty. We didnt order any starters yet we were stuffed. The olives dipping for the bread were good  not that sour.   They were pretty busy but timing was right  we didn't have to wait that long for the service.   I would definitely come back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I went last year in December and thought the food was just okay. I ordered the Grilled Squid and Octopus  House-made Gnocchi  and Sea Scallops. My auntie  loved it since it was her first time having grilled octopus  but this is maybe my 4th time or so and I had a much better experience elsewhere. I also ordered a glass of chardonnay. By itself the chardonnay was mediocre  but with complimentary olives on the table  it was yummy. I thought it was pricey for the quality of the food and drinks. If it was not for the wonderful patio view of the strip  I probably would not come back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,VERY delicious food. Beautiful atmosphere and classy. Ordered the duck gnocchi and was amazing. Flavorful and unique. Had a glass of port for dessert which had a lil unpleasant grape bits like it was the end of the bottle. Wish I sent it back but we had a show to catch.   Overall my friends and I had a enjoyable evening at Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"extending the OLIVES branch.  During our recent Vegas trip  my family and I dined here after watching a performance of ""O"".  We chose Olives mainly because of its convenience  as we wanted to dine at a restaurant located within the Bellagio property following the show.    LOCATION: Bellagio Hotel in the area with the luxury goods shops.    CHECK-IN:  I made a reservation online for 915pm.  We showed up a bit early  perhaps 15-20 minutes  and therefore I asked if there was a chance we could be seated.  Unfortunately  the hostess informed us that the tables weren't turning around as quickly as they had hoped due to the inclement weather closing the patio seating.    We all decided to pass the extra wait time at the bar  of course.  The bartender  ironically  had lived for a few years in Kona.  And for some reason  knowing that Hawaii connection put us at ease and the time passed quickly as we had a few drinks and shared some laughs.  The hostess came to gather us from the bar and showed us to our table as soon as it became available.     FOOD:  Menu offerings are extensive.  To start we decided to share the salmon flatbread and the beef carpaccio (thanks to a recommendation by our server).  For our main entrees  I chose the gnocchi  my mother selected the salmon  and my brother the pork chop.    Firstly  the appetizers were delicious  and extremely filling as the portions are huge.  Really  they were.  Both the flatbread and carpaccio could have easily been an entree all by itself.  I surmise that we thought our appetites were more ravenous than they actually were.  We did our best to make a dent in the flatbread and carpaccio  and though each was delicious in its own right  we didn't want to stuff ourselves prematurely.  I would make a strong recommendation for either these appetizers.  The entrees were also generous portions.  The gnocchi was simply delectable  and I wish I could have eaten every morsel of my entree.  All the components of the dish including the gnocchi  smoked duck breast  and corn and leek puree  combined to create an outstanding dish.  I managed to eat about half of my dinner before I called it quits.  It was incredibly good.  My brother and mom enjoyed their entrees as well.  As they were nearing the full capacity of their bellies  they manged to eat all of the salmon and pork chop  respectively  before finally setting down their fork and knife.  Needless to say  we all were very satisfied with our food.  SERVICE:  Extremely attentive.  Our server was a friendly gentlemen who not only was patient  but was also helpful in recommending appetizers and drinks.  He answered all our questions about the menu  and checked on us periodically throughout the meal.  Excellent customer service overall.  BOTTOM LINE:  A very delicious and memorable meal at Olives.  Bring your appetites  or a lot of people  if choosing to share an appetizer.  The portions are generous.  Delicious food and quality service made this dinner quite unforgettable."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the best restaurant of our entire post-Labor Day stay!  Try the Expresso Martini - well worth the money.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hmmm. Why did our waiter have zero fine dining experience? He actually bussed our plates while stacking them in front of us on the table and grabbed the end of my cesar salad salad wegde (located on the bottom plate) and threw it on top of the stack of plates so he could carry them. He then marked for next course before we were done with the first and forgot forks which is sort of important if you want to eat. Food was decent.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Bad host  great bar  awesome waiters  and incredible view!!! Food was very good. I got the seat outside  fountain view. It was great experience in Las Vegas. However  I was waiting for 2 hours to get that seat even I reserved and shown up early. So stupid! But worth it. Big thanks to the waiter  he finally moved us to the edge of patio. It is the best!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place does impress. The flatbread is amazing   by the time you finish with appetizers you won't want your main meal. Make room! It is worth it the halibut is a must!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My party arrived in Vegas a bit later than expected.  Olive's was very accommodating and our party of three still seated promptly upon our almost hour late arrival (we did call to let them know ahead of time). My party split a bottle of the Malbec (the only Malbec also sold by the glass). It was quite tasty and complimented our meal nicely. First  we enjoyed the oyster appetizer. It was unique  delicious and a generous portion (6 oysters). Next  we enjoyed the beef carpaccio. Again  very unique  delicious and a hearty portion! By the time our third course arrived  the chicken flatbread  we were all stuffed! We still enjoyed a taste of the flatbread but took the rest to go. Aside from food and drinks  the service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere was excellent. We were seated front row for the water show outside of the Bellagio. I will be back and recommend this place to anyone looking for Mediterranean inspired cuisine!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great location and outdoor seating was worth the wait.  The food was not! The scallops were done well  but not cleaned very well as they had sand in them. I ordered gnocchi which came raw. The pasta was raw and still stuck together. They replaced it with an order of ravioli. Unfortunately the pasta cook must have been new because these came out raw in the centers. Not worth the price.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"On a recent trip to Vegas my husband and I wanted to treat ourselves to one really nice dinner and decided on Olives.  We specifically wanted to eat outside on the patio overlooking the fountains  but unfortunately you cannot reserve a table there - you must request at check in.  We made a reservation for 8pm and arrived a few minutes early to request a table outside.  We were told we could come back at 9pm and sit outside  so we did.   We were seated all the way at the back of the patio  which has a very obscured view of the fountains because of large overhead umbrellas  but we still enjoyed the ambiance (fountain shows every 15 minutes).  We did not  however  enjoy the service.  Our waiter seemed very frazzled and like he had too many tables.  Also  when we first arrived someone had spilled a drink on a neighboring tables Prada purse - cleaning up the purse and then sucking up to that table seemed to be a priority for the rest of the night.  Our waiter did not greet us or welcome us at all  his opening line was ""can I get you a cocktail?""  We really expected more from what is supposed to be a fine dining restaurant.  We heard ""I'll be right back"" three times from our waiter before he *finally* took our order 25 minutes after we sat down.  We were not even brought bread until after our order was taken  30 minutes later.  After waiting so long to simply order our food  we were really frustrated and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager did not offer any apology or explanation at all  he basically thanked us for letting him know.  I order Todd's Caesar Salad ($15) as a starter  nothing special.  My husband ordered the grilled squid and octopus ($16)  which he said was just okay.  For entrees I had the Brick Oven Roasted Free Range Chicken ($29)  again  nothing special - the best part was the grilled onions.  My husband had the Duck Two Ways ($34) which he thought was just okay as well.  We skipped dessert - though after we refused twice and turned down coffee and cocktails  the waiter tried to entice us with ""it's on me"" to make up for the bad service  but we declined.  Nothing was taken off our bill.  Overall  the food was average  and the service was really terrible.  The ambiance was romantic  though sitting closer to the water would have been much nicer to see the fountains clearly (though you will be misted!)."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I find that Yelp is great for 2 things: finding out about great restaurants that you should try and avoiding terrible restaurants you should avoid at all costs.  This is clearly a case of the latter.  How this place has 4 stars is utterly beyond me.  This is the only place I have ever been I would literally give a 0 star if I could.  Being originally from the northeast  I truly love and appreciate Italian food.  What a disappointment.  While the food was not very good  the service takes this place down to an F-.  This was without a doubt the worst dining experience I have ever had in my entire life.  The majority of the people we interacted with were incredibly rude  to the point where you are just sitting trying to enjoy a nice dinner (an excessively expensive one at that)  and you start to feel defensive.  How can you possibly enjoy a dinner in that kind of atmosphere?   On top of that  everything took so long to get right by the time we got our food it was close to closing time.  This lead us to be the last table in the restaurant  trying to finish up while they were closing.  Before we had even finished everything  the manager kindly told us they are a union shop and have strict rules  and we were getting kicked out.  Yes really.  There are so many great restaurants  do yourself a favor and go literally anywhere else!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Exceptional food and service. We sat at the bar because we were in a rush to go see the show. Our bartender  the gentleman in his 40-50s was kind and attentive. He made great suggestions and had a warm and welcoming attitude. We ordered Squash ravioli and portobello pizza. We ended up having a great experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Best food in Vegas. Look no further! Octopus and the Scallops dishes are to die for! Great service  reasonable prices and chill atmosphere. Exactly what we were looking for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives at the Bellagio overlooking the fountains we sat inside 8 tonight and after our standard have a drink at the bar moment we proceeded to the table after getting a quick fountain show which is of course a don't miss anytime at the Bellagio especially when It is in tune to Sinatra.   Had lunch here sometime ago and I remember it being good  but the menu was recently changed and not really for the better.  Sommelier was very good and our waitress was excellent.  Breads presented followed by multiple appetizers including     Beef Carpaccio*  gorgonzola polenta  balsamic reduction  parmesan  cipollini onions  scallion cream  garlic aioli.....19 Best I've ever had.    Tuna Tartare*  spun cucumber salad  crispy rock shrimp  sesame dressing  scallion cream  whitefish caviar.....18 I didn't partake but was told it was OK nothing special.    Todd's Caesar Salad  eggless roquefort Caesar dressing  olive oil brioche croutons  tomatoes  shaved parmesan.....15  w/ anchovy fillets.....17 Traditional and large to split but dressing taste lacking    Fiery Chicken Sausage  herbed ricotta cheese  balsamic onions  roasted tomato sauce.....18 OUTSTANDING!   Meatball & Eggplant  spicy tomato sauce  caramelized onions  imported buffalo mozzarella  hazelnut basil pesto.....18  Very good.  Entrees: Butternut Squash Tortelli  brown butter  amaretto cookies  sage  parmesan cheese.....24 their signature dish was outrageous and Don't like Squash. Ricotta Ravioli  roasted tomato basil sauce  sweet Italian sausage  garlic bread crumbs.....25  EL PASSO nothing special here.  Hawaiian Mahi Mahi  lime & cilantro basmati rice  ginger bok choy  miso butter sauce  crispy leeks.....39 Another nothing special dish. Prime Beef Tenderloin  Lyonnaise potatoes  garlic braised greens  black pepper demi  truffle brie  crispy onions.....51 Small piece of beef for the price but very tasty.  Two Lobster Fra Diablo specials $54.00 over pasta were both extremely weak  sauce lacking in any taste or substance and lobster one small little tail.  Although our waitress was excellent extreme amount of time between appetizers and entrees to the point of where is our food?    Some dishes great some hit or miss some downright over priced and lacking.  A generous 2 star as 2.5 would be more accurate. Much better dining options in Vegas I'd pass on a repeat here. Fountain show good though go have a drink catch the show then eat elsewhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,That Beef Carpaccio is to die for!  So different from Flemings...and the serving size is huge!  A nice little surprise under that mound of goodness is a block of fried  blue cheese polenta. The balsamic glaze is crazy good!  Use the crisps that come in the bread basket...to transport it into your mouth. And then just sigh...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Tuna Carpaccio* 18.00 Olive oil mashed potatoes  crisp pasta cracker  lemon aioli  capers  parsley  Amazing! Service excellent! Enough said.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice atmosphere in the bustling Bellagio.  The Boston Bibb salad was picturesque and good.  exceptional roll basket including chocolate rolls.  Ordered the Squash pasta as the main course  and my group ordered the Mushroom daily special pasta with cream sauce dish.  The manager came by and asked if we were 100% satisfied  and I said my squash was good  bit at 90%.  He said I needed to be 100% and INSISTED that I select something else.  Needless to say that I went with the Mushroom dish and it was delish!   True CUSTOMER SERVICE and I look forward to visiting again soon!  Strong recommendation for Italian desires.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,From the warm friendly service to the delicious gnocchi  I enjoyed my visit to the utmost.  On my own tonight  I had hoped to grab a seat at the bar. V two different hosts checked with the bartenders to seer if a seat would open up soon  but my odds didn't look good.  Enter anther hostess  as I was asking about other restaurant options- bam! Take for one!.   Food was incredible  and for a guy that always wants more  the portion size was perfectly filling.    This will be a new Vegas staple for me!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Food was great  service was on point and great choice of outside or inside seating  We had the tuna carpaccio  unbelievable  with the soft olive oil potato underneath was excellent.  We also had the flat bread and seafood linguini.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not bad  not excellent. Nice patio view (not as good as Mon Ami).  Service is good.  Assorted bread basket paired with olive assortment and 2 types of olive spreads.  I asked for the cheese ravioli in a cream sauce. Server suggested that it didn't make for good flavor.  I chose a different pasta dish.   Beef carpaccio - $20 Large portion good to share 3 or more people. Overall good.  Arugula in the center over something like cornbread but sticky like rice cake (didn't care for that part)  Butternut squash tortellini - the first bite is excellent.  However it is very sweet.  And if you aren't in the mood for it  it is difficult to finish.   I could do with less squash and extra sage would be great.   For tortellini  carpaccio  sea bass  lobster add on  3 wine. $205 - 2 people with tip  In all honesty I've had a better tasting more satisfying meal at much more affordable Italian restaurants.  If I really want the view I would choose French at Mon Ami Gabi over this restaurant.  Decent service.  Just nothing spectacular about the food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best food we had in Las Vegas.  The Atmosphere was romantic  the staff were friendly  and the food was to die for (figure of speech).  We had the best Bread  Sole  and Short Rib there.  The wine pairing was perfect.  We'll be back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love the steak caesar salad here after a long day of working the plastic.  ___________________________________________________ Update 7/4/07  Returned for a quick lunch.  Steak caesar is gone.  Decided to create our own.  $18 for chewy flat iron steak atop less than appetizing romaine.  Also ordered the pork loin  dry  but generous in portioning.    Downgrading from FIVE to three stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was my first time dining here during my spring break a couple weeks ago and we thought we should give it a try since we always hear great things about the food. Turned out that the great things we heard were the great things we received. The service was great and even though the noise level is a bit high we still enjoyed the atmosphere. There food was amazing. I had the Ricotta Ravioli and it tasted like heaven. Couldn't finish the whole thing because the portion was big but  overall had a great meal with a delicious Tom Collins cocktail from the bar. I will be definitely visiting Olives again on my next trip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"No complaints here!  The service was great.  Paul L was our waiter and took good care of us.  The crispy flatbread served with the predinner bread was very yummy.  It had Parmesan cheese baked on it and had a little bit of spice to it.  This was served with a couple olive spreads and olives.  Surprisingly enough I am not an olive fan but the friends I was with said it was very good.  One of the orange olives they said had a mild wonderful taste.  I requested olive oil with balsamic vinegar for my bread and that was promptly brought.  I was trying to decide between butternut squash ravioli and the ricotta filled tortellini. When I said this to Paul he said  ""have half and half"".  Of course I would love that option!  The butternut squash was a warm yummy harvest taste. The filling was so smooth and the perfect amount of sauce was mild and just perfect.  They must have literally made the pasta when I ordered it. The filling was butternut squash not the pasta.  The tortellini was filled with a smooth and wonderful ricotta cheese.  This was not a heavy pasta either.  The marinara sauce was sweet and had finely ground sausage that was lean and wonderful.  Another person in our party had gnocchi.  Some places made big heavy gnocchi.  These were little thumbnail sized gnocchi shells that were light and held the sauce just perfect.     Oh my goodness  the creme brulee was out of this world and not a tiny little ramekin. We usually get a dessert to share but this was a special occasion and we each got our own and it was just about too much.   Perhaps it was circumstantial but we visited on December 14th which is a slower time in Vegas.  There was no wait.  It was a bit chilly to sit outside but we could see the water show from our table.  We were initially seated by a table of loud and obnoxious young men who were business guys with a college mentality.  These guys were not the fault of the restaurant and we requested a table change.  No problem.  The table linens were very nice  it was super clean and the price was just right for where we were.  We will go back and sit on the patio to watch the water show when it is warmer."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were on our way to dinner and stopped here for a quick drink.  I am a huge fan of blue cheese stuffed olives - I'm very particular when it comes to them because they really make or break the martini.  Todd English does not dissapoint.  They have the most amazing blue cheese stuffed olives that are served on a sprig of rosemary!  Talk about delicious is a Hendrick's gin martini!  Mmmmmm!  We plan to come here for dinner our next time in Vegas.  Great views of the Bellagio fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was going to let this restaurant go but then I saw all of the favorable reviews and I just had to put my two cents in.  This place absolutely does not live up to the hype in any way.  I made my birthday reservations at 7.30 so we could make the 10pm Cirque show.  We were seated right away  had our drink orders taken and promptly served and then we didn't see our server again for 15 mins.  My friends and I decided to go with the tasting menu which was simple enough.  The salad was more boring than anything that I've made out of my own refrigerator.  I was looking forward to trying the salmon over the english pea puree but that came out so salty I had to down my glass of water.  (which didn't get refilled for another 10 minutes).  My dessert order was wrong so that took time that we didn't have to correct.  And then by the time we were able to flag down our schoomzy (with every other table) server  we only had 10 minutes to book it to the theatre.  Really?  Almost 2.5 hrs to get through an completely unsatisfying dinner.  Boo.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My main recommendation for you when you dine at Olives is the Beef carpaccio - probably the best $20 plate --er  I mean MOUNTAIN-- of thinly sliced raw beef you will find. The balsamic and whatever the other sauce they drizzle over it makes it so flavorful and the beef is very high quality. Plus it comes with polenta and you can't go wrong with polenta. Ever.   You don't need to read anything else.   But in case you're curious  other noteworthy points-  -Great view of the Bellagio fountain show. I would've liked to sit outside to watch it but it was RAINING the day we went. Imagine that  rain in Vegas..  -Good service. Granted it was lunch time  so maybe they aren't as busy  but nonetheless our service was very nice and the food came out fairly quick.  -Ravioli was just OK  probably not worth $22. -Check the specials of the day. There was a seafood pasta on that menu the day we came and it was yummy. -The flat bread sandwiches are very large and they come with a huge serving of sweet potato fries!   Overall  this is a fancier establishment but if you want to save some $$  come for lunch. Get the beef carpaccio while you're at it and sit back  relax  watch the water show!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Place is fine for a drink while watching fountains  but a real foodie should avoid it. The food quality was very mediocre. The tuna tartar was oily and overwhelmed by scallions  the salad included hard stalky parts of the leaves  meat was charred  etc.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The hardest part about eating at this place is trying to decide what to eat.  Every single dish on the menu reads like a food orgasm.  When the actual food finally arrives  it actually lives up to the hype.    If I have any complaint at all  its that their lunch prices are ""dinner-expensive.""  Nonetheless  when I'm back in Vegas  I'm eating at Olives!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Loved this place. Quick lunch service. Our server was hilarious. We didnt sit outside but they have a really good view of the fountains. It is expensive  like everything else on the strip but definitely worth visiting again. Great vegetarian options too. They had at least 4 veggie options on the menu. Go here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,To be fair  I don't know why I'm not giving better reviews of my recent Vegas trip  but here goes another middle of the road experience. While I liked Olives  but I wasn't overly crazy about it.   We had reservations for a group dinner  and while the service was good I just wasn't overly impressed with the meal. We started with some flatbreads and a charcuterie board  and I think my favorite part of the charcuterie were the meats they chose to include - salami + prosciutto. The flat breads were good  but not anything you couldn't find somewhere else. I settled on the lobster pasta for dinner because I was really wanting a nice warm and heavy pasta for dinner...in August...this sounds weird  I know....but it really just didn't deliver. It was filling  but just didn't quite have the flavor I was looking for and felt it was just a little bland.  I'm not sure I'd choose to come here again - I'd probably choose to make the trek out to Tommy Bahama  or venture down the Strip to Mesa Grill or Bouchon instead 
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I stopped in for a drink and light meal before heading to the airport. Chose the place based on proximity to my training hotel and Yelp ratings and was not disappointed! The restaurant was changing over  but the bar was open. The bartenders were attentive and worked well as a team. I never felt rushed  even with the change over. I ordered the rosemary Manhattan. It was the best drink of my life. Seriously. Expertly made. I was given a bread basket with olives and two olive tapenades. Tasty  but a bit over salted. I wanted something with flavor  but not too heavy so I got the beef carpaccio. Very well prepared and perfect for what I was looking for before my flight!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Two words: Bread Basket.  We were in Vegas this past weekend and had a Valentine's Day lunch at Olives.   We have been to Olives before and do not at all remember the awesomeness of the bread basket.  But the first time we were there  we were totally babies - just started dating  all in love  sitting on the patio at night watching the fountains.  I was probably trying to impress him with my total indifference to carbs.  But here we are  a few years later  about to be married and I pretty much attacked that bread basket.  Onion focaccia  garlicy-cheesy crisp things  and spiced up dinner rolls.  I was in heaven!  We ate more than just bread - we shared the Calimari which was somewhat more salad-like than just regular calimari.  I thought the sauces were very good and ate more of the sauces/dressing and the greens than actual calimari.   He ordered a shrimp pasta dish that had some Asian flavors going on.  I think it was the pea shoots that I eat on other dishes  but it kind of threw me.  A very saucy dish  but good.  I had the Olives burger which I had my eye on from our last visit. The glazed balsamic onion was a nice addition and the burger itself was really juicy.  Combined with the greasy bun it made for a somewhat messy burger - and that sauced up onion was sliding all over the place!  We had very good service and it was a nice way to end an awesome weekend in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's difficult to give a restaurant with 4 stars a bad review but management needs to be aware of bad experiences along with good ones. Three of us had dinner last Wednesday night (11/3) and it was horrible. We had 9:30pm reservations which might have been the problem since they close at 10:30pm. The food and service were inexcusable...Mario is a good guy but at the mercy of management. What is so difficult about spaghetti? Two of us got ill. Please refund me the price of the 3 spagetti's ($96.) and I will forward to Second Harvest Food Bank so several families can have a nice Thanksgiving dinner. Mario should keep the 20% tip and the wine and desert were fine. Let's make all parties involved happy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Maybe they lost the hustle over there years? Not sure. I actually have been looking forward to trying out this restaurant for a few years  and have been waiting to get to Vegas. This was our least favorite meal over the three days we were in Vegas.  Atmosphere - slightly dated  loud  Service - mediocre  disorganized  Food - mediocre as well.  Bread Basket with Olives + Tapenade - ***** (amazing) Tomato Salad - ** (not fresh  bland) Squid + Octopus - *! (terrible  inedible  and server didn't ask why we didn't eat it  and she recommended it. Chewy. No flavor) Pork Chop w/gnocchi -- ** (barely okay  pork chop bland and poorly cooked  gnocchi's texture unappetizing and flavor was bland)  We skipped dessert since the only thing we ate that was good was the complimentary bread basket.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I didn't know who Todd English was until I watched him on Iron Chef America.  Remember the pizza dough challenge with Mario Batali?  Unfortunately  the judges weren't impressed because he lost that challenge.   The restaurant's airy and open layout  leather seats and dark lacquer tables  available patio seating by the Bellagio fountains lend to its low-key elegance  but I wasn't impressed with the dishes we had here.   Fortunately  it's restaurant week in Vegas (similar to Dine about Town in SF with prix fixe menus offered at reasonable prices). Part of the cost of your meal is donated to Three Square  an organization that is committed to eliminating hunger in Southern Nevada.  The prix fixe for dinner is $50.09.  We started with a lobster cocktail served with a yellow tomato puree and horseradish vinaigrette.  The lobster was fresh  while the sauce was boring.   For our entrees  bf had the grilled hangar steak with garlicky broccoli rabe  lentil and grain chili with cucumber raita.  The raita was a refreshing touch. The steak  cooked medium rare  was chewy.  That's probably attributed to the cut instead of the cooking method.   My butternut squash ravioli is free-from shaped  cooked in browned butter  sage and topped off with lots of parmesan cheese.  I like the contrast of the sweetness of the squash with the saltiness of the cheese.   Surprisingly  dessert wasn't disappointing.  We shared a chocolate trifle made with dark chocolate pudding  Bailey's white chocolate ganache  a sliver of a double chocolate cookie crunch topped off with vanilla bean ice cream.   Absolutely rich  absolutely no complaints.  Service was slow at the beginning but got better later on.  Friendly waiter and efficient bussers.  The lag time between dishes is long  but the bread basket and olive tapenade proved to be good distractions while waiting.  Thanks to restaurant week  the cost of dinner didn't hurt the wallet as much.  I don't think I want to pay full price for food that is less than stellar.  Especially from an Iron Chef challenger.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives provides a great view of the Bellagio water fountain show if you are seated outside. We were fortunately able to do that. The food was good depending on what you got and our table decided we'd just order a bunch of different dishes to share so we can taste many things.  The salads and appetizers came. Carpaccio  squid/octopus dish and then our last dish was missing in action. It didn't arrive for a very long time - you know when you stomach has communicated to your brain that it's eaten enough.  Yeah. It was at least 25 minutes or more.  And every time we waived to a waiter  he didn't come. It appeared to be amateur hour on the wait staff.  I don't know. Maybe Todd English has stopped monitoring his restaurant to let it all go down with his name with it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food at Olives is great  but my husband and I were kind of caught off guard by the portion sizes which ruined our meal a bit lol.  Being from New York  we're used to small appetizers. When we go out  we'll share a few appetizer dishes and one or two main courses. At Olives  we ordered the beef tartare  tuna tartare  charcuterie board  a flatbread  and the gnocchi. Our server  Paul  who was very sweet  suggested we order the carpaccio instead of the beef tartare since it was the most popular appetizer. Expecting like six slices of raw beef and a few mesclun green leaves  we were surprised when this large plate came out with a mountain of beef. The carpaccio was all over the plate and in the center  it covered a mound of greens and a polenta cake. The carpaccio and tuna tartare were delicious  but were so filling. I wish our server had warned us.  After those two appetizers  it was hard to enjoy anything. The flatbread with fontina  ham  and asparagus was great. The charcuterie board was nice  but we could've done without it. The gnocchi in pesto cream was also okay  but at this point  we could barely touch it we were so full.  The view of the fountain itself is worth going here though.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Realizing that our last day in Vegas was also the start of Restaurant Week  I quickly made reservation for lunch at Todd English's Olives because it was so cheap. A three course meal was only $20.09  which was relatively cheap for Vegas and comparable to a hand of blackjack. They really don't kid about the namesake of this restaurant. Right off the bat  we were given bread and three different types of olive spread. While I do love olives  I found them to be quite salty and boring after a few bites. But the bread basket was good  which was filled with various different types of bread.   For the first course  I tried both the BBQ pork tartlet as well as the crispy calamari. The tartlet was good because of the puff pastry. The calamari was great because it was fried to perfection and it was battered in tempura for a change. For my entree  I tried the chilled rare tuna nicoise. The tuna was seared perfectly  but the dish was littered with more olives. The one surprise of the dish was the smoked hard boiled egg. I say surprising because it was very smokey  but almost to the point where it overpowered everything else on the plate. For dessert  I had the drunk chocolate trifle. This dessert was actually my favorite course of the meal. The double chocolate cookie and white chocolate ganache left me wanting more.   For Restaurant Week prices  the meal had great value  but for an ordinary restaurant  I see nothing special here. I can see how the theme of olives perpetuates throughout the menu  but they could be a lot more subtle. Olives are very bold in flavor and when they are just randomly sprinkled in a dish or served as a spread  it is just unimaginative and boring. The lack of creativity in this aspect left something more to be desired.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Uhhhh YUM! Olives was a total delight. Starting with the amazing martinis. We ate on the patio and I had booked this lunch about 3 weeks in advance because I had heard from an LV native that Olives was great and a wonderful place to watch the fountains. Now I really want to come back for dinner some time! I got the prix fixe lunch and I loved every part of it. more than enough food and I think it was around 25 bucks. The view was absolutely beautiful  one of the most fun things I did in vegas! Love it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I order steak and pork chops  my sister had scallops and risotto. The octopus appetizer was delicious.  The ambience was elegant. The wine selection are good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was horrible. The food took ages  the waiter screwed up our order  and after waitng for what felt like hours.. it wasn't even edible !! I wouldn't suggest it at all.. but if for some strange reason it's a must  stick with the beef carpaccio. Everything else I tried - from the pasta to the chicken - to the tuna tartare was a nono.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My partner and I had a very good dinner here on Sept 8th. It was the first time for both of us. We were seated right at our reservation time.  I really like the look of the room  very warm colors  interesting shapes. It feels a little crowded though. We were seated on banquets( long bench/table/chair ) along the wall and although not packed in as tight as Paris or NYC seating  It did feel tighter than I like. People on either side of me were closer than I like. Would be nice if they removed 3 or 4 tables from the room.  We had a bit of a view of the Bellagio fountains  a nice touch. The room is very loud  not from blaring music  just very loud from the crowd. It is not a room for an intimate conversation. We were slightly dressed up - blazers with dressy shirts and pants and nice shoes and were dressed better than most in the room. The food was mostly excellent. Service began with a nice assortment of breads and a plate of various olives and two tapenades  all excellent. For apps we had the carpaccio  which was one of the best ever and the beef tartare which was good but under seasoned for my taste. Our dinners were the veal and fontina fazzoletti and the short rib paparadelle. I thought the veal had a slightly scorched taste but was still very good. The short rib was wonderful  very rich  flavorful and tender. Some of the pasta was gummed together  not a deal breaker but kind of a drag. I mentioned it to our waitress  who was great  and she offered to replace it but I was fine with it and didn't want to interrupt the pace of our dinner.  We also had a couple of wines by the glass which were very well paired to the food. Desert was excellent -  an assortment of cookies and ice cream. Probably the best plate of cookies I've had.  I will be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I won't comment on the food  because we were arriving at 9 after O show and usually I don't have appetite at that time. But the view for patio seats was amazing! Do remember make reservations!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,i came here a while ago and the food was good but i dont remember it being great as to where i absolutely have to come back.  wine list is good  olive and cheese appetizer was good. everything was good but not like off the charts.  people say this place has potential... because it does.  service is very good  but i would rather try something new.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great place for lunch! Great service. Great food. Great ambiance.  We enjoyed both the Tuna Carpaccio and the Beef Carpaccio. They were both starters  but totally enough for the 2 of us. Complimentary breads and tapanades were good too. Ice tea was nice and refreshing  but really  $4.50 for ice tea? Other than that  we enjoyed our lunch at Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great restaurant with great food and a very accommodating staff.  We were there during the Consumer Electronics Show and I have to admit the staff handled the volume well.  We were seated promptly  food was brought out in a timely fashion  and when one of our guests excused himself for an extended period of time the wait staff took back his placed and put it under a warming light.    As for the food itself their flat bread pizzas are great and the salads were quite large.  Drinks were... well non-alcoholic given that we were there for lunch meetings  but regardless very well mixed.  Beyond that I have to admit despite being the Bellagio I felt the pricing wasn't all that bad so would definitely recommend it for business lunches.  Just make sure you call ahead as they can fill up.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had been dreaming about a meal at Olives for my first trip to Vegas. We were hoping for a seat on the patio to get a prime view of the fountains at night. No luck - the place was absolutely packed  and even though we made a reservation 2 MONTHS in advance  we were seated in a spot that was cramped next to two other tables and near the waiter station.  The food had its ups and downs. I loved the appriopriate bread and olives that were served  and our tuna tartar was seriously amazing. Then I ordered the fish thinking it would be cooked perfectly in such a fine dining environment. Instead  it was an overcooked and completely underseasoned piece of rubber - I couldn't believe it. Okay  okay  maybe I should have ordered something safer  but this is Olives for goodness' sake! Everything should be safe  especially at $40 an entree. I was extremely disappointed and we mentioned something to our waiter at the end of the meal. I left in a sour mood after wasting that money on what I thought was a guaranteed to be perfect meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,goat cheese stuffed pork chop - sucks for you it's not on the menu anymore - not sure if that's a good thing but it was VERY good.  all around great place to have dinner in vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We chose this restaurant for our ""fancy dinner out"" in Vegas and I'm so glad we did. The ambiance was just what I was looking for...dark  romantic  and modern  while not being stuffy and too quiet. We had reservations and when we checked in  we asked for a table with a view of the fountains. We only had to wait an extra 10 minutes for the table.   I ordered the Chicken & Gnocchi and my husband had the Roasted Maine Lobster Fra Diavolo. We both loved our pastas. I'm not much of a steak eater  so I loved that the menu offered so many different options. We got the fancy steakhouse feel  but with delicious pasta and flatbread options. I loved that.   The menu is a bit pricey  but considering the other comparable dinner restaurant options nearby  it was on par. The great food  service  and ambiance made it worth it  especially for a nice dinner out. I definitely plan on returning next time I'm in vegas!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is played out. In every way. I am sure it is still doing amazing numbers but then again at Dairy Queen would in that location. The menu and offerings see little change. Its stale. Nearly the same salad offerings and flatbread offerings from 3 years ago.  I came here for lunch despite knowing this because on their website they had a pork sandwich in a chimichurri sauce. Well the silver told me they took it off the menu of the day before and they cannot make it for me. I had there gnocchi in a  sausage ragu. The sauce was excellent. The pasta was pasty.  Wife's chicken in madera sauce was bland and dull. Starter salads good. Very. But tiny for $15.  The only thing good at this point is the bread basket with olive tapenade and the outdoor seating. For the money you can do much better in and around the Bellagio casino and hotel. Todd English is a good chef and should be given the opportunity to recon cept this space. Otherwise let someone else do it. I'm done with olives
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Inspired cooking in Vegas remains the exception  not the rule.   So lets just acknowledge that Todd English's Olive stands out in Vegas.  Yes tucked away in Bellagio's mini-mall-GASP.....but also a spacious patio that sits on top of the stunning dancing water fountain Duhhhhh....  Who wouldn't  want to enjoy life here.  For food lovers and cocktail goers this is for you.  Mediterranean cuisine that is skinny jean approved.  Best Negroni served at the bar.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,#1  it's very rare for me to give a 5-star rating.  #2  ask for Russ as your server  what a gem!  I was so pleasantly surprised at Olive's. I had heard good things  but being that it is not one of the top billed eateries on the Strip  I didn't have terribly high expectations. Todd English is an amazing chef  so I knew it wouldn't be bad however!   We had a reservation and were seated right away; which may not sound like anything to remark over  but I've experienced hour-long waits in Las Vegas even when I had made reservations.   Our waiter  Russ  was such a doll. Knowledgeable  friendly  there when you needed him & gone when you didn't. He didn't mind at all that my colleague and I needed lots of time to decide and had loads of questions.   We both started with a cocktail  The Slingback. It was delish! Absolut Ruby Red  passion fruit puree and a couple other things I can't remember. But boy did it go down easy...  For our started we chose the beef carpaccio which I had heard much about. Boy  you Yelpers know your stuff...this was hands down the best carpaccio I've ever had. And I've had hundreds! It was melt-in-your-mouth delicious and I could not get enough. The serving size was massive; more than enough for my colleague and I and probably enough for 4 to split.   For entrees I had the Lobster Bolognese and Janet had the cast-iron Branzino. Both were just divine. The lobster bolognese was something dreams were made of. Handmade pasta really capped of the flavors  and there was a puree of anise which I normally would have avoided like the plague  but it paired so well with the sauce. I was in heaven and ate way more than my lil tummy could handle!   We were too full for desert (tragic  I know) but there were multiple selections that sounded amazing.   The food  service  ambiance  and character of our waiter made for one of the best meals I've had in years. I would go back in a heartbeat and I really hope I get to!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here for dinner during a business trip.  I've always wondered about the restaurant located behind the Bellagio fountains.  The service was superb.  Our table of 4 split the beef carpaccio and tuna tartare.  Both were pretty amazing. I ordered the clams linguine.  It was probably one of the best I've ever had.  So light  so tasty with a hint of lemon juice.  The noodles weren't your regular linguine noodles but more like thin slices of lasagna.  I ate it so fast!  One of my co-workers ordered the salmon and he said it was pretty dry.  Another co-worker ordered the mushroom paparedelle.  Though  good  it was a bit on the heavy side.  The 3rd co-worker...well  honestly I can't remember what he ordered!  With drinks  appetizers and main courses our bill came close to $450.  I wouldn't say it was worth all that money  but it was good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made reservations beforehand. We were seated on time and got to sit in the patio. Great view of the fountains and the strip. Had the octopus as an appetizer it was really good. I ordered the salmon with risotto  it had a crispy skin that have it a crunch. It all tasted great. My bf had the gnocchi it was a bit sweet but still good with the goat cheese. Also had the tiramisu  prefect ending to our dinner. Definitely recommend  it was a nice restaurant and not as expensive as other nice places in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Place was great I ordered the chicken and Agnolotti wonderful items that will not disappoint. The olive tapenade was so tasty on the bread selections they brought out. The service was no good. The place was packed server wasn't excited about the food and that's a huge loss he didn't make any recommendations on the menu and lacked so much for this great place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I know this isn't the hippest new place on the strip but it is a very solid go-to. You can't argue with the location in the Bellagio with the view of the fountains and there are lots of great options on the menu.   The olive spread and bread selection doesn't disappoint.  I had a rabbit duo (braised leg and stuffed loin) and both were delicious. It's really hard to make rabbit without it drying out and they did it perfectly. The stuffed loin was tasty  braised leg was perfect. And great portions (no overly tiny food here).  The only slightly disappointing thing was the dessert! Molten cake was just ok (they were out of the ice cream pie we wanted). But I would definitely come back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I can't even tell you how much I love this place! But the only downfall is I'm picky and I have to sit on the balcony I love watching the water show during dinner not too fond of the inside diner but I've been here over 5 times and will continue coming great food amazing staff definitely on my top five restaurants in all of Las Vegas
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beautiful space  great for lunch  but would love to return in the evening. The food is pretty good - pricier than its worth but expected for Vegas. I would definitely return for a brunch or a romantic evening dinner some time.  Also would be great to sit outside! Lots of reasons to return and try it again :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,How can you not give this place 5 stars. Everything from the wine to entrees was perfection. The server was so sweet. And made some fantastic recommendations. This place is worth ordering an $80 bottle of wine. We had the charcuterie board (salami prosciutto goat cheese Brie cheese and Gouda I believe) then we had the lamb chops and pork chop. Both plates were empty. I actually asked for another bread basket so I can soak up the rest of the sauce on my plate from the pork chop and gnocchi. This is defiantly a place to try in Vegas  I'm local and defiantly going back:)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I started with a $15 mojito at the bar. And then I elected the prix fixe dinner menu for $55. I regretted the latter decision. Although the starter two oysters were fresh  they were tiny  and I could tell from that that the rest of my meal would be unsatisfyingly small in portion. And indeed it was! My steak was probably only 6-8 oz. and was extremely dry and somewhat chewy and charred. But the sauce was good  though it didn't do enough to cover up the char. Lastly  the sorbet dessert was disappointing because the texture was that of dying-sorbet-making-machine-frozen-yogurt.   But. The service was wonderful. Our waiter was extremely patient while we perused the menu  and even helped us out when we overheard us discussing how to obtain show tickets. He was sincere and kind  and frequently returned to our table to make sure everything was going well. And the beef carpaccio was amazing. I was extremely apprehensive about eating raw beef  but I worried to no avail. The beef was thinly sliced  spread atop a bed of cornbread and spring greens  and sprinkled with prosciutto. Just amazing. The patio view is great  too. You can watch the fountain show while having dinner--how often do you get to do that?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Flat bread! Yay! Not really. Well that's what everyone else in the restaurant was raving about. Every table had a plate of flat bread on it. Actually everyone at my table  except me and one other friend  ordered flat bread too. I tried a slice with portabello mushrooms and a slice with tomatoes and mozarella cheese. I was not impressed. I thought free basket of bread provided tasted a lot better. So why the four stars? Those four precious sparkly stars go to my butternut squash tortelli and the rack of lamb that my friend order. I thought there could be some improvement in the sauce that the tortelli was placed on  such as a little less salt  but it's no biggie. As long as you drench the tortelli in the sauce  you're good. My friend's lamb was also quite amazing. The meat was really tender and it felt like it melts in your mouth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My friends had a morning flight out of vegas and I had an early evening flight  so I decided to enjoy a top rated meal experience with part of my time in the afternoon (I had to depart too soon to have dinner). I looked at the reviews and decided to start with the Beef Carpacchio appetizer and was debating what to try for an entree. However  the waiter suggested that the appetizer would be a meal in itself. He was definitely right. The bread bowl includes some great custom home-made breads and some signature olives and olive dips which is filling in itself. The Beef Carpacchio came on an entree size plate and includes a lot of very thin sliced high quality rare beef with a mix of cheeses  greens  buttery bread/cake  etc. It was delicious and by the time I was finished I was full. In the end I believe I got out for around $30 with an excellent and very filling lunch at a celebrity chef restaurant. Another great thing about this place is that they are open for lunch and most of the afternoon  unlike a lot of the other places which are dinner only or close most of the afternoon. I look forward to going back with a larger group of people and splitting more appetizers and trying at least one entree. Also  some of my friends had gone here earlier when I was at another great place  and they got patio seating for the Bellagio fountain show  which is apparently a great experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had an amazing dinner for two last night at Olive's. The food was EXCELLENT. I ordered the chicken & artichoke flatbread with grilled shrimp on the side. Everything tasted wonderful...even chicken-which can sometimes be bland & tasteless-was amazing! It had an orangey glaze which I've never experienced before in any meal. My bf ordered the free range roasted chicken...I could tell he loved it because he ate everything on his plate!  The reason I only gave four stars: we had reservations & still had a TWENTY MINUTE WAIT. Not cool. Inside the restaurant it was extremely noisy  so we asked to be seated out on the patio. The patio is awesome because it's much less noisy  plus you get to see the Vegas skyline & Bellagio dancing fountain.   Another good thing about this place: our wait staff was very friendly & attentive...even took pics of me & my date for us...then posed for his own cameo:)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love it  love it  love it!  Favorite spot in Vegas.  Try a Tiffany martini and the beef carpaccio.  Osso busco is my all time fav dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Finally had the chance to stop by to check out the bar. The bar set up was great like no other  unique and great ambiance. Friendly staff and great customer service. Bartender definitely knew his product.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My man picked this place on our first night in LV. The  atmosphere of the restaurant is very romantic. Our server was very knowledgeable about the Specials and the Menu. We had the Hudson Valley Foie gras for our appetizer  Sad to say it was a very small dish and it wasn't even good for sharing but it was very flavorful. I had the Sausage Ravioli and my boyfriend had the Lobster Fettucine. My Ravioli is delicious but the Lobster Fettucine was very dissapointing! A $45 dish with very few lobster pieces and was very soupy. The menu description was very misleading. I feel bad for my boyfriend because he has high expectations about the said restaurant. I think the highlight of our meal was the chocolate peanut butter lava cake and the bread basket. This place is overrated.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My friend took me here for a little celebration for my husband. She's been here before and really enjoyed it. I  on the other hand  thinks this this restaurant is a bit overpriced (granted it's on the strip) for food that isn't really that great. I ordered gnocchi which was probably the worst I've yet to have. My sister ordered their scallop and it was heavily salted. The service was OK  not great  not bad. Honestly  I don't think I would come back here. It was good for the experience sitting by the fountain  but they kept turning the music volume high and low which kind of made it not so great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good view  TERRIBLE experience.   My group of 8 was seated promptly per our reservation  and we were impressed with our view of the fountains. We gave ourselves 2 hours for dinner before we caught a show. We informed our server  who assured us that we would absolutely make the show. That's when it all went downhill.  It took 30min to get drinks ordered  then another 20min to receive them. Only then was food able to be ordered  and only then to come out another 40min later.   Not only was the food incredibly delayed  it was also incredibly inaccurate. A girlfriend and I both ordered a gnocchi dish  but both received a red penne pasta with 3 measly slices of chewy  overcooked duck. We were left with 5min to eat our inaccurate  poorly cooked  overpriced food before running (in heels  of course) to still miss the opening of our show.  Also  I couldn't help but notice the table next to us complaining from the moment we arrived. And where was our server the whole time? Avoiding his upset tables  I assume.   I also cannot help but notice that other poor reviews name similar complaints. And the business offers an apology? Sweet notion  but that just doesn't make up for a terrible experience - it certainly won't feed my group and I when we were seriously hungry  and it definitely doesn't put my money back in my wallet.  NEVER AGAIN will I dine at Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If I could give this place 0 stars I would. Food was not as described in the menu  one $30 plate was room temperature and all of the meat was fat. Also I had to get up and get my water refilled at the bar.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had lunch here today and had a very nice experience. The food was delish and service was great! Even the bread and olives they give you were delicious. We were also given a table outside with a view of the fountains. They gave us a free birthday Dessert as well. Great experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Anytime my husband and I want a romantic date or a great place to socialize with our friends over a great dinner  Olives is the place we go in Las Vegas.  The balcony overlooks the Bellagio fountains  so not only do you get a fabulous dinner but the view is spectacular.  As for price- the value doesn't get much better than Olives...  Less pricey than most places on the strip  Olives offers predictably good food at an affordable price.  The beef carpaccio appetizer melts in your mouth.  Butternut squash is one of my favorite dishes.  This past weekend  I had the shrimp crusted pacific swordfish and lump crab beignets.  Balcony seating is first come first serve.  The secret?  Make a fairly early dinner reservation (between 5-7).  Arrive 30-45 minutes early and let the hostess know you'd like to sit outside and ask if they can put you on the list while you enjoy a drink in the bar.  It works every time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Great ambiance  restaurant has a view of the Bellagio fountain but it was too cold to eat outside. Ordered the grilled octopus & squid with chickpeas and the tuna tartare for appetizers  both were blah.  The first was just mostly chickpeas and the second was lacking in flavor  only a hint of sesame oil. These two just didn't do anything for us.  Although my short rib lasagna was great  very different from a typical red sauce lasagna and the portion was pretty big. I loved their assorted bread and our waiter was really friendly. They didn't allow us to have a birthday cake since it's ""foreign"" so that kinda sucked.  Overall  okay experience but nothing crazy."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The service was very good  but the food was mediocre - at best. The only thing worth eating for the price was the bread basket with olive tapenade.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,AVOID THIS TOURIST TRAP: high prices  poor service  mediocre food  boring menu.  Save your money for the slot machines (and not at the Bellagio).  On our way to Olive's  we asked some Bellagio workers for directions.  One pointed us in the right direction.  But  as we walked away  his coworker made an insulting wisecrack (unbelievably rude).  The hostesses at Olives were friendly and helpful. The waiter  on the other hand  was simply indifferent. He offered helpful information only when directly questioned. At these prices  I expect more - professionalism. at the very least.  What we got was some burned-out character  who only came alive when offering us desserts (and then  only half-heartedly.)  At fine restaurants  I look for creativity in the menu  especially the appetizers. The menu completely lacked creativity - no interesting appetizers  no interesting entrees  not even an interesting soup.  (Potato soup  really? Is this Luby's?)   The central theme in the menu appeared to be food that can be cranked out relatively quickly in mass quantities (so they can hurry the customer out the door).  We were disappointed with the entrees.  The steak - terrible.  The short ribs - poor.  The chicken - mediocre.  The branzini (fish) - okay (nothing to write home about).  Again  at these prices  you expect fine cuisine.  Instead  you get overpriced mediocre food.    We all declined dessert.  Nobody at the table seemed willing to throw good money after bad.  Nor should you.  As we left  other unlucky tourists stood outside  waiting to be seated.  I wanted to warn them to stay away (but didn't want to make a scene).  So  I'm warning you: stay away from Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is great place to view the fountains at The Bellagio.  My friend & I were sat at a table right near the windows.  You can sit outside on the patio  but it was too cold for us.  Service was great  everything looked delicious on the menu & everything we ordered was great!  My favorite thing is that the restaurant wasn't too crowded & the music wasn't too loud.  It was the perfect ambience to relax & have a nice dinner while in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good yummy selection of complimentary bread and wine.  I have a Petite Sirah which complemented well with my entree.  Porterhouse steak is filling but not the high exquisite expectation I expected from the Bellagio.  The staff came to check on our table often.  Wished the server came to us more often to check on our meals and wine.   The banana tiramisu is delicious!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,More over-hyped celebrity chef food.    I had called in the morning to inquire about reserving a table on the patio to see the fountains  and the hostess told me they don't reserve those tables  I would just have to show up and ask to be seated there.  So I asked if I should go ahead and make a regular reservation for dinner if that was my plan and she said it wouldn't be necessary.  Well my husband really wanted to eat here  so we called a little later to make a reservation just in case  and they told us the only time left they had was 9:30pm!!  Good thing we called  or I don't even know if we would have gotten in!!  So we showed up early just in case and a different hostess very rudely said they were no longer taking names for the patio because there were too many people already on the list.   Fine  whatever.  When she takes us to our table  we're the only table open that does NOT have a view out the window so I ask if we can be seated at one of the other tables instead  and she (again) rudely tells me no  those are all reserved.  Argh.    Anyway  we thoroughly enjoyed most of the stuff in the bread basket and the olive tapenades that accompanied while we waited for our food.  People weren't kidding when they said portions were big here!!  Definitely plan on splitting everything!    Our first dish was the soft shell crab with the watermelon panzanella.  This sounded really interesting  but did not execute at all.  The soft shell crab was soggy and did not taste fresh  and the watermelon/olive/whatever else was in the salad was just a cacophany of mismatched flavors.  We forced down the crab and I ate the watermelon pieces but we left the rest.    My husband's dish was less than memorable; I think it was the ricotta ravioli.  A giant bowl of tasteless pasta  with tasteless sausage.  If it hadn't been so blah  I would have been happy to trade my beef tenderloin au poivre with him.  It was a ginormous piece of meat  and while it was cooked properly  it just had no flavor  other than the mounds of cracked peppercorns encrusting it.  Did not taste like tenderloin quality AT ALL.  I figured I should be safe with the most expensive thing on the menu  but nope.  We left quite a bit of that too  which is pretty rare because my husband will go to great lengths not to waste food.  It was only edible slathered in the curried bisque that came with it.  The coconut yogurt sauce was just a tiny drop of white in a sea of orange.    It was after dinner that our waiter turned a pretty bad experience around.  Since it was getting so late  most of the people on the patio had left  and he told us to get our things and that we were going to sit by the fountains!!!!  That was a real treat--we got to watch the last three or four shows before it stopped at midnight.   The entire meal experience surely would have been enhanced had we been out there the whole time!!!  So we ordered up a vanilla souffle and some drinks and THOROUGHLY enjoyed the rest of our evening out there.  The souffle was very yummy  by the way.  I haven't had too many souffles but this was tops for me.     So the gorgeous ambience  great view  and yummy souffle contributes three stars...but the rest of our food was pretty crappy.  Three stars might be high but that view almost makes up for it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So good! So delicious. Great view.  We actually came to this restaurant because it was thanksgiving weekend and every. single. buffet line was at least an hour wait --- and I was HUNGRY. So we ended up walking to countless restaurants being picky and reading the menus. I heard that this was a Mediterranean restaurant & I was sold. I love Mediterranean.  Little did I know the gorgeous spot they would sit us in!!! We had sooo much food. Tuna tartare appetizer  split a salad  and our entrees. Plus the delicious bread. Like I said  we were hungry. But it was all so delicious and so gorgeous. I'll be back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was surprisingly good.  I always walk pass Olives whenever I'm shopping at Bellagio but was never tempted to check it out.  The restaurant is located inside the Bellagio right across from Dior and has a gorgeous view from their patio of the Bellagio water fountain. I had a delicious lunch here for father's day with my hubby and his family.  I didn't expect much but I was pleasantly surprised at how tasty each dish was  and they were served up in generous portions too :] Their flat bread was definitely delicious.  We ordered the Italian flatbread which came with Italian salami  ham  prosciutto  tuscan meatballs  imported provolone  and a spicy tomato sauce. It was a savory combination of delicious meats.  Deelish! The scallops were also amazing. I got a chance to try everyone's entrees and they were all really good. I highly recommend sitting at their patio during lunch so you can enjoy the great water show while dining.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The menu is robust with options to please about any taste.  There is an excellent wine list.  The ambiance is something special.  If possible reserve or request a patio table and dine overlooking the Bellagio water show!    A wonderful service experience caps off the overall great dining experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's a great value place at the bellagio  but you pay for that with rushed service that is focused on table turnover and not a relaxed environment.   The food is good  the service is okay.   At the price point   it's probably the right place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view  and ambiance was great. But if you want a seat with a good view of the fountain  you'll have to wait.   The food was definitely well prepared. A lot of attention to each dish  and high quality products. I got the agnolotti (braised veal) and my date got the seafood risotto. Agnolotti was flavorful  but the veal is braised to the point of shreds/mush which I wasn't expecting. Also  the portion was really small. The seafood risotto was apparently amazing  but I also didn't think it was too impressive. Again  you wouldn't get these dishes if you wanted a decent sized meal to fill you for the night. Order it for the taste and flavor.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Skip the buffet and came over to Olives... we were seated outside  right by the lake.. OMG  best view ever!!   They have this winter pre-fixe menu  so we both ordered that. We got the butternut squash soup  bf got the steak  i got the white fish and both had desserts... for $30 each. WHAT A DEAL!!  Great good with a great view  hell yeah!! Love it
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overpriced food.  The dishes were cooked sloppy and wine was not impressive.  We had 2 different Pinot Noir by glass and they weren't all that.  The bread basket was dry.  The Dior sign across the restaurant is a total eye soar and ruins ambience.  I would not go here again.  Spend your money somewhere else and save the drama of the wait.  Our waitress was very nice.  They did special order a vegetarian primavera for me but papardelle was stuck together and it was too salty
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Been here twice . First time we waited 20 min before we was asked if we wanted a drink. But the food was good but very over priced. So we thought we would give it another go this time we went as a small group. They got the orders wrong the food had no taste . This  place is very over priced. This place is only still open because of its location . Wouldn't go back ever
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I wish I could give this place more stars because I am a huge Todd English fan.  The view from the patio was perfect.  It felt like our own private oasis in the middle of the Vegas strip.   The service was also good.  The food was good  but not GREAT for what you are paying.  We started with the Beef Tartare.  It was really lacking flavor The black truffle emulsion was really good when you could scrape up a little bit of it just for more flavor  but there was very little on the plate.  I had the scallops and they were good.  Cooked perfectly.   My husband had a sirloin steak which was supposed to have a Cajun rub I believe.  He said it really didn't seem like it had much of anything.  In order to enjoy good Todd English cuisine  next time I'm in Vegas  I'll stick to his P.U.B.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Heard it was good for its seafood so I was super excited to try this place during my visit to Vegas. The inside is dark  but the atmosphere is relaxing and really pretty. I love the location of Olives  because you can see the Bellagio watershow outside the window while you eat. Pretty awesome.   Starters: I ordered the Capaccio and was really glad i did. The meat was fresh  and comes with a little salad  Dishes: I ordered the Halibut. It was okay  i wasn't too impressed with it. My friend who told me to get this dish said the fish is suppose to taste like butter. But it didn't. It was still good. Loved the spinach risotto  it made the whole dish more on the creamy side.   The sea bass on the other hand  tasted like butter. If i could have a do-over  i would order the sea bass.   The ribeye was nothing out of the ordinary  but still delicious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I came here with my mom on four separate occasions during our most recent trip to Vegas.  Twice for lunch  once for dessert  and once for drinks.  Each time this place did not disappoint.  It's located just inside the Bellagio  near all of the shops that sell things which very few people can afford.  They do have a small  but nice outdoor patio.  They have big umbrellas and misters to help you avoid the heat.  It has a nice view of the fountain show if you eat out there at night.  I tried several different things while I was here:  Caesar salad  complimentary bread  gnocchi  cheeseburger and fries  rasberry mojito  and some cookie ice cream sandwiches.  Everything I had was really good.  Lots of good flavors in all of their dishes.  They're also big on presentation  which I like as well.  I probably liked the cheeseburger and fries the best.  It was full of flavor  and it was huge.  I don't think you could go wrong with most anything on the menu  though.  It's probably better to come here for lunch  as everything is a little cheaper.  That said  it's still fairly pricey for lunch.  Then again  you're in the Bellagio in Vegas.  You're not going to find any Burger King type prices anywhere in this place.  I would highly recommend this place if you're looking for a nice lunch or dinner with an excellent view.  I enjoyed everything and will be back when the opportunity presents itself.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I really like Olives -- the food is good  the wine list is well-thought  and the atmosphere is excellent.  Getting a seat on the balcony that overlooks the Bellagio fountains is a truly wonderful experience  especially at night  though the inside of the restaurant is fine too (a steakhouse feel due to the dimmer lighting).  Have had really standout service here -- the waiters  managers  and sommelier will take good care of you.  A final word on the atmosphere; the last two times I have gone  I have seen a proposal on the balcony (outdoor seating area)  so it really is quite special.  I do feel that this is priced into the menu  so if you are not at all interested in watching the fountains or dining at the Bellagio  you could easily get as good a meal elsewhere on the strip at significantly lower cost.  The reservations line you get through Google or Bellagio.com connects to the hotel's central reservations line  and they don't have a very good sense of how booked the restaurant is.  By asking the central reservations agent to connect you directly to the host (""can you transfer me to the restaurant?"")  you will often be able to get a table even if the reservations agent tells you that the restaurant is fully booked."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here based on Yelp reviews  and the fact that we were staying at the Bellagio resort. We made a reservation with the concierge and were accomodated for an 8:30 sitting. We were escorted to the table and thought the room looked nice albeit dark. We sat down and started to chat but could hardly hear each other. The restaurant was very busy and the noise was down to the full house as well as the hard walls and tile floor. The hostess gave us two menus and an ipad. No explanation but basically figured the ipad was the wine list and menu pics etc. the server checked in and asked if we would like to start with some wine  I said that we werent sure what we were going to eat so would need some time before our wine choice. BIG MISTAKE  at least 20 minutes passed before we saw him again  we were on minute three of our 5 minute countdown to walking out. We ordered the carpaccio  the mushroom tagliatelle and the gnocci and a bottle of Layer Cake. The carpaccio arrived and it was as advertised  delicious. We also got some tappenade but I just don't get the white chocolate scone as an accompanyment. We again waited for what seemed a very long time for the remnants of the carpaccio to be taken away. And then we waited  and waited. the table next to us who came in while we were ordering recieved their appy and entree and were deciding about desert while our server announced that the kitchen would be plating our pasta momentarily. I would have complained directly to this guy but he was a ghost. A different person was continually dropping off our food or refilling our water. Once the pasta arrived   the gnocci was fine  nothing special  and the mushroom pasta was well over cooked  mushy and stuck together  at the quality check we actually mentioned that its was just Ok  but no reaction. Bottome line? don't bother
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food  knowledgeable sommelier  elegant atmosphere
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My boyfriend surprised me with a night of romance.  He called told me to put on that pretty dress that one he likes oh so well. I knew just the one he was referring.  He asked me to meet him at the bar by our ""dorm"". When I Arrived He Was inside Had My Beer Waiting  We Had A Drink And Then Off We Went. Not having a idea of where to next. As we drove down towards the strip  my heart was racing I knew it would be a great surprise.  We started with a appetizer at my favorite spot  walked over to olives  where at my table were the prettiest flowers I had ever laid eye's on. The night became magical with him ordering a drink just the way he knew I would like  dinner was amazing.  Our server was great  I apologize I forget his name  but he was very helpful.as we watched the water show  he told me how lucky he was to have met me. For the first time I heard the 3 words we all desperately hope for. I love you.  The night couldn't of gone any better  but it did. He then took me listen to the piano player  it was there we had our first dance."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my 4 th trip to Olives  over 4 years. This visit was a disappointment  esp as I had a guest from Palm Springs. Service was attentive but sloppy. Ice cubes left melting  on the table as server was careless. LOUD African tribal music made conversation difficult  in this lovely venue.  Menu odd.  Not all choices should be 'fusion'. We had eaten at Mon Amie Gabi previous pm  with much better food.  Would have stayed longer at Olives and enjoyed the $27/ glass wine  but the music was unbearable.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here after a corporate tour of the Bellagio...try to sit at the chef's table!  SERVICE: Service was excellent  but you really can't expect much else from Bellagio. Everyone was attentive and had great suggestions on what to order.  FOOD: I personally ordered grapefruit juice and the mushroom flatbread pizza. I know that it's almost impossible to do pizza wrong  but they did it SO well! The crust was toasted to perfection  and the chef was definitely not skimpy with mushrooms. *drools*  Will definitely come back again next time I'm in vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I come for the bar and stay for the bartenders.  For as often as I come to Olives  you would think I would have tried the food by now. After walking the strip or chilling in a nearby casino  I usually work up a thirst for a dirty martini. And after sampling a handful around town--and other cities for that matter--Todd's seems to make the best dirty Chopin vodka martini I've ever had. And of course  they've got the good blue cheese olives.  As far as their signature cocktails go  I can vouch that the Southern Sidecar is a masterpiece. However  as the name suggests  it is mixed with Southern Comfort. I'm partial to SC  so I substitute it with the always reliable Crown. Whiskey and ginger beer make just the perfect match don't they? Generally speaking  I don't venture far from Crown or martinis  but one of the bartenders sampled me a fruity  passion fruit vodka-based cocktail whose name escapes me. If you see it on the menu and aren't ashamed to have a pink drink in front of you  order it.   Speaking of bartenders  my faves are Ernie and Zach. I can honestly say they're the nicest  friendliest  and most personable bartenders I've ever met. And once you've been there a few times  they'll remember your face  order  and whatever problems you were discussing that evening. Zach and Ernie have kindly lent me their ear and talked me through a couple of my life troubles while medicating my soul with  martinis. Awesome friends  right?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Took mom to LV for her 70th birthday and when asked where she wanted to go for dinner  replied with ""I really like that place in Bellagio where you can sit outside and watch the fountains."" Guess that narrowed it down a bit!   Arrived a few minutes before our reservation where they confirmed our seating request and then wished mom a happy birthday before leading us outside. Our ""table for two"" along the railing would have been more appropriate for a date but it was exactly what she wanted and gave her a great view of the show for the evening.   The sea bass was excellent (we both ordered that) and everything that came along was well prepared. Our glasses  bar or otherwise  were never empty with service both prompt and professional.   For desert  they brought out a ""mini-tray"" with happy birthday written in chocolate  timed perfectly with the fountains erupting. Well  I think that timing was luck but made her evening.   I forgot to mention to mom that a Pimms Cup is not just lemonade  Spite and a cucumber but gets its name from a liquor. These hit the spot but it wasn't until her second  when I joked about needing to pace ourselves  that she was ""really enjoying"" the fountains.    I honestly can't tell you the price other than it wasn't Bradley Ogden expensive or Denny's cheap. There are some meals you don't look at the bottom line and this was one of them."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Dined with a group  but had to be split up. :( Had reservations  but were seated more than half an hour late.  But! Most all of my reviews are specifically about the FOOD.    Assorted Bread w/ both Green & Black Olive Tapenade. Portobello Flatbread. Fig & Prosciutto Flatbread. Carpetbagger Oysters. Seafood Risotto. North Atlantic Sea Scallops.  *Extra star for bread  tapenade and flatbread.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had dinner here the day after Christmas. We made reservations 2 weeks before since the restaurant gets booked pretty quickly.  We were seated at a decent table inside for 8 people. Outdoor seating was available but it seemed too cold to sit outside.  The service was very slow but then again it allowed us to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant and watch the Bellagio fountain show.   I ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread which was delish! I loved the thinness and crispness of the flatbread. The blue cheese was the right amount and the fig was the perfect complement for the prosciutto. I definitely recommend trying the flatbreads.   Overall it was a good experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Outstanding lunch!  Pasta and salads were fresh  flavorful  and well-seasoned.  Sat outside  and while it was cool here in January  the patio heaters made it comfortable.  Service was great  and we enjoyed a nice wine from the quite interesting list.   Definitely would go back.  Patio overlooks fountains as well  but food kept out attention!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you can sit outside on the tiny patio  do it! You'll enjoy great views of the water show and a cute atmosphere.  HOWEVER  the food sucks. The chicken gnocchi tasted sweet and super gummy. The halibut was over cooked. I'm all about big spending for a great  authentic  delicious Italian meal  but this wasn't it. The bread before dinner was the best part of the meal.   Go here for a drink/appetizer and to enjoy views of the fountain  but skip dinner and head somewhere else.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is and has always been my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas.  Whether you are holed up at the bar solo feasting on fresh baked focaccia with two delicious olive spreads and a dirty martini or having a romantic evening with your partner watching the Bellagio Fountains erupting overhead  you can't go wrong with this consistent restaurant.  Don't miss the flat breads and the dirty martini (vodka) stuffed with two blue cheese olives and a sprig of rosemary.  Love this place!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good lunch place if you are at the Bellagio. Nice salad and flat breads. Friendly staff and comfortable restaurant for conversations with friends. Located kind far in the hotel half way through the shopping mall.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Went to dinner here on Saturday night. We had a reservation  but we still had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated.   We were sat outside  which is great real estate because this place overlooks the fountains. However  it's also December. We are local and we've seen it. I would have gladly given up my view of the Bellagio fountains to not sit in 45 degree weather. I just found it odd that we were sat outside and not asked if this was okay with us. Again  it's cold outside and plenty of spots were available inside.  Their drink menu is on an iPad which is kind of a hassle. Their ""cocktail"" section is only martinis save for one drink. Unless I just couldn't figure out the program  seems like their mixed drink menu could use some more selection. Not everyone wants a martini with 3 tbsp of alcohol in it for $16 or a $300 bottle of wine.  We were brought a bread basket and poured water pretty quickly after being sat... And then we waited  and waited  and waited some more. We easily sat there for 15 minutes watching our waiter whirl around the other tables and not even stop by to introduce herself as our server. I started to think that we were supposed to use the iPad to order like you are expected to do with the alcohol.  Eventually the waitress came over and from there on  the service was fine. The food was good but the menu is small and limited.  WARNING: when sitting on the terrace at night  expect to be caught in the middle of a constant traffic flow of inconsiderate people coming outside to take pictures  stand RIGHT OVER your table to watch the fountain show  and other rude BS you shouldn't have to deal with when paying at least $100 for dinner.  BIGGER WARNING: Someone comes around to take your picture and it costs $70.00 for two pictures in a Bellagio souvenir photo booklet. Don't get guilted in to buying the photos because they know you can afford it. Just say no before they even take the picture and avoid the awkward sales pitch at the end of your meal."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great  flavorful food and great service! I have the mushroom pizza and it was something I would definitely go back for! Much better then some of my other Vegas Restaurant experiences.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best meals ever!  Patio seating is a must.  We had water side seats on the patio  and it was just awesome to watch the water-light show at night.  The $20 glasses of wine seemed to disappear so fast! My wife said the bartender  Ernie  made one of the best martinis she has ever had.  We had 3 apps and split a meal.  Fois grois so delectible  tuna tartare melted in your mouth  and the beef carpaccio was to die for.  We wrapped up with some hand rolled gnocchi  wow what a meal!  I recommend making a reservation and arriving an hour early to request patio seating.  No guarantee  but the earlier you get there the better chance of outdoor seating.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this place both here  in NYC  and in Aspen. Todd English is a master at what he does. I almost always have a great meal here  and I like the high energy this place offers. It isn't cheap  but is one of the most affordable options at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives is great. The decor  friendly staff  view of the Bellagio fountains and  most importantly  the food.   I'd read that the complimentary bread here was worth the trip - and it is. It was flavorful and crisp - just the right start to the meal. I had the following:  Crispy Pork Lollipops - I'm not sure what I expected to see  really  but this ended up being the largest app I'd ever had in a restaurant of this quality. While I'd have been fine with half the portion  it is not because it was lacking in any way. The ""lollipops"" ended up being tender ribs with a great flavor.   Salmon en Croute - The pastry was dense enough to handle the salmon  which was cooked perfectly in its shell.   Chocolate Mousse - Beautifully presented. Great consistency and flavor.   I also tried the panna cotta (the panna cotta was actually my original dessert.) which was very mild. I'm not into mild desserts  but my dinner companion was. So  we switched :)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There are loads of restaurants in Vegas. I'd go back to this one  which means it must be at least a 4.  At around noon it was pretty dead so had the pick of the seating  but stayed inside as it was a breezy day in late November. Service was attentive and it was kept up as it got busier over the next hour or so.  Really liked the bread basket with olivey accompaniments  and the entree (a venison special  $20) was great. Had the more expensive of two pinot noirs on the by-the-glass wine list  which was a good choice too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really good food. The sliders were amazing  just a little soggy on the bottom  but great flavor. My scallops were perfectly prepared  same with the risotto  and beautifully presented. Excellent wine and presentation  good service. I would definitely go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'm sorry to say it was a very very disappointing meal.  I booked reservations here almost a month in advance but the only thing worth mentioning was their bread basket.  I had their CRAZY MUSHROOM PAPPARDELLE and MUSHROOM RISOTTO. The pasta was so over boiled that didn't have any chew what so ever.  The dish had more red peppers than it did mushrooms and the sauce was extremely bland and watered down.  To me the risotto wasn't seasoned much either.    The service was friendly to begin with but our waitress soon went missing and another waitress only showed up to bring us our check.  I was really looking forward to our dinner so it was even more disappointing than expected.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I come here every time I come to Vegas.  Their food is good  but the atmosphere is what makes it.    The Bellagio Fountains are my absolute favorite thing in Vegas  so I make a reservation for the patio every time.  They turn the music off on the patio for each and every fountain show and the atmosphere is just magical.    Moral of the story: come to sit on the patio (wait if you have to) and be amazed!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a disappointment! A year ago I ate at Olives and it was wonderful so I made reservations again this trip. NEVER AGAIN.I ordered the butternut squash ravioli in sage sauce  a favorite dish of mine. It was horrible  so horrible I sent my meal back after two bites. I never do that; I can usually scrape off the offending item or eat around it. The whole thing was bad. My friend ordered the halibut with prawns; she said hers wasn't much better. The prawns where over cooked and were cold by the time they were served. The halibut was okay  the only thing keeping her from sending it back.   So why the two stars? The Sommelier was amazing. The wine he chose for us was wonderful.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Bellagio.  Pricey menu.  Celebrity chef.  I thought this was going to be pretty food on tiny plates.  We ordered accordingly.  Boy  was I wrong.    Starter  Grilled Squid and Octopus w/ chickpea vinaigrette.  The ""starter"" was practically a meal for 2.  It was really good though.  The squid was really well cooked.  The octopus could have been a bit more tender but tasted good.  Next we had a flatbread with fig and prosciutto.  The fig component was fig jam and dried fig.  Pretty sweet  but with the prosciutto and cheese  can't recall what kind  i thought it was well balanced.  The GF thought it was just too sweet.  This thing was big too  like a medium pizza.   Pasta  I ordered Sweet Pea Agnolotti.  Again huge portion  but very good.  A little heavy on the cheese.  But the summer vegetable ""matrix"" served with the cheese and vege filled dumplings was satisfying and almost meaty.  Any complaints about this meal are really just nitpicking.  My only real gripe is that I wish our server had told us that we were ordering way too much food."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing location! Sit outside its beautiful! The staff was very attentive and knowledgable made it easy to ask questions. They start you off with fresh super delicious baked bread. We ordered a flatbread pizza and huge steak sandwich both were great. Reasonable prices. Had a mango iced tea that was a special my girlfriend who doesn't like ice tea even liked it. Great place!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"If your looking for ambiance this not the place for you. We made reservations for dinner and made the reservation because we wanted Bellagio Fountain seating. We were told ""first come first served"" our reservation was for 630pm. Much to my disappointment as we walked by several open tables by the fountain we were seated away from what we reserved to be seated as ""first come first served"". We were rushed through dinner so quickly  and as soon as I set my fork down my plate was taken away the basket of complimentary crackers and butter came after dinner and then we asked for the dessert menu. We asked for coffee with dessert which was served room temperature poor poor service. This definitely a place that needs to learn the 2nd Golden Rule. Quality vs. Quantity."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went here to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary primarily on the reputation of the owner - Todd English. Poor choice. Seated in the bar although we requested outdoor seating. Had bar patrons standing over us while dining. Management no where to be found. Server was attentive but spacing between courses was poor. Left to have dessert elsewhere due to length of time to be served and the crowded bar environment.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's worth the experience if you can get one of the few tables outside. Otherwise  the food is meh. I ordered the special braised short rib pasta. There was hardly any short ribs in the pasta  but what appeared was neither tender nor flavorful. The pasta was overcooked. Instead of layers of flavor  all I could taste was garlic.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is a beautiful restaurant and had a good selection of drinks including champagne by the glass. I tried the chicken artichoke flatbread and fig prosciutto flat bread. I was not s fan of the chicken artichoke because of the red pepper flakes but the fjg flatbread was really good. It was expensive for a lunch spot so I'm not sure id be back for lunch.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not really close to what this restaurant claims to be. The flatbread was quite good  but my main dish (lump crab carbonara) was not. The pasta was overcooked  and the sauce was too thin with unbalanced flavors. The service was okay  but nothing special.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives didn't fancy me one bit.. call me unsophisticated  but I would have rather wined and dined at the other Olive.. the one with the ""Garden"" n' all.  The beef carpaccio was good  but I've had better.. The Sirloin Sandwhich tastes like ol' soggy McD's.. The Ricotta Ravioli was flavorless and the Ahi Tuna Block was bland.  Maybe I just came on one of their bad days.. or maybe I still have yet to develop a palate for the finer things in life.  Until then  Chef Boyardee... mmm mmm good!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made an 11am reservation and got there early to guarantee our spot outside overlooking the fountains.  Gorgeous view.  Bread & Tapenade are a nice presentation  and help balance the martini's you should be ordering (they're fantastic).  Having been here before  I ordered the beef carpaccio (app) for my lunch.  It comes on a plate big enough to carve a christmas goose  with a small salad in the middle  highlighted by garlic aioli  scallion cream  balsamic reduction  cipollini onions  and slices of parmesan the size of the cards they use up the hall at the blackjack tables.  Hiding in the middle of the plate is a good sized portion of gorgonzola polenta.  Also enjoyed the Truffle Fries  went well with the gargantuan plate of beef.  My wife ordered the Pulled Short Rib  which was outstanding  but maybe a little too rich and over portioned for lunch.  We both picked at it and finished less than 1/2 the plate.  Great view (we were there on a Saturday  the fountains start going off at noon)  great food.  Service left a little to be desired  but the other two aspects were good enough to make it a non-issue.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really enjoyed this Italian. I started with Boston salad which contains blue cheese and stimulate appetite with sour flavor. Sea scallops is amazing and goes well with other ingredients such as sea bean and mashed potatoes. The server was really nice and friendly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We were in Vegas for the night and we had several friends tell us to go to ""Olives"" at the Bellagio for great Italian food.  I mean  there are tons of restaurants along the strip that are probably amazing  right?!  But since we were recommended to eat here  we did  and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  After hitting up Little Italy in NYC  this Italian food did not quite step up to the plate when it came to the sauces  but other than that...the bread here are fantastic and the olive dipping sauce was very tasty.....we ate so much bread that night and lots of olives.  Yay to carbs and monounsaturated fats!!!  I ended up getting a flatbread pizza with basil and tomato...so fresh and tasty and my hubby had a pasta dish with sausage  which was fantastic.  We had a nice romantic seat by the window  so we could see the Bellagio fountains.  Unfortunately the night was very windy....they had to shut off the fountains!  :(  oh well.    Definitely would go again  but since there are so many restaurants to sample in Vegas...next time we would probably venture out."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I just had lunch here with my parents  wow  quite an experience. I actually didn't know that Todd English was of the celebrity chef caliber and perhaps that's why I was all the more impressed.  It's not an inexpensive meal but I'd recommend a few things (again only ate lunch here): the turkey reuben is delish  especially the fried pickles it comes with; the butternut squash is another winner  and any of the flatbreads are meals in themselves.  If you can bear the heat - and they do have water misters - try and sit outside for a gorgeous view from the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The bar is very well appointed and the bartenders know their cocktails. For dinner I ordered the beef tenderloin and it was one of the best I have had. Highly recommend.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent drinks. Great bartenders. Great wait staff. Nice view of the fountains.  The grilled squid and octopus appetizer was a little chewey though.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives in the Bellagio is a delightful destination for a relaxing evening of fine dining.  Though they made a point of their ""business casual"" dress code when we made our reservation  no one seemed to mind our casual appearance.  The menu is meat-tastic  so I said I was vegan and asked them to make me something without mushrooms.  I got the most ridiculously large plate of veggies.  My blackberry crush was disgusting; when I told the waiter he was so polite about it and brought me a fresh one which had no bitter after taste.  The decor is dark and laden with candles.  I would certainly dine here again."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the best meal we had in Vegas  by far. Maybe it was because we tried to go to 2 other places prior that were either closed or had a long wait and we were just hungry  but I'm going to venture that it was actually just that good.  The hostess seated us semi-promptly by Vegas standards and they had a pretty full house. Our waiter was friendly  engaged us in conversation (but not too much)  and was willing to give suggestions.  First of all  I have to gush about the olive tapenade they serve with the bread basket - OMG! As a lover of all things olive  I would go back just for this.   I started off with a tropical martini concoction. I can't even remember what was in it (pineapple juice?)  but it was really yummy and had the perfected sugar rim. But it was also $14. Yikes.  Since we were starving (it was 11 pm our 'home' time)  we ordered the prosciutto and fig flatbread. It was simply delicious. It had whole figs  and COVERED in prosciutto. Toppings tended to fall off as you took a bite  but it was still delicious.  I had the Chicken and Gnocchi and it was really good. The chicken wasn't as well prepared as the gnocchi and sauce  but overall it was really good. The downside was the flatbread was so large and the olive spreads were so good  I was full by time I got my entree.  One thing I will say is a downside is it is a little pricey for what we got - 1 flatbread  2 pasta entrees (one with sausage and mine had chicken)  and a drink each and it was nearly $150 with tax and tip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Had a great lunch here on July 3.  The view of the Bellagio dancing waters is amazing  the service was superb and my sliders were delicious with terrific shoe-string fries.  The only downside was the bread - it was dry as dust.  So bad  that a mouthful could make a person gag or quickly reach for a glass of water. I wish I could give 5 stars but one of my ""musts"" for 5 is great bread!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I gave Olives a 4 for the excellent food and wine.    The atmosphere is really noisy which made it hard to have a conversation.  The waiter we had was competent  but tended to not know his stuff.  I ordered the steak with the green beans.  I usually focus on the steak  but with this meal  the green beans.  They prepare the green beans with an interesting tempura style.  The deep frying with the batter made the beans taste phenomenal.  Three of us at the table had the steak and green beans and all of us finished the green beans.  Oh yeah  the steak with the wine sauce was pretty good too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,3.5 stars for food  4 stars if the fountains were on when I came.   FOOD Complimentary bread and dip (4 stars): The bread variety was great. The spreads are all olive spreads  really good if you're an olive fan  if not  you're out of luck.   Margarita Chicken Sandwich (3.5 stars): Juicy chicken  not amazing flavors but pretty good. Needed more basil.   Spicy Chicken Flat bread (3.5 stars): Needed more flavor too  but still good. Not as crunchy on the bottom of the pizza  but the crust was crunchy.   Cookie Sandwich Sundae (3.5 stars): Actually pretty small compared to the picture they show you! But good when it's so hot out outside! We asked to do both vanilla ice cream sandwiches and they did it. Good ice cream  good cookie.   Complimentary Cream Puffs for special occasions: So nice they gave something for a special occasion. Who ever they have writing in chocolate is so talented  looked perfect.   VIEW (4 stars): With the fountains on it would definitely be a 5 star experience! We came on a weekday at 12:30PM for lunch and got a seat outside. I was waiting for the fountains until the waitress told me they don't turn on till 3PM on weekdays. WHATTTT  why am I here? Well it was still pretty to sit outside near the water and see the view of the strip  but the reason I came here was for those damn fountains  a little disappointing. So come after 3PM on weekdays!   SERVICE (4 stars): At first when they took us outside on the patio for seating they had 2 tables open  one with partial shade  the other in the over 100 degree heat. They need to fix the umbrellas to cover all the tables more  how can you eat in that heat! We ended up scrunching into the partial shaded table. But everyone was nice. Our waters were always filled  the waitress was a little chatty with certain tables so you had to wait till she was done to ask for stuff  but other than that everything was good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I had our wedding dinner at Olives one year ago 1/1/15  and it was spectacular. Valentin  the manager  went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of and we had an amazing wedding dinner with our friends and family. As a result  we were back this year!  Well  last night Valentin and our server Michelle again went above and beyond to welcome us and make sure that everything was perfect! Both were so considerate and helpful  and Michelle's food recommendations did not steer us wrong.  I got the Agnolotti  and while small  it was delicious. My wife got the pulled chicken & artichoke flatbread which she liked  but did not love (she did not ask Michelle for a recommendation haha).  Valentin and Michelle sent out the cheesecake as their dessert pick and it was wonderful! They wrote happy anniversary on it  and it truly made the night special.  If we're in Vegas next year on our 2nd Anniversary  we want to keep this tradition alive! With such welcoming and warming people like Valentin and Michelle  it really makes you feel comfortable trusting the restaurant to such a special night. Thank you both!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Got to eat at Olives a few weeks ago.  Made reservation in advance no problem.  Read other reviews about balcony seating not being able to be reserved in advance went there a bit before reservation time to request outdoor seating.  Was told it would be about 2.5 hours later.  Was in no hurry and not that hungry at that time so no problem.  Came back just under 2 hours later to check status and they were able to seat us right then.  Balcony has a couple of seats along the railing that are 2 and/or 4 person size.  There are a couple larger tables in the middle and a few seats alone the doors away from the fountain.  Was seated near the door which wasn't a issue since you still have good view of the fountain shows.  Wasn't very familiar with the portion size so me and my friend were going to split 2 flatbreads and each order an entree.  Server quickly told us that would be too much food so we just got 1 flatbread.  The server was right  there was plenty of food between the app and entree.  In fact  was so full didn't order dessert.  Got the mushroom flatbread and the gnocchi with duck.  Both were really good.  Gnocchi dish may have been over-sauced a bit.  It had good flavor and was an enormous portion.    Given the price point and it being on the strip in Vegas this place might even be considered a ""bargain"".  I would recommend but get here on the early side to get your outdoor seating and don't be surprised if you have to wait."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I are starting to run out of nice restaurants we haven't yet visited here in Vegas  we decided to try Olives for Valentine's Day despite the previous so-so reviews from trusted Yelpers. We were treated to a very strange evening with mediocre food.  Service: It started when we arrived 9 minutes later for our 9.15 reservation. We were made to wait almost 10 minutes before being seated  which would have been fine if the restaurant was busy or full  but there were dozens of empty tables. The service after that was like a drive-by; the waiter came by and asked if we wanted bottled or regular water then sprinted away  came back and asked for our drink order then sprinted away  etc. All of the bussers and servers apparently had all been trained in the same fashion  to speak quickly and abruptly  then sprint away. Plates clanked loudly on the tablecloth-less table as they were all but tossed onto the table. Well  at least I can't complain about the service being slow or inefficient  Food: in general  everything we ordered was smothered in sauce  making it impossible to taste any of the actual food itself. This was true of the carpaccio  gnocchi  and pork chops. The four slices of duck included with the gnocchi was very gamey - and this coming from a girl who loves lamb and other meats that live on the edge of gamey.   In all  this was a very blah date night experience  and I probably won't be back any time soon.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went here with 20 relatives for my father's birthday. It was quite good. I had a filet and sampled many other entrees and appetizers. The drinks were good. Like most restaurants on the Strip  the waitstaff was very mechanical and unenthusiastic  but they were very efficient. My niece (and I) enjoyed running out to see the water show every 30 minutes. They sang and brought out a piece of cake.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went for a late dinner reservation 9pm  as many other reviewers seemed to have a better experience later in the evening. We had requested to sit outside  but were told it would be hours more to wait for a table outside  so we sat inside. Our server was fine  but we were near some kind of server station and on two separate occasions glasses were dropped and flying pieces of glass came all around us  not quite the atmosphere you would expect from a nice restaurant  one server even asked for our help to find the broken pieces of glass. The food was unremarkable. We started with a Fig & Prosciutto flat bread  which was fine but nothing special. I had the salmon which was by far the best main course at our table  however it was drenched in butter so it was very rich and I could not finish it. The butternut squash tortellini was shaped nothing like tortellini but more like cannelloni and lacked taste completely.I don't even remember what the men at the table had. The also had a photographer going around the restaurant snapping pictures  which reminded me of a cheesy cruise ship. The photographer was asking $45 for the pictures she took and rolled her eyes when we said we were not interested. I also saw the photographer run out of the restaurant and down the shopping plaza after a couple who had finished their dinner  but apparently not seen their picture yet! The whole photographer situation seemed odd and left a bad taste in my mouth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was good. We ordered Salmon and Steak and end up with Coconut Cake. Service is attentive. Definitely come back when we visit Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've heard about Olives for years and finally came here for my girl's Bachelorette dinner. This is her favorite place in vegas and now I understand why! Amazing food with amazing view!  We reserved the window side table with the view of the bellagio fountain! It was absolutely a stunning view with the fountain in the background while you dine!  Must try: - Beef carpaccio - I'm a sucker for carpaccio. This carpaccio definitely is number 1 on my list! Gorgonzola rosti cake at the bottom of the thin sliced huge pieces of tender beef  perfect amount of parmesan cheese  cipollini onions with the touch of balsamic reduction. HUGE portion! - Tuna tartare - it's not my favorite  the portion is much smaller. it's refreshing but too gingery for my taste.   - Crazy mushroom pappardelle - 4 of our party ordered the same pasta! That should tell you something! king trumpet  shiitake  oyster & crimini mushrooms  english peas  piquillo peppers parmesan cream  truffle essence  lemony pea shoots... truffle makes this pasta so much more flavorful (yes  I'm a truffle person  I mean  who isn't?!) - Sea Scallops - truffle whipped yukon potatoes  sauteed sea beans  cabernet reduction. The scallops are almost palm sized  the truffle whipped potatoes are delicious with the delicate scallops. The sea beans are top of the scallops are very interesting  never had it before but it adds a crunch/texture to the dish! - chocolate hazelnut souffle  - we were told that the portion is small  it's actually decent for everyone to have a few bites! It is delicious! perfectly puffed up souffle with creamy chocolate hazelnut inside. Who wouldn't love it?  Service - we had an amazing service  even though they were really busy but our waitress was super attentive and kind :)  We watched about 5-6 times of the fountain show  it doesn't get old at all! 5 stars for the food  the view and the experience! Hope you will have the same experience we did!   Bon appetit! xoxo
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view and ambiance is great! I loved it!  I ordered a pear and beat salad with Salmon for my lunch. Wasn't the greatest salad but wasn't terrible. The view makes this restaurant happen.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is a great spot for lunch. Recently  while on a business trip  I snuck in for a quick little lunch at the bar. On a 100+ degree Las Vegas summer day  the watermelon  heirloom tomato  and feta salad paired perfectly with a crisp Sauvignon Blanc that the bartender suggested. I will definitely be back to try a flatbread!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I am a big fan of this place. The food is always perfect and the view of the fountains stunning. But even though all four of us loved our meal  I think I had a better experience last time. Granted I chose rack of lamb for my dinner  I thought that this time there was a lack of imagination on the menu. With everything is see and the imagination of chef's around the country  I didn't particularly see a dish on the menu that would blow me away. Last time I had a duo of rabbit and duck and it was absolutely amazing. I'm sure I will end up here again and enjoy another fantastic meal soon enough. It's truly a great place to eat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was attracted to Olives because of Todd English is a world-renowned  and respected chef.  Olives being one of his flagship restaurants  I expected my culinary experience to be somewhat of nirvana.    So  I ordered a dish that is pretty difficult to make good  knowing that if I had it here it would be perfection.  I ordered the sea scallops.  And  I must say  that I was a bit disappointed.  The dish was a bit unpleasant looking.  At first  I attributed this to the lighting (it is really dark for dinner); but then I took a picture of my dish and truly it was unpleasant looking.  In terms of taste  the scallops were a bit tough and rubbery and the combination of tastes were not at all complimentary.    Perhaps it was because the chef at the helm that day/season lacked passion and this translated to dishes that looked quite tired.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The restaurant is located in the Via Bellagio Shops across from Tiffany & Co and next to Louis Vuitton. If you're lucky enough to get outdoor seating  you will have a fantastic view of the backside of the Bellagio fountains if it's during the show. Since it often gets busy here  I recommend getting reservations. There are no restrooms inside the restaurant  but there is one located next to Tiffany & Co.

Crust had the oven brick baked taste to it. I had the Ricotta Ravioli. I was afraid there would be sun-dried tomatoes but the waiter was nice enough to verify with the chef whether or not there was any in the dish. Very bold flavors  I really enjoyed the dish. Our friends thoroughly enjoyed their dishes as well.  Since nearly everyone was still hungover  we all opted for a cup of coffee to end the meal. It was on the weak side :(  Service was very attentive. Plates were quickly cleared and glasses/cups were constantly refilled. Napkins were also folded when someone stepped away from the table."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had no idea it was restaurant week when I visited the Las Vegas strip for the first time over Labor Day. I found myself waiting on a long line for the acclaimed  Bellagio buffet saying "" $#@% this"" I'm starving. I remember my chef had recommended Todd English's Olives as a restaurant to dine at while in Vegas. My buddy and I decided to try it out and was glad we did. We both chose different items off the restaurant week lunch pre-fix menu. Grilled shrimp cocktail and BBQ riblets to start. Followed by Steak Frites and pan-seared white fish. Dessert was a vanilla semi-fredo and sorbet trio. There is no dress code at this joint but it is classy for sure. If you can get a table outside on the patio/balcony thing that over looks the fountains  TAKE IT! I was surprised to hear the foundation show go off mid way through our meal and made the experience that much more epic! Service was great and they worked like a team. Managers  servers  runners/bussers alike. I recommend this for everyone who visits the strip."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We stopped by Olives around 6pm without a reservation hoping for a spot on the patio. The hostess informed is the earliest we could get out there would be 8:45 but she could get us a table by the window. We obliged.  About 5 minutes later  we were seated and on the way to the table  the head hostess told the one seating us to bring us to the patio. Awesome. Things are starting off well.  We ended up with a great table close to the fountains and ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread (per our servers recommendation) for an appetizer. Between that and the bread basket with olive tapenade they serve  we were practically full by the time our entrees were served. The flatbread was good but not mind blowing.  Our entrees were superb though: my husband had the tenderloin and crabcake and I had a striped bass special. His tenderloin was cooked perfectly and he could cut it with a fork. The bass was fantastic- perched above a bed of risotto with peas and lump crab meat. I was so full from our bread basket overindulgence but couldn't stop eating it.  The fountains played a few times while we were out there and the looky-Lou's that come on the patio to watch/take pics/etc is a bit annoying. Food and ambience would score this place a 5 but I had to take off a star for two reasons: 1. The table next to us was a young family- 30 something couple with their two kids- probably 18 months and 4. The baby screamed the entire time. Being parents of an almost two year old ourselves  I understand that dinners out can be challenging. Which is why you couldn't pay me to take my kid to a place like this. I am super conscious of those around me when my daughter is cranky and I was disappointed that these parents weren't the same way. Definitely put a damper on our ""romantic"" evening and I was surprised the olives staff didn't say something but understand that's a tough position for them.  Second- I could tell the waiter was irritated we weren't drinking (my husband had a beer but I stuck to water as I had a few cocktails while we were gambling prior to dinner) and that we skipped on dessert (which we usually order but were so full). I get it. Waiters want you to order booze because bigger bill=bigger tip. I could have done without the snotty ""sticking with water huh?"" Comment though.  Pretty minimal but those things did detract from a 5 star experience.  Awesome food though and we will go back."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is our favorite restaurant in Las Vegas! If you can handle a wait for a patio table (or get there just before they open)  DO IT! So lovely to dine next to the fountains. My advice is to have a big  late breakfast (buffet anyone?)  skip lunch (or have a snack) and hit Olives as soon as they open at 5:00 to snag an outside table. You'll be able to walk off dinner  or hit a show. Then you'll be just hungry enough to have another snack somewhere before calling it a night.   The service is always top notch. Before appetizers  a love duo of olive tapenade (with some whole olives in between) is delivered to the table. We always order the beef carpaccio. It's HUGE and delicious. On our last trip  I was pregnant  so I couldn't enjoy the carpaccio  but watched my husband devour it with fury. The steak is great  but my favorite entree are the scallops with mushroom risotto. We ordered the peanut butter lava cake for dessert last time  and while it was truly delectable  it was a bit rich and could have used a scoop of ice cream or gelato.   The sommelier  Tammie  is also fantastic. We have yet to have a disappointing experience here and will continue to make reservations for as long as we are visiting Vegas.  Go. You won't regret it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"A two person $180 bill for Cheesecake Factory experience with bad service?  Brutally bad  which I never expected.    (One star because of expectations based on price point and location.)  What do they sell here - heavily?  THE VIEW.  So  what are you paying for here?  THE VIEW.  The food is almost second.  On their website  what do they show you?  THE VIEW.  They show pictures and pictures of the gorgeous views of the fountains.  Um  you're not sitting by the fountains - not even close and they're super snobby about it  like there's some secret way to get it.  It's bait and switch because you literally have no chance of getting that view here at dinner... yet  that's their main selling point (and people who get it stay longer than two hours).  We checked in at 6:45 and they saw it notated that I requested the fountain view.  The hostess (who never smiled once)  knowing it was requested in my reservation  callously said it would be another two hours if we wanted that  knowing we were there for a 6:45 dinner and  what  we're just going to walk around for two hours?  Then I would have made a 4:45 reservation  if that was the case.  Instead... what view did we get?  The view of the planter in the back corner  and windows with drapes blocking any kind of view through the umbrellas outside.  We were laughing about how bad of a view it was.  (I'm attaching a picture in this review.)    I hate to keep harping on it because  with sitting near a view of ANY kind  this place just looks exactly like the Cheesecake Factory decor.  If I want to a Cheesecake Factory experience  I would have gone there for 1/3 of the price... for the same views and probably better food.  We were also laughing because of how loud it was  as we were by some interior waiter station  clanging cups and broken glasses... the soundtrack for the little bit of the fountain we could kind see.  Also  I was completely over-dressed with a suit and no tie.  People are in here with shorts and t-shirts.  What!?  There's no jacket policy?  Or  at least a collared shirt?  It's farm town tourist central here.  I expected this to be along the lines of SW Steakhouse and it's not even close  as far as class.     Our waitress was awful.  Just an older lady who tried covering up a bad attitude with a teeth-gritting fake smile.  Her lack of knowledge of the menu was astonishing.  We asked about a couple wines and if it was dry or sweet or whatever and she just kinda repeated what we were saying  like  it can't be both.  Any other place  the waiter/waitress would have brought out a couple samples.  Not with her.   The food.  I ordered a Greek salad and gnocchi  with a Riesling.  The bread and olives were great... I love olives and they have various kinds and spreads.  All great.  The salad was good  again  with olives.  The entree of the gnocchi?  Sloppy mess. Dry  overcooked chicken.  Soupy.  Random mess.  I ate half of it then just gave up.  Brutal.  How do you screw up gnocchi?     Kind of sad when the bread and spread far exceeds the entree.    The only thing upscale about this place is price point... nothing else justifies it.  It is NOT a ""fine"" dining experience.  Trust me  if you want a nice night out... go to ANYTHING at the Wynn because you what you ""think"" you're getting here... is exactly what you get there.  I've been to a number of places there and all were great  especially with the water view.  Just a different vibe  better service  etc.  The ONLY reason to come here would be the view and there's apparently some super secret way to get it... which I do not know of.    Obviously I had  what I assume to be  an ""outlier"" experience  basically  the worst possible experience one could have but I'd never risk giving it another shot... so there won't be a follow-up review.  I've seen enough."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just came back from a few days in Vegas.  I ate Italian three out of four nights.  RAO'S and OLIVES were the best nights  even though each serves entirely different Italian cuisine.  RAO'S is NYC good ol' school  where OLIVES is fusion post-modern 'fancy' Italian.    You have to be an amazing chef to reinvent a cuisine.  Lobster Pumpkin Bisque  Crab Beignets  two different salads  the swordfish  Beef Carpaccio  and Butternut Squash Tortelli richer than any cheesecake.   There wasn't a bad plate on the table  and in fact -- everything was amazing.  I am irked by celebrity chefs but I'm a believer of Todd now.   This isn't a place to simply feed an appetite.  This is the type of place you'd dream about holding a wedding reception.  Kinda cramped quarters  sure  but the view of the Bellagio fountain creates the 'illusion' of space.  Once you can forgive the exorbitant bill that unfortunately can/will/must arrive -- what can I say -- this is one of the finest meals I've ever witnessed in or out of Vegas.  And the Bellagio blended red wine wasn't topped in four nights -- and believe me my dining mates tried.  Worth going back to just for this.  Five stars.  No hesitation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,After making reservations before we arrived in Vegas  and travelling to other hotels to eat  we happened into Olives (staying at the Bellagio) because we didn't feel like going any further that evening.  We didn't have reservations but found 2 places at the bar.  They serve a full menu at the bar.  Service was fantastic  and food was excellent.  I had Chilean sea bass on mushroom risotto  and I've thought of it since!  My husband had Beef Carpaccio and was just as pleased as I was.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food and flavors and an excellent dining experience. Olive burger was great  very flavorfull and cooked to a perfect mid rare. It was a little busy but did not wait long and received good service. Only dislike was it felt like we were being rushed towards the end of our dining experience. Wasnt offered or asked if we wanted dessert and actually had to ask for dessert menu but definitely worth it.  I will definitely be back...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great restaurant!  Chose it because we have been to Todd English's restaurant in Charlestown (Boston) many years ago and loved it.  Great atmosphere.  Great food.  Worth the visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We travel to Vegas often and when we do  we go to Olives for the Beef Carpaccio. It is consistently delicious and melt in your mouth memorable. The menu changes seasonally and never disappoints. Great wine by the glass options and great service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best meals in Vegas! Recommend: Grilled Midwestern ribeye $61  was one of the best steaks I've had in my life (Morton's Cajen steak is still the best). It melted in my mouth and was so big I couldn't finish. Potatoes were okay.  They serve Hoshizaki ice (worlds most perfect ice)  so my grey goose and pineapple cocktail tasted great. Vegas water tastes awful  so having ice that melts slowly and that eliminates containments makes for a better tasting drink. Sea bass was also highly recommended by my co-worker. Will visit again if in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is the yelp review.  I'm going to follow up with a handwritten (not typed  a major concession for this geek) letter thanking them.  I've eaten at Olives every time I'm in Vegas since I found the place.  Usually lunch  occasionally dinner.  My wife and I enjoy the flatbread pizzas and the tapanade.  She really likes the Pink Limon they no longer have on the menu  but make for her (+1 star)  They also have seating indoors We take the time and sit on the terrace to watch the water ballet.  Very enjoyable to be chatting and nibbling  then pause for a few minutes to watch the fountains.  (+1 star).  Now to the reason they're getting a handwritten letter.  Last night was a special occasion for us  and the maitre'd  Angel  made a significant effort to ensure everything was incredible.  He seated us on the terrace  but away from the rail.  This allowed us to see the ballet  yet was warmer and out of the wind - it's 65 degrees here in Vegas today  so it CAN get cold at night.  He did this with a few other couples  showing an above average attention to detail (+1 star).  I snuck out after we ordered dinner (fig and prosciutto flatbread  prime rib special - both awesome +1 star) to talk to him about a special dessert for my wife.  He bounced a few ideas off me  then brought in a backup to save us both.  (+1 star) Llena came up with a wonderful passage to write on the plate  then served us each a glass of champagne.  It took some time to write it all  but when it came it was perfect!  (+2 stars  dammit - won't go that high)  We had gone to Picasso the night before  but enjoyed this far more. We'll be back as soon as we land at McCarran again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I ate at Olive's in NYC and gave it 2 stars but the LV-Olives is even worse! Our waiter was retarded: he messedup the order at least 3 times. He was so confused. We ordered the flat bread and it came with no cheese and it wasnt cooked. WTF? What a big disappointment. Once again  nice decor  okay service and good drinks = big bill. im dont like these ""new-American"" eateries. The food is so dull every time."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great little restaurant in the middle of the shops at the Bellagio. The wait was about 15 mins to get a table but we decided to just sit at the bar instead. Our bartender Jonathan was awesome. Very friendly and quick. I had the Chicken Margarita Sandwich with Sweet Potato fries. AMAZ-ING! The basil aioli and tomato fondue really made the sandwich! The Pear Two Martini was so so tasty too! I could barely taste the alcohol  even though I know there was plenty in there! The olive tapenades that you get are delicious. I could almost just get drinks and snack on that to be completely satisfied!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great dinner.  I walked in without reservations on a Sunday at 6:30 pm and was seated in a few minutes.  All the restaurants near the casino had waiting lines but not this one--maybe because it's a little removed  down the hall where the retail stores are.  Service was excellent.  The server warned me that I was about to order too much food and made some suggestions about the menu.  The bread basket was fresh and warm and the olive and olive spread hit the spot.  The manager was constantly walking around making sure everything was okay.  Reminded me of a pit boss.  The atmosphere was just right--busy but not too loud.  You can see the water fountain show out the window if you're facing the right way.  I had the Caesar's salad and the ravioli with sweet sausage  both delicious.  Finished with ice cream and cookies desert and hot tea.  Total bill including one cocktail and tip:  $82.  Not cheap but then none of the restaurants in the hotel are unless you belly up to the buffet.  I left stuffed and happy.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice atmosphere and friendly attentive bar tenders. We did not eat dinner this time because the restaurant was booked but we decided to hang at the bar for a bit. The bread and olive spread is delicious! I tried the gnocchi on a previous visit and am looking forward to having it again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the best places for brunch in Vegas.  Starting off with the bread  it's so good that it's hard to stop eating....by the time your meal comes  you will already be almost full from the bread & olive spread.  There's also a thin  Parmesan crisp that has a nice spice kick in certain bites.    The beef & chicken kabob is delish...the portion is rather small...but each bite is packed full of flavor.  Order this starter...you won't be disappointed.  For flatbreads  we ordered the fig & prosciutto..which was only ok.  I found the fig to be a bit overpowering.  Will have to try another flatbread in the future to compare and update the review....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My favorite restaurant in one of my favorite restaurant cities!  Many people come here for the Fountains  and if you can snag a patio table (be prepared for a wait-- possibly worth every minute) you will have an unforgettable experience for sure.   But I come here for the food and I have never been disappointed. Get the flatbread. It's the best pizza you will ever eat.   The Caesar is always excellent. The specials are always creative and enticing. I could itemize everything I have ever ordered here  but it will better serve simply to say: not only have I never had a less-than-superb meal here  I have never had a less than excellent dish here.   Oh  and get the flatbread. Really.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had the ahi tuna special  tuna carpaccio  and fig prosciutto flatbread. The fig flatbread is outstanding. If you don't like extreme cold and are seated against the wall screen exposed to the mall's a/c vent  ask to be moved away from it. The a/c blows directly onto these tables. Oh  and there is a nice view of the fountains here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We made a reservation about a week ahead for a large party of 15.  They put us in two separate tables... HUH?  Minus 1 star  Then we waited by the bar until they could find one large table.... and about 3 drinks later we were seated.... UGH Minus 1 star.  then we ordered and our food came and HOLY BEJESUS ITS SO DELICIOUS that I forgot I was annoyed.  If you have somewhere to be (like a show) don't eat here.  If you don't have a show to go to... EAT HERE!!! EAT HERE EVERYDAY!!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were seated outside. Great view. Service ok. Quality of food ok. Even though my steak sat on the counter for a while before it made it to my table. Drink menu very good  and pricy. Would I go back? Maybe.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,STAY AWAY FROM THE CHILEAN SEABASS !!  It was overcooked and dry all around the edges.  Only the very center was tender and moist like you know this particular fish should be.   My server offered to replace it  but it had taken 30 minutes for the dish to come out and I didn't have another 30 minutes to spare since I my conference was in 20 min.  Hands down the most horrible violation of Chilean seabass preparation.  Cook should be fired.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service here is great. The food is beautiful and delicious.   I just don't want to wait two hours after my reservation  or show up two hours early for it. Especially when I make reservations a month in advance.   Maybe consider opening up for breakfast to accommodate more people and that gorgeous view?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I absolutely loved the place - of course I liked it the minute I got there because of the view! My husband and I made a reservation for the day after Christmas and requested for a patio seat. Luckily we did not have to wait long for one after we arrived. We must have seen the Bellagio fountains firing up at least 10 times during our dinner and every time it felt like I was watching it for the first time. It was a chilly night but the view service and food more than made up for it.  We were given a bread basket (lavash  focaccia and some sweet bread) along with a trio of olives and tapenade upon sitting. I could gorge on those all night but we had to save our appetite for later. Being vegetarian  we ordered the one veggie pasta they had on the menu (butternut squash ravioli) and the eggplant flatbread to share. The flatbread was super yummy and though it did not look too big it pretty much filled our stomachs up before the pasta arrived. This was good because we did not like the pasta dish all that much - it was bit too sweet for our tastes.  The service was extremely friendly - special mention to the guy who refilled our waters. He was attentive friendly and kept making sure that we were comfortable in the chill of the night (they have outdoor heaters but I chose to sit near the fountain where they didnt have any).  The check for 2 for the food came to about 60 bucks. A little pricey but so worth it. Will definitely return the next time I'm in vegas (maybe for desserts since we didnt try any this time).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made a reservation for Valentine's Day 2013 via email with the help of Olive's general manager  Kendra Arroyo.   I was impressed her quick replies and courteousness throughout the back and forth communication.  The highlight of eating at this restaurant is the patio seating with a view of the Bellagio Fountains  but I was told by Kendra  that patio seating is not guaranteed until the day of the reservation.  Ok  fair enough.  We got to the restaurant about 30 minutes early and was told by the host to stand in line to the side for patio seating privileges.  Luckily  we got there 30 minutes early!  The line was out the door by the time our 7pm reservation came around!  We got patio primo seating!  Watching the water danced to the music was beautiful. Better than standing with the hoi polloi on LV Blvd.  :) Service was exceptional.  Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. Wine list was presented on an iPad.  A sommelier was walking around and ready to answer all your wine questions.  Food was excellent  despite the small portions.  A definite must is you're in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Tres tres decue par ce restaurant qui se veut haut de gamme face aux fontaines du Bellagio. Diner tres quelconque voire mauvais nos plats sont arrives froid  les prix son exorbitants pour la qualite et le service est assez desagreable  le but etant de vous ejecter au plus vite de votre table. Le point positif est d'assister toutes les demis heures aux spectacles des fontaines du Bellagio !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had a great holiday meal there.  It was very good. The best duck that I have ever had  and I love duck and have it a lot.  My major problem  and really only one  is that it is ridiculously overpriced.  If it wasn't so overpriced I would go a lot more.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,favorite dish is the  FIG & PROSCIUTTO with the gorgonzola cheese
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For a most delicious fig and prosciutto flatbread  top notch wine list  mouth watering bellini martinis- you must try Olives- Bellagio! The pasta dishes are abundant and delicious- the grilled octopus/squid dish is not to be missed. Try to sit at Gray's tables  on the outside deck  for a most enjoyable dining experience.  The staff  especially Gray  make the experience at Olives very pleasant to say the least. The water show is not to be missed- Take the opportunity to have this experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overpriced  crowded  poor service and the food....nah!  Took my gf for a nice lunch  they told me 1 1/2 hour wait but 30 minutes for outside seating... waited for the outside but waited 10 minutes and we got a table inside (?).  One glass of wine  light beer  hamburger with no bun and a chicken salad $75!!!!!! The worse (what irritates me) is that the service was poor  asked for mayonnaise but they don't have it  aioli ok... never came nor the server came to ck in us. The salad and hamburger nothing special so a waste of time and money.  Not coming back even if I get invited and is free.... much better places on the strip than this....tata for ever!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good food but made us wait 15 minutes longer than our reservation time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The lychee blossom martini was to die for! Ordered the duck foigrass and it was yummy! As a main dish ossobucco   good flavor but a little too salty.   We found it very busy and noisy  I guess we were looking for a more quite spot.   Service was friendly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This meal SHOULD have been better.  Don't get me wrong  it was good... but the price tag didn't match the table fare.  Value was marginal.  Service was very good  and we all enjoyed our time together.  The food was just not as special as one might expect  considering the price & location.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Had lunch at Olives today and it was FANTASTIC. The food was amazing and the service was even better! For dessert  I had this ORGASMIC chocolate peanut butter molten lava cake with this delicious creamy white stuff. I could not stop putting it into my mouth over and over again. I even asked the waiter if he would eat it off my body. He said  ""No  thanks."" But whatever  I tipped him well because he kept my thirst quenched with prompt water refills. Two very enthusiastic thumbs up  will return to convince waiter about dessert proposal. By the way  ask to sit with Eric. He was sexy AF."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Consistently excellent. Been here a few times in the past couple of years and it hasn't disappointed. Beautiful terrace view complements the high end preparations of food. The dishes are approachable yet sophisticated. I enjoyed the tuna carpaccio and beef tenderloin. My wife thought the seafood pasta was better than the one at Lago. The people sitting next to us had the Cuban sandwich and couldn't stop raving about it. Not to shabby if you ask me.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I brought my wife and kid here for Mother's Day. I've been to Olives two or three other times and either I'm getting more difficult to please or their food is going downhill because we left a little disappointed. There are still some good items on the menu like the butternut tortelli. Fresh pasta is always amazing and top it off with a wonderfully rich sauce and you'll swear off those crappy Italian chain restaurants for good. Don't forget that you can order half portions of their pastas if you'd like to sample several dishes.  The disappointment started with the beef carpaccio. The serving size is so ridiculously large that it looks unappetizing. There's a huge softball-sized mound under the center of the beef full of greens. The dish is also drowning in sauces that dominate in flavor and all of that wonderful beef flavor is lost. There's just too much going on. The dish is large enough for 4-6 people.  The next disappointment was the ribeye special. The overcooked and bland steak had all the appeal of a choice cut  $2.99 special from your local grocer. They really should have been ashamed of serving that dish. It was one of the worst steaks I've had in a long time.  On a positive note  the view from the patio is gorgeous! If you can get a seat out there you'll be treated to the Bellagio fountains and one of the better views in the city. It can get really hot out there so go early when dining for lunch or late when dining for dinner. The atmosphere  service  and pasta saved this lunch from being a awful but I'm not sure if I'd bother coming back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Unlike the review from the 22nd we were treated exceptionally. We are a younger couple without the glitz and glam but we were treated like royalty. Perhaps the difference was the server. In our case we had Paul and he was absolutely awesome.     Before going on with the review let me back up a bit. We were looking for a place to eat that night and were walking through the Bellagio when my wife said  ""That Olives restaurant has a balcony but it is first-come  first-serve so we probably could not get out there."". Me being the kind of guy who would rather ask and get told ""no"" than not ask at all went up to the hostess and asked about any openings on the balcony. To my amazement I was told there would be a table for two in 45 minutes if I cared to wait. With the night being beautiful and a chance to sit outside and eat we readily agreed to wait. Approximately 30 minutes later we were led out to the balcony and seated. The balcony is small  I'd venture to guess there was enough space for about 30 people. I do not know for sure but I believe the tables directly next to the edge overlooking the Bellagio Fountain were reserved for Black Card (mlife) holders which we were not. We were seated at the back of the balcony but we could still see the fountains and had a beautiful view of the strip. (We also just happened to be seated at 7pm when the fountains played every 15 minutes so we saw the whole line up of songs during our dinner...I highly recommend this timing).   Like I said in the beginning  Paul was our server and he was wonderful. He treated us like we were special though we were not in suits  not bedazzled in jewelry  and certainly no high-roller status. We were dressed nicely though a few on the balcony were dressed very poorly even for a casual dining restaurant. We were served with smiles and warmth as was everyone else out there including the poorly dressed group though by a different server.  Paul even took our picture for us with our camera during what he called ""Picture time"". He had an excellent sense of humor that matched ours which seems hard to do these days. He made our night.   The customer service  view  and fountains were amazing but the food...boy was that some of the best food we have eaten in a while. The drinks were made perfectly  the complimentary bread basket paired with the Olive Tapenade was one of a kind. Delicious! The flat bread...well it did not last long. For entrees my wife ordered the chicken and I ordered Salmon. My meal was perfect  my wife's chicken was overdone but still tasty. We could have probably requested a new one but it was not inedible and it was still very delicious so we did not. We were too full for dessert though what I saw others eating looked amazing.   Overall  an excellent experience and I would go back if I was back in Vegas. I also highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a delicious meal. If you are willing to wait for the balcony I would do it and try to time it for the more frequent fountain shows. Well worth it!   Try to get Paul as he was amazing  though the rest seemed equally as awesome."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great  upscale dining experience!  We stumbled across this restaurant while walking through the Bellagio  and since my friend has an olive obsession  we went in solely because the name of the restaurant was Olives. We started off with the best beef carpaccio in the world. The portion was HUGE--definitely more than enough for 3 people to share. We were also given a variety of breads that came with olives and 2 tapenades. Yum  yum  yum.  The server was friendly  efficient  and offered a lot of suggestions. I ended up getting the scallop dish  while my friend ordered their bass. Simple and full of very well-developed  amazing flavors. Neither dish disappointed. We opted for liquid dessert. Drinking their key lime pie martini while watching the bellagio fountains in action put a great finishing touch on our delightful meal!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,To be fair  the food was pretty decent. But it took far too long to eat a simple lunch here. We sat at 12:30  when we were hungry and got our food at 1:40 by which time I had already passed the point of being hungry. It was odd as several tables around us who were seated after us were able to get their food - and some were even able to finish their entire meals - before we so much as glimpsed ours. Lunch without drinks set us back $100  and while I don't mind paying a lot for a good experience  this was not worth the Benjamin we dropped. I would take your business elsewhere if I were you  like we plan to do going forward.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I did not enjoy my $20 burger and  $19 for a beer is insane.  Service was bad.  Nothing nice about the venue.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was a very nice place  great setting overlooking the fountains  and the service was amazing  everything was hot and prompt and correctly prepared.  But I felt rushed as if there was a need to turn tables.  Which they were.  Its not a take your time dining experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the most disappointing meal during our visit in Vegas last week.  We visited the place and it was packed. So  we made reservation for three days later. This place is way overated !!!  There was nothing worth mentioning.  We cordered mushroom pappardelle and sea bass. Nothing stood out other than the price. For the price  location  and hype  I expected something more.   The cocktails were okay. I ordered three pears and the sling. #15 per drink. Not much alcohol in them. more like fruit juice.   The service was friendly thought. The waitress was very pleasant. But toward the end of the meal  you can sense they want you out because people are waiting outside..  overated ! hype!  Didn't live up to my expectation for a Bellagio Vegas experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a wonderful place to enjoy a delicious family dinner.  We reserved the Chefs Table and had a private area (not easy in Vegas) for our family of 10.   The view of the fountain was an extra plus.   Everyone loved their food and the wine was also excellent.   The wait staff couldn't have been more gracious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went here for lunch  it was pretty awesome. We had the fig pizza  the tuna carpaccio  the butternut squash ravioli  and truffle fries. The food was super flavorful and the wait staff was very easy going  cool  and attentive. We sat on the patio and had a good time even though it was a bit windy. This is definitely one of the best spots on the strip for lunch.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had reservations and when we were seated it was adjacent to the bar in the pathway of all the people going to the outdoor patio seating.  smack in the middle of the bar area.  I felt like I was sitting in the middle of a thoroughfare.  Not a very relaxing atmosphere.  Our server was good as well as the rest of the staff.  I ordered the charred octopus and squid which was like eating rubber bands...the octopus was the small tiny whole octopus in a chick pea sauce.  Not edible  very rubbery and certainly they were not charred.  My entree was the salmon and that was very good.  Not sure if I would return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We have been to Olives many times as we frequent Vegas 2-4 times a year. Olives is ALWAYS on our list. First off  you can not beat the view of the fountains it is unbelievable. The food is always excellent. We've had almost everything on the menu at this point. We have never been disappointed. After being there so many times we have come to know the staff. Nicole  Ernie  Raul  Paul  and Elaine are a few of my favorites but everyone is so nice and accommodating at Olives.  The drinks are amazing the bartenders are so talented. The butternut squash ravioli is one of my favorites. The ricotta ravioli is my husbands favorite. The last time we had the spinach  chicken  and artichoke flatbread for the first time and LOVED IT! The creme Brule is a MUST!!!!! The staff  the food  the drinks  the view will amaze time and time again. We will return in July and of course Olives is on our list!! Great for lunch or dinner!!! They also accept open table which is very convenient. Try it  you can't go wrong!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,They continue to have poor to mediocre food. I've never had a memorable meal here. Nice view of fountains fr patio. That's about it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This place is always so packed! We made reservations for 11 of us at 7pm last night but got there around 5:30 to try and get patio seating to watch the fountain show but no luck. I guess you have to stop in 2 1/2 hours prior to get on the patio wait list. Even without that  we were still seated later than our reservation (which was not their fault since they can't control how quickly customers vacate after dinner).   The cocktail menus and desserts were displayed on iPads. Instead of getting several cocktails  my husband and I just decided to go with a bottle of wine. The 2012 Cabernet Sauvignon from Pasa Robles fit well with the beef tenderloin that I ordered. My friend ordered the Tiffany Cocktail which was sweet  light  and refreshing and of course  target as a ""girly"" drink!  The beef tenderloin was ordered medium rare but on the ""rarer"" side. There was a demi glaze that was slightly sweet but not overpowering. The beef was cooked perfectly and it was a perfect meat selection that had pure taste but not entirely unique like some other places where I've had steak in Vegas. It was served with lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus which made a good traditional combo. The tiny bits of lobster in the mashed potatoes was a nice touch.  Service was great  as it should be for a restaurant like this. Our waiter handled our group of 11 seamlessly and even split our checks at the end which was hard because our group was being silly and the environment was very loud."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When my good friend suggested lunch here when we were both working Saturdays  I jumped at the chance.  Olives had a summer tasting menu which ended on July 30th and we just made the cut.  Before I even tell you how great the food was  what a freaking value!! For $30  you got a 3 course lunch.  First Course: choice of grilled vegetable gazpacho or Eggplant tart  Second Course: Choice of rock cod po' boy prime sirloin or herb roasted chicken with fettucine pasta  Third Course: Carrot Cake!  My friend had the soup and chicken.  She was kind enough to give me a bite and the chicken was awesome and I don't even really like fettucine.  I had the eggplant tart  which I shared and we both agreed that it was awesome.  The eggplant was breaded and fried and had the consistency of chicken tenders on a flatbread pizza.  Served with arugula.  Yeah  it sounds weird  but it was really really good.  My entree was the sirloin and I loved every bite.  Another bonus  this place has a great view and a lovely patio.  We thought about sitting outside but sweating my balls off makes it a little hard to enjoy lunch  so we passed.  Would definitely like to come here when the weather cools.  Plus  unlike some of the places in the Bellagio  this place regularly switches up its menu.  The carrot cake was good  standard carrot cake  but by this point  I was a stuffed sausage and could not do damage to the cake.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I came here for my birthday last year 8/25/2013  again it was a very boring restaurant boring customer service I did however tell the server to surprise me between the unique ravioli dish on the menu or the Seabass and she brought of the Seabass and I was very satisfied that was so stuffy in there that I thought like I was sitting on the gentleman next to me slap I wouldn't go back and less maybe I made reservations in advance for the patio at night to watch the fountain shoot off and be super close just for the photo up and maybe give the food another try!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Al Fresco dining. Steak  pasta  seafood. The Strip  Paris and the spectacular Fountains to keep you entertained during your meal. Loved it.  If you want to splurge or treat yourself to some fine dining at the heart of Vegas. Try Olives and take some selfies.  To dine right next to the Bellagio Fountains will be one of the highlights of your Vegas experience.  Just beautiful.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The atmosphere is beautiful and the food is so good. All the different breads in the bread bowl were amazing and their green olive spread went really well with the breads. I got the ricotta ravioli which was amazing- the raviolis were so fresh and the Italian sausage mixed in was really flavorful. The only only thing was the wine was eh. But that doesn't even matter because of how satisfying the food was.  My man def got it right by picking this place for our last dinner in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had a group of 11 of us for dinner for a bachelor party. They seated us at the chef's table that was indoors but had a view of the fountains which was awesome. The food was also fantastic. I don't like olives but I had to try the tapenade that came with the bread to start. It was pretty good. I figured if the restaurant is called olives then you have to try it.  We had the fig & prosciuotto flat bread to start and it was amazing. As my main course I had the beef tenderloin with asparagus tempura and potato puree. It was very good. I would say the food was not quite as good as Gordon Ramsey's Steak restaurant but the experience was just as good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,great view of the bellagio fountains on the patio but the food was mediocre. ordered a couple of the daily specials and they were just ok.  the bread and olives they give u before are delicious tho.  wait staff was friendly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice settings and view.  I was there for the 20 year anniversary special lunch menu.  $25 for 3 items.   Ordered the Tai-styled oyster tomatoe soup - way too salty.  If not it would have been good.  But only 1 oyster! Then the squash pasta - very tasty.  House made pasta  done very well.  But too oily and a bit salty.  I wonder why they keep putting so much salt on it if the flavors are supposed to be good. Lastly the desert - chocholate and icecream.  OK.  Want to rate 4 stars if not for the SALT!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of our top spots whenever we're in Vegas  even when we're not staying at the Bellagio.  On our last visit  we started with the escargot and I swear we were served a small army of those little suckers  all yummy in their baths of garlic and butter with goat cheese crostinis.  I nearly passed out.   We've enjoyed their pastas  especially the lobster carbonara  the seabass is always fantastic  and any time we've had a steak with any preparation  it's been sublime.    It's always crowded   folks.  Even with a reservation  you might have to wait.  So belly up to the bar.  The guys there are very un-Vegas-like and actually friendly and there's a nice wine list.    Yes  you could sit outside by the fountains  and that IS nice  but sometimes you just want to get all cozy in a lovely dark restaurant with your partner and stuff your face with some snails and wash it down with a big fat cab.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Been here at least a handful of times over the years when the wallet gets a little fat and starts burning a hole in my pocket. Not cheap  we drop at least $150+ for two (appetizer  entree  desert and drinks)  but its oh so worth it....everytime. The decor is fanstastic and interesting to look around at  although we are so over the waterfountain thing.   Anyway  this is the one and only reason that we attempt to go near the cheezy played out strip these days. I'm dreaming about the souffle now  mmm. The chefs there are truly artist and masters of their craft  thank you for your fine work! It's always nice to taste what millionaires and billionaires eat like everyday.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The food was quite good  though the breaded monkfish was a bit disappointing. Make sure you sit in such a way that you're not looking at the ""window."" Who wants to feel like they're eating in a mall?"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had made a reservation for 9:15 here because we wanted a seat outside with a view of the fountain show....... It decided to rain  so they closed the outside :( anyways they accommodated us to a table closest to the glass wall so that we can see the show :)   The drink menu was on an iPad which I thought was pretty cool! I was recommended to have the 'Slingback' martini.... I loved it! As soon as a finished my first  I ordered another one. We ordered the squid and octopus and the chicken and sausage flatbread. Both things were okay  my friend said that the squid and octopus should've came with bread or something for dipping since it looked more like a soup than anything else. Overall  the atmosphere was really nice and the view was beautiful.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was absolutely fantastic! Best restaurant on the strip. We came here for dinner and lunch the next day. Sat out on the patio for a wonderful view of the Bellagio fountain show!  The bread basket and olive tapenade were a great start to a delicious evening.  I highly recommend the butternut squash tortelli...Definitely a must!  And the creme brulee.  The creme brulee. OMG. Hands down the BEST I've ever had. The cookie butter on the bottom was to die for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Oh for this great find! Walking through the Bellagio  Todd English's Olives was practically screaming at me to dine in-- beautiful ambiance  perfect decor  and most importantly the beautiful water fountain show for your enjoyment every 15 minutes or so (maybe it was this frequent for NYE). It was an absolute perfect way to enjoy your meal in vegas. The bread and olive tapenade were AHMAZING! I had the mushroom flatbread with its truffle oil was delicious!   The main entrees seem a bit overpriced but the flat breads were reasonable. Service was mediocre but everything else made up for it.   Where else can you dine in front of the bellagio fountains?!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had one of the best dinners here. Everything was great. I asked the hostess if we could eat outside and we were given an amazing table right on the water. It was so fun to eat such great food while enjoying the water show every 15 minutes.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The drinks and service is really good. Get the window or outside seat for good view. I ordered ravioli but it did not taste like a delicacy it tasted like frozen ravioli.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The boyfriend and I decided to stop by somewhere to eat before shopping our hearts out. He had eaten here before and I hadn't. Even though he raved about the food  I was still a little wary because I felt as if I didn't have time to scope out the Yelp page. Especially because I'm usually the one that chooses where to eat after carefully reading all of the quick tips and Yelp reviews for a restaurant.   After we were seated we looked through the drink menu they provided on the iPad. I tried the Fountain Mist which had a little watermelon in it and my boyfriend had the one with cucumber and a sugar cayenne pepper rim. I completely forgot the name but it was so refreshing and the pepper gave it that extra zing!  We ordered two appetizers and one entree. At first we were unsure about whether that would be enough food and our waiter Dennis was so accommodating. He told us to see how we full we felt after the appetizers and we could always add another entree. Now onto the food...  Bread basket  A great selection of bread served with olive tapenades. I couldn't stop eating it!  Appetizers Grilled squid and octopus - Amazing! The squid and octopus is grilled first then sauteed in this delicious tomato and garlic sauce with chickpeas.  Beef carpaccio- I have eaten this at every restaurant I go to that serves it and not only is the portion huge but it's definitely #1 on my list. The Parmesan  onions  polenta  scallion cream  garlic aioli  just works so well together (I'm drooling while writing this review).  Entree Scallops and prosciutto -3 scallops on a delicious truffle parm risotto. My first bite was delish but when I took my second bite I made sure I got some of the CRISPY prosciutto and just fell in love!  I definitely want to come back to try other dishes on the menu and see what their dinner menu has to offer. The wait staff was extremely attentive  funny  and just so personable. We left with huge smiles on our faces and full bellies... Couldn't really ask for more.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to Olives on our last night in Vegas.  We were lucky enough to get a table outside without a reservation.  It seemed to be first come  first served  and we were there at about 20 mins before the restaurant opened  second in line.  Wooo perfect timing!  The view was amazing.  Although  be warned that if the winds are high  then you might get a bit of spray from the fountains.  The food was the best I've ever had in Vegas  and I've done my fair share of eating there!   They bring out an assortment of breads and spreads  and olives.  Super tasty.  We got an appetizer  the special that night was a heirloom tomato salad.  It was huge  definitely enough to share for 2 people.    I had the salmon for dinner  and wow.  It was cooked perfectly!  Definitely want to make another stop back through here when we go back to Vegas next.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My sisters  mom and I dined here on a very busy Friday Night. Although I did not make a reservation it only took us approximately 6 minutes to be escorted to our table inside. However  we still had an amazing view of the fountains. Not too shabby. The atmosphere was very sophisticated and chic. Which is another reason we chose to eat at this place. Our waiter was pleasant but made no recommendations or researched to see if this was our first time dining at the restaurant. Drink orders were taken promptly and the delicious bread sample with the olive tapenade was divine!!  I ordered the butternut squash tortellini which was very light  creamy and had a slight sweetness to it which I enjoyed. The herbal sauce paired really well. My mom ordered the salmon which was MEH! It was seasoned with salt and pepper  NOTHING savory about it at all. One of my sisters order a dish that had to be taken back because the description did not indicate that it was SPICY! (We almost had a reenactment of the scene with Pierce Brosnan in Mrs. Doubtfire). The manager was gracious enough to have that dish remade without the spiciness and did so within a expedited amount of time. However  it would've been really awesome if he could've comped the meal or offered a complimentary dessert. But nah  its Vegas so it's all about the MONEY. Go figure. Anywho my other sister order the lobster fettuccine which was VERY VERY bland & also a  very SMALL portion for the price. I must say flavor wise i expected to experience the richness of flavors that is associated with Mediterranean cuisines and the only thing that truly came close to embodying that area of the world was the olive tapenade. I was really hoping for the best of the best considering the restaurant's real estate location  the price and overall atmosphere. Unfortunately  i left unimpressed and disappointed in the menu. C'mon Olives you had me at hello...but it wasn't enough to keep me coming back for more. Sigh.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went to lunch at one of my favorite Olives....Staff was professional as well as extremely friendly.....This is clearly my mistake for not calling them out on this....Lunch was good HOWEVER we ordered dessert and asked for a little Ice cream with it....Got the Cobbler and a 2inch small bowl of vanilla ice cream came to $20....Big lesson ALWAYS ASK HOW MUCH.   Then someone else ordered 2 scoops of ice cream $12.50  really did not get this AT ALL.  It remains one of my favorites but I need to speak up and ASK about COST.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A beautiful & fancy place for a nice dinner out in Las Vegas. I went with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday and we were lucky enough to get a table out on the patio. Getting to sit out there with the fountain show was lovely! It very much was a classy Vegas experience. The menu has a lot of good choices  including things for vegetarians.   I had the mushroom papardelle  which was quite delicious but a little too rich if you want to go out after dinner. The mushrooms were wonderful  the pasta noodles were so good  and the peas & pea shoots helped take some of the edge off the creaminess. The menu mentioned truffle essence but I didn't catch any of that. At $34 a plate  it's definitely a lot  but it was a very large portion and had I been going back to my room there would have been enough to put in a take away box for later. My husband had the ricotta & sausage ravioli  and devoured it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We just had a amazing dinner at Olives. The food was great and the service was incredible!!! Paul Anthony made our evening. I have eaten at a lot of different restaurant both in the US and internationally and he was probably the best waiter I had.  He volunteer to take our picture in front of the water. It was so personable and very service-oriented. He went above and beyond to make our experience at Olives very special . I was smiling the whole meal and really enjoyed the night. Thank you Paul A for giving us such a wonderful experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Not the most amazing experience I've had in Las Vegas  but we went for lunch and only ordered the flatbreads. However  my friend ordered the scallops and said they were perfectly cooked  so this review is mainly about the service. The waitress tended to be unattentive
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Pros: very lovely atmosphere  especially on the balcony; delicious food that was all cooked to perfection; my water and wine glass was never even close to empty (even on a Friday night!)  Cons: shockingly unfriendly staff  Even though there was only one major con  I still only rate this restaurant a 3-star  because of the service. I went there for my 21st birthday with my boyfriend and was loving the atmosphere and the food  but extremely disappointed at the staff  especially for paying so much money! Our waiter did not check our ID's when we ordered wine  and as I said it was only my 21st birthday and I look like I am 16 years old. There was hardly a smile from both the staff who seated us and our server. The only friendly staff members were the buss boys! I tried to chalk it up to being a Friday night  but out server's behavior over the dessert menu was appalling. My boyfriend wanted to order me some dessert to celebrate my birthday  but I was insisting I was too full for it (especially for another $20 on a slice of cake). My boyfriend still tried to let my server know that it was a special occasion for us and our server responded with ""We would have been able to do something  but you declined to order dessert"" loud enough for me to hear. Upon seeing the disgusted look on my face the server said ""Let me see what I can do"". He then brought out a plate with three of the smallest cream puffs I have ever seen and a candle and just set it on the table with the check and walked away. Let me begin by saying that I was fine with not having any dessert or candles  and my boyfriend was only trying to make me feel special  but what the server said and how he acted was service that I have NEVER received anywhere  let alone somewhere where dinner for two cost us over $150. I have eaten on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris for the view of the Belagio water show several times before  and unfortunately that is where I will be returning to.   Disappointed."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I was a lucky gal this year for my birthday. My boyfriend wanted to treat me to a romantic birthday dinner at any restaurant I wished to try  so without any hesitation  I chose Olives! Their reviews looked immaculate  the view looked amazing  and the food...just look at the food! It was an absolute must for me.  View 4/5 - the outdoor patio balcony has the ultimate seats  so make sure to try your luck and get their early (before 5pm). It's first come first served on the patio  regardless of reservations. If you come a minute late  you might get stuck with the back seats on the patio  which are not as amazing as the seats right at the edge of the balcony - the view at the edge is unobstructed from those large umbrellas and super up close and personal with the Bellagio fountains.   Service 4/5 - When we walked up to the host stand  the woman was busy talking to another employee  maybe a manger? But they didn't acknowledge us at all to let us know that they will be a moment. A couple minutes later  when they were done talking  she asked us if we had reservations - I said yes  and gave her my name. I thought that our first impression of their staff and that whole ordeal was disorganized and amateur.   After we were seated  the service that we received from our waitress Michelle M. was pleasant and gracious. It appeared that she had read our reservation notes  because she even wished me a happy birthday  which was a sweet gesture. Our water was refilled immediately and frequently with the blink of an eye  our bread basket was refilled right when we requested it and also our tapenade and olives were replaced with a fresh batch alongside it. They even doggy bagged the rest of our delicious uneaten bread from our basket and provided us with a new set of the amazing tapenade  to take home.  At the very end of our meal  our waitress Michelle surprised me with a complimentary plate of 3 cream puffs filled with mousse. The plate was drizzled with chocolate  some berries  with a message in chocolate that said ""happy birthday"" and also 1 lit candle. It was a  lovely gesture and we appreciated it so much!   Ambiance 5/5 - I am in love with the intimate lighting and decor inside of the restaurant. The environment was dimly lit  mysterious  stylish and sexy. Definitely special occasion it up at this place!   Food 5/5 - There was extreme precision and care in the execution and plating of our dishes. The presentation was absolutely gorgeous and vibrant! Both of our dishes were prepared expertly  seasoned to perfection  and incorporated top notch flavor.   1. Complimentary bread basket with black olive tapenade  green olive tapenade  and a variety of olives were all incredible. Each and every kind of bread was perfect alone  or with the tapenade. I favored the bread that had some pops of sweetness to it and the Parmesan crisp.   2. Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle with king trumpet  shiitake  oyster & crimini mushrooms  english peas  piquillo peppers  parmesan cream  truffle essence  and lemony pea shoots - $34 - The presentation was exquisite. Was it delicious? Absolutely! The dish was flawless. It was luscious and creamy  the pappardelle was cooked al dente  had a hearty abundance of mushrooms  had an overall great mushroom flavor.   3. Atlantic Salmon cooked medium well  with creamy beet risotto  sauteed vegetables  curry beurre blanc  roasted fennel & arugula - $36 - This dish was stunning to look at and they did not disappoint in execution. The salmon was cooked perfectly  moist  buttery  and expertly seasoned. The risotto  was slightly sweet  very rich  and paired perfectly with the salmon. The vegetables were all beautiful  cooked with care and added an amazing texture to the dish. I was a fan of this dish!   Value 4/5 - Honestly  you have to remind yourself that you are paying high strip prices and for also being inside of the Bellagio (with a view like that) you'll be paying top dollar for ambiance. Total was $80.53 for 2 dinner entrees and 1 ($4.50) coke  including tax. The portions were great and they were very generous with the bread refills and the tapenade. Yet  was the mushroom pappardelle worth $34? I don't think so. Maybe if they knocked it a few down to $25...$28 even  then it would be right on the money. There wasn't any protein besides the mushrooms to make that dish that pricey. But we still enjoyed every last bit of it."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you're ever in the mood for a nice cocktail or a sophisticated lunch or dinner  stop by the Bellagio and reserve a table at Olives.  Todd English's restaurant is modern with a hint of classical decorative details  and boasts a brief  elegant and comforting menu.  With the Bellagio fountains right outside and an outdoor patio seating area (which is fully booked all day so make reservations in advance for lunch or dinner) for the best view of the fountain show  it's a quaint place to stop by and have some great food.  To celebrate my husband's new job  we ate dinner here and I had to make reservations two days ahead because they are always fully booked if you try for same-day.  We were seated indoors with a nice view of the fountain area  and we were immediately greeted by our server for the evening.  Our napkins were placed on our laps for us  and an option of bottled or regular water was brought to the table (I went bottled).  The server explained the specials for the evening and within ten minutes were ordered food.  The timing is excellent at Olives.  Not only do they have a great bread basket to munch on that comes with a terrific  salty olive tapenade  but the appetizers took no more than 8 minutes from order to table.  I was happy with the lack of wait time for the start of our meal.  We ordered  with the server's suggestion  the portobello flatbread and crab fritters.  The flatbread was outstanding  with the truffle oil enhancing the lovely portobello slices on top of the crispy flatbread.  To even out the texture there were caramelized red onions on top  which cut the masculine mushroom flavor down to perfection.  If I had known that the portions were so big I would order the flatbread as a meal in itself.  As for the lump crab fritters  they were light and creamy inside with a lovely kick of sriracha aioli on top  and a bed of herb sauce to scoop up with the fresh arugula sprinkled atop.  Between the two appetizers I was happy with the flatbread  but crab lovers may devour the fritters here.  After our table was cleared and cleaned up (down to the crumbs  mind you)  another 7 minutes passed and our entrees were in front of us.  My filet oscar was beautifully presented and turned out to be quite a large portion.  They split the filet in half  but the filet must be very thick because it honestly looked like two healthy portions of meat on my plate.  The char marks were on the edges  which I love  and the meat was topped with beautiful lump crabmeat and sat on a bed of Japanese asparagus and whipped potatoes.  They drizzled a caramelized onion and wine reduction sauce on top that gave the entire dish that umami flavor.  The asparagus were perfectly blanched and the whipped potatoes were a cloud of heaven on a plate.  As for the filet  it was perfectly cooked and seasoned  not overdone with any extra herbs or spices.  It was simply seasoned and well grilled.  I loved every bite.  My husband's chilean sea bass  on the other hand  was fabulous.  I wanted to eat his plate more than I did my filet at one point!  It was light  creamy  buttery  and had that pan sear on top that just blew my mind.  The shaved fennel with arugula sitting on top of the fish was good when taken as one bite with the protein.  Overall  it was a success!  To complete my review we had to order dessert  so we waited the 10 minutes it took for them to whip up the Madagascar vanilla souffle  cooked to order.  They said it would take 15 minutes  but it arrived within 10.  I took a picture of it (which is here) and when they brought it out it had that beautiful golden top like meringue has when coming out of the oven.  The server took a small scoop of vanilla bean ice cream  gently placed it into the souffle   then topped the hole he made with an entire carafe of  anglaise.  The dessert was heaven.  It was airy and the vanilla used was so beautiful that I closed my eyes with the first bite.  I love souffles  and in all honesty this one is now one of my favorites in Vegas.  Creamy  airy  and with just the right sweetness  it was the perfect end to the experience.  Overall  great food  excellent service and a wonderful change from any other restaurant on the strip.  With a wonderful menu and excellent flavors and textures in every dish  I truly enjoyed the entire experience.  If you want something different  something other than French or italian fare  try Olives.  It's worth the reservation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love this place. The food is excellent top to bottom and the staff is extraordinarily attentive. My wife can't eat dairy and all three times we've been there  they have adjusted dishes to meet her needs and all were delicious.   The squid and octopus appetizer is one of my favorites and the tuna tartare is outstanding as well. This trip my wife had the beef tenderloin  which was like butter  and the olive oil mashed potatoes  which were really great. I had the sea bass with sausage and bean cassoulet  watercress  and garlicky broccolini  all in an orange juice and balsamic vinegar sauce that was just perfect.   The menu is not cheap but this place is totally worth it  right down to the delicious olive tapanades that come with the bread. If you're looking for a great dinner in Vegas  this should be on the list.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a great time their for my 7 year anniversary. We had a late dinner  and were seated upon arrival. I requested the patio  but it was full. No problem because they seated me by the window  so I enjoyed the fountain while staying out of the wind.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was okay nothing spectacular.  The Beef Carpachi was very good.   We ordered mussels as a appetizer and there were only 5 mussels that were just average in size and one of them did not have a mussel.  That was very disappointing!!!  Also the service was extremely slow and after we ordered appetizer we asked for our check.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"When you're dining at this restaurant  it is very  very easy to overeat so I am very glad that I had my husband with me who reminded me that I'm ordering too much food!  He is my so-called ""food conscience/police"".   I ordered the Grilled Octopus  Flat Bread and Mahi-Mahi.  My husband ordered the martini and lobster carbonara.  The flat bread came first and it was delicious.  Never had anything like that before.  Then came the Grilled Octopus.  Only then did I realize that I was already full and probably won't be able to finish my Mahi Mahi so we called our waiter and asked if he can still cancel it.  He was very accommodating.  He said no problem so that's one point for him!  The Grilled Octopus is my absolute favorite.  It's very lime-y and very tender unlike most of the ones that I tried which are kindda rubbery.  It was excellent!  My husband liked the flat bread the most.  We decided we'd share the Lobster Carbonara.  The serving is huge and they split the lobster into 2 so it was easy for us to really share it.  They also brought extra plates in.  Despite the fact that it was very delicious and we really enjoyed it  we still weren't able to finish it.  As a matter of fact  the next time I come back  I'd probably just have the flat bread and grilled octopus.  The Lobster Carbonara was very good too but it was expensive - $41!    I would have given the place 5 stars except that the dessert was awful.  We ordered the mango brulee and it tasted old. It tasted like it has been sitting out there for a while.  We did not even finish it.  I should have followed my instinct and skipped dessert but then we were celebrating my husband's birthday.  What is a birthday without dessert  right?  Anyway  skip the dessert  eat more of the flat bread and order some cocktails.  That should do it!  And by the way  the view of the Bellagio fountain from the restaurant is just incredible.  It is actually better than the view from the strip.  So request a table by the window if it's cold and by the patio if it's warm."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'm sure after a 1000 reviews everything has been covered. But I'd just like to say the service was beyond accommodating  the ambiance/view was classy/beautiful and the food was delicious (they have the greatest beef carpaccio I've ever had)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,These guys didn't honor my reservation for sitting on the balcony. I had a reservation for 7.15 and they said the best they can do is 8.45. They offered to seat us neat window as consolation but even that was badly placed. The window was blocked by huge cashier machine of some sorts. Spoiled all my plans. The only reason I'm not giving it one star of because the waiter was considerate enough to make us something off the menu since there's zero items without eggs. Not even pasta.  Very bad place for vegetarians. Disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"One of my favorite Las Vegas restaurants. Both times I've been to Olives  we've made sure we had patio seating for an INCREDIBLE view of the Bellagio fountains throughout dinner (also  those of you who smoke can do so!). The food has also never disappointed. In fact I had much better food here than I did at Postrio or Aureole.   Both times  I informed them that my dinner was planned right before Cirque du Soleil ""O "" and both times they provided excellent service while being very quick and even more attentive to the time than we were!  ______________________________________  My first visit to Olives was in February 2009. It was an incredible meal  one that left us craving for more and allowed us to end our week of indulgence (2 B'ways  3 Cirques  1 Le Reve  & many good meals) on a good note. We had:  * JUMBO SEA SCALLOPS - sweet corn risotto  fall heirloom tomato salad  arugula  warm bacon bread crumbs      - [5/5 - The flavors  textures  and smells were perfect.. Those scallops virtually melted in your mouth. Still the ultimate best scallops I've ever tasted.] * PAN SEARED MAHI MAHI - honey white polenta  baby carrots  butter braised giant prawns  spice market sauce      - [5/5 - It's been a while  but I recall it being very soft  well-seasoned  and yummafying.]    ______________________________________  My second visit to Olives was in January 2010. We had:  * VEAL AGNOLOTTI AL PLIN - slow braised osso buco  fontina cheese agnolotti  truffle butter      - [5/5 - Wow. I will tell you this - my friend was very  very  very jealous.] * RICOTTA RAVIOLI - roasted tomato basil sauce  sweet italian sausage  garlic bread crumbs      - [4/5 - Delicious  but not really very special.]"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"it is very romantic to be seated on the heated patio in front of the Bellagio fountains...  the delicious food  the beautifully choreographed fountains  the wonderful music compose together a titillating stimulation of all senses...  makes u fall in love...  i have a sweet tooth and my favorites are all a bit sweet: * Sweet Potato Apple Soup - i didn't had any  but it must be really good since my friend chowed it all up and did not mention how tasty it was until it was all gone * Carpaccio - the presentation does not look good  but the more i eat  the tastier it gets and i could not get enough of it * Souffle - it tastes as good as any good souffle.  u probably want your own if u love dessert because it is like eating air * Double Cut Pork Chop - impressive presentation & ginormous portions compared to other dishes.  moist  a bit fatty and charred with a slightly sweet sauce that is somewhat like the chinese ""char siu"" sauce  we got there 5:30pm on a Monday and there were a few tables available for parties of 2-4.  a few tables opened up around 6pm.  when in doubt regarding what to order  ask the waiter/waitress.  our waitress said that they made her taste all the dishes and her recommendations were spot on!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,my second time here and this time it was not up to par for lunch i had a chicken club sandwich and the chicken was very dry and uneatable  the flat bread was good and simply plain and not spectacular this place is a hit or miss if you sit outside the view is great
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a great meal at Olives!!  Portabello mushroom flatbread was outta this world in my opinion.  Great view of Lake Bellagio.  Unlike alot of people  I found sitting inside the restaurant better than being outside.  Outside seemed too loud with the music from the fountain shows.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First things first  do not eat a buffet for lunch hoping to still be hungry for Olives by 6PM! Major fail...  Since we were still relatively full from lunch  we opted to wait an additional 45mins to be seated by the window where we could enjoy the Bellagio Fountain Water show.   We were promptly seated at 6:45PM. Three different servers asked us if they could get us something to drink. It was a bit confusing because we didn't know who was our actual server for the night  but felt nice to be acknowledged.  My fiance and I ordered a glass of wine each and then went for the Hudson Valley foie gras appetizer and Boston Bibb salad. Both were delicious. The foie gras melted in my mouth and I wished we had a larger piece of it. The salad had a nice mix of greens and the dressing was very tasty.  Since we are fatties  we continued on to order our entrees. We decided to share the fig and prosciutto flatbread and sea scallops.  The prosciutto was so thin and decadent and paired wonderfully with the fig. The scallops were sweet and juicy. The truffle mashed potato was delicious. Every bite I could taste the truffle oil coming through and it brought out the sweetness of the scallops even more. My fiance thought the truffle oil was too overpowering and the mashed potato not lumpy enough  but I thought it was still phenomenal.  We'll definitely come back to try the beef carpaccio and other dishes we were too full to try this time around.  We ended the night with a perfect berry creme brulee. The berries were fresh and gave the perfect tartness to the creamy and sweet creme brulee. There were also bacon and pepper cookies on top that actually worked really well with the dessert.  Of course nothing could beat watching the water show while enjoying such a great meal! It was defiinitely worth the wait.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Honestly it disappoints me to have to write yet another blah review for a restaurant in Bellagio....We already had a horrible meal at the buffet but because Jasmine was so amazing I figured the other private restaurants would be better as well..... So  first  we ordered. Me: The flatbread with mushrooms and truffle oil  crab stuffed shrimp and green beans with mashed potatoes. My husband: hamburger medium rare. Caesar salad. His Caesar was excellent. They never brought me the felt bread and admitted to forgetting the order.... so we just ordered onion rings with the shrimp. His burger came WELL DONE.... and wasn't that great. My shrimp was overcooked and frankly tasteless. I am from Boston so I know fresh seafood. The onion rings were VERY greasy. The green beans were excellent ( actually haricot vertes) and the mashed potatoes tasteless. The manager actually came over and asked how the food was. I said "" Do you REALLY want to know?"" She said  ""Yes  absolutely"" We told her all the complaints and she was SO incredibly nice. She brought me the flat bread but by the time it came my appetite was already ruined. It didn't have a very truffle oil taste to it either. The replaced onion rings were much better. It turns out the shrimp were not fresh but previously frozen as I suspected....I wish I could separate the food from the waitstaff as they were incredibly gracious and helpful...they actually only charged us for the burger. We tipped on 100 dollars though since the waiter still needs their tips!.If you do go make sure you ask for a seat on the patio since the water show ( after 3) is AMAZING. We see it every 15 minutes from  our room on the 18th floor..."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I hop you don't go expecting your reservation for outside dining (made 2 weeks in advance) to be honored because you will be sorely disappointed.. My 8 pm reservation put me on a 90 minute to 2 hour wait list.. Hostess staff was indifferent at best.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here for a birthday late lunch. The espresso martini was awesome and the bread was tasty. Then it went downhill. I had a plate of all brown. Really? From a fine dining restaurant? And my friend got the rabbit trio. One of the pieces was bad-tasting  to say the least  overwhelmed with spices. It was all I could taste and it lingered  dominating my palate. The rabbit leg was dry and tiny. Yes  I know rabbits are small  but this was ridiculous. We sent it back and got another twice the size of the previous and cooked properly. I guess they send out crap thinking anyone will eat it since it's from a fancy restaurant. If they had made that effort as an initial effort  I might have been inclined to return. With so much good food out there  this place came up short. And for the price  that's a travesty.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Dined here in August with my fiance and it was AMAZING!   The greek nachos: TO DIE FOR! The trout: INCREDIBLE! The sirloin steak: ORGASMIC!  I really wish I had one of these down here in Miami.   Can't wait to go back.  5 stars! As good as it gets!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place had the perfect seating to the dancing waters fountain show at the Bellagio.   We had good service; Great wine & food. Who knew that Butternut Squash Tortellini could be so good & savory? I had gotten a wonderful sandwich and enjoyed the Olive tapenade. It was a very refreshing meal among good people.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Oh what a beautiful place! I just wish we had gotten there early to get a seat on the patio near the water fountains. Between the four of us  we ordered pasta and steak and it was all great! I love the bread they bring out in the beginning with the olives spread....yummmmm!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A nice setting with great views of the fountain but the food? Meh.  The good: the beef carpaccio appetizer was enormous. Never seen anything like it. Tasty but definitely meant to be shared.   The OK: the mushroom pasta is 'highly recommended' according to the server. Tasty but over cooked  came out as more of tasty  flat noodled goo.   The bad: octopus and squid appetizer. Made with hummus so the char taste of the grilled octopus mixed with the hummus produces a bitter  off putting flavor. Watery  not particularly visually appealing. Note I order grilled octopus wherever possible. I love it and this is not up to standards.   So many great dining options in Vegas. Skip this one
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing food! You should be prepared for a pricey dinner  but the quality of food makes it worth it. Had the tuna tartare & sea scallops. Both were incredible! Best scallops I've had. Yum!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my longtime girlfriends generously treated me to lunch at Olives during our Vegas getaway. The restaurant was comfy  spacious and very posh.   An enormous bread basket kicked off our meal. It came with two types of olive tapenade and some oil-soaked olives. Very schmancy. For lunch  my friend had the scallops which were fantastic  while I had a Caesar salad with ahi tuna which was light enough for lunch but filling enough for someone who was out boozing until all hours the night before.   Although we chose to sit indoors  the balcony tables had the advantage of misters and a stellar view of the Bellagio fountains.   The Stone Cold Fox also known as Todd English wasn't on the line  but I happily daydreamed about him waltzing through the dining room to greet us nonetheless.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food at this place is probably 4 stars.  The ambiance  especially being able to sit outside on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountain show  bumps it up to a 5.   The fig and prosciutto flat bread is excellent as is the bread they bring to your table.  The octopus was disappointing -- a bit rubbery.  The pasta dishes are solid but not anything to write home about.  The mac and cheese also was just ok.    This is a good place to grab a drink before dinner.  If you go early -- around 5pm  you can walk in without a reservation and get a table on the patio so you can watch the fountain show.  Order some drinks and the fig and prosciutto flat bread  and you've got a great time right there.  That is a 5 star experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I once saw Todd English make these insane golden  crusty popovers on tv  and I became a ""fan"" at that moment. I have never tried making any of his recipes  and I don't own one of his cookbooks  but I have been eager to eat at one of his restaurants for years  probably 3 or 4. I had some big expecations  I guess you might say.  Olives delivered on service (we sat at a table in the bar  Chris was helpful and engaging)  ambiance (sexy and modern) and fabulous concept - updated Mediterranean fusion.   However  I felt the menu seemed a little short on variety to me. For a Mediterranean restaurant  I was hoping for more pasta dishes. Chestnuts didn't sound appetizing to me  and the butternut squash ravioli's sounded somehow out of season... kind of heavy for 108 degree Vegas heat. So we ordered the Veal Milanese: rosemary noodles  cipollini onions  whole grain mustard cream  white wine  crazy mushroom ragu  parmesan. It was rich. It was tasty  The noodles were soft  maybe too soft? The cuts of veal looked like chichen strips; I think we both expected them to be more bite-sized and tender than they came out of the kitchen. But the mustard sauce was a real winner. I would try to replicate that at home  wow.  We also had the Bibb lettuce salad  and it was fresh and perfect.  The complimentary 2 olive tapenades  plus olive salad they serve when you are seated is a fabulous way to kickstart the tastebuds. However  they really should work on the breads if they are going to use insanely good olives... a delicious bread with the right texture- that would be an improvement; ours was a little dry. But how can I really complain about a freebie?   For dessert  we ordered the cookie/ice cream sampler  which is an assortment of 3 big cookies  1 macaroon  a piece of fudge  an almond/raspberry bar and a delicious red velvet cupcake with frosting. It also comes with 3 mini scoops of the day's fresh ice creams: we had vanilla bean  strawberry and Bailey's! The cupcake and Bailey's ice cream were the best things on the plate  and at $11 it was a really reasonable pricetag.  This place was great  but I think I'd try one of Todd English's other restaurants before I'd go back to Olives."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I enjoyed my dinner at Olives.  However  with it being such an upscale place  I should have enjoyed the food and service more.  Service was lacking at the beginning  but got better as the meal went on.    We had a 5:15 reservation but be prepared!  We had to wait in line to get seated -- I found that to be odd.    So on to the food -- the foie gras appetizer was divine.  I had the gnocci and chicken  and there was scarcely 3 tiny pieces of chicken in the dish.  They were so small I had to hunt for them.  My partner had the sea bass  and that looked and tasted good  but the beans that accompanied the dish was weird.  The entire meal with tip was $191.  I probably will never go back there when I'm in Vegas again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This review is for Saturday night on Labor Day weekend  2014.   Our server Paul (if I remember correctly) was funny and attentive. We arrived at 6PM with a 645 reservation. When we arrived at 6  the lady said there was a wedding rehearsal dinner in the patio until 8 but would willingly give us a table out there if they finished early. Luckily their rehearsal ended around 7pm and we were given a table outside for 6. The reservation was for my parents 30th anniversary and we really wanted the patio table. I previously read how hard it was to get one so in the end it was so worth it because the view and ambiance was just outstanding.   We ordered the beef carpaccio and smoked salmon flatbread for appetizers and the beef carpaccio was AMAZING.. I had the mushroom pappardelle and it was a little on the heavy side but aside from that--it tasted on the good average side. My dad had the mushroom risotto added on to his steak. Let me tell you--I love risotto! The texture was good  tasted cheesy and made pretty well. The lamb lollipop was amazing. Tender  soft and tasty. It was made RIGHT. We also ordered the Chilean sea bass and my brother in law had no complaints. Said it was good. In the end of our dinner  our server brought out a couple of mini choux with ""happy anniversary"" written in beautiful hand writing. My parents loved the dinner and enjoyed the show. Took many breathtaking pictures with the fountain show. But I got to say--if it wasn't for the patio seating granting us a good view of the fountain show  I would probably not return since the taste was a little above average but not good enough to be this overpriced.  I enjoyed dinner at Olives and would definitely come back again (for the view) BUT  i do have some cons:  1) When I called to make a reservation  the lady on the phone was pretty rude rushing me off the phone just because I asked if they do floral arrangement for dinner and asked her for patio seating &she said ""let me tell you..when you get here you ask for patio. If you want flowers ask concierge."" She was trying to be nice for the sake of her job but I can tell from her tone of voice that she wanted me off the phone ASAP.  2) Patio seating should be reservable. It would take a lot less effort for customers so customers would not have to worry if they would be able to get a patio seat for special occasions."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,After my second great experience  once in 2008 & second a few days ago  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone who asks where they should go in Vegas.   If you get there early you can sit on the patio area and have an amazing view of the water show.  I'm not a big meat eater in general  but their Beef Carpaccio is a must for an appetizer to share.  My family and friends like to share everything when we eat out  so I would say I have tried most of the menu at this point.   Their pastas are delicious.  The pasta with truffle shavings was tasty and so was the shrimp & cheese gnocchi.   The rib-eye is best medium rare so if it comes more cooked send it back.   Our waiter Rust took care of it right away.  My friend said she thought it was just as tasty as Kobe beef in Japan!  The scallops are great too.  Oh  the bread basket and olive spreads are fantastic!  Be careful not to eat too much of it because it will fill you up fast.   Also  save room for at least a tasty white chocolate key lime truffle. Yum!    The wine list is incredible with many boutique wines such as Williams Selyem.  They will not allow you to bring wine that is on their list for corkage so double check when you call.   The Sommelier came out to greet us and she helped us pair a great dessert wine with their foie gras dish.   We met the head chef too!  What a young and accomplished guy.  The restaurant manager even came by the table and said hi to us.   The service was fantastic and if you experienced any less just let them know.   Our server Rust took great care of us.    Definitely a memorable place to go when you happen to be in Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is good  service is good  dessert is excellant  but it's all about the view! Patio seating with front row views of the Bellagio fountain show!  Superb dining experience!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I stay at Bellagio often  and walk past Olives and always wanted to try it.  They have a cute patio!! We didn't sit there because it was a little warm out when we went  but it overlooks the fountains and looks like a great view.  We made reservations for a Sunday night and got seated quickly.  Our server came and was wonderful! She was very attentive and helpful.  We started off with drinks and the grilled octopus appetizer.  I order grilled octopus a lot and this one had a delicious chickpea addition to it.  I LOVED IT.  I warn you  it doesn't sound or look particularly delicious  but it really was. We ordered the pork chop and salmon entrees  and both were SOO good.  Both were cooked perfectly to what we asked for and the entire dish was amazing.  Although it was a bit on the pricier side  it is definitely recommended!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!  Great ambiance!  Great service! Great food!  The marinated olives were a lovely starting point.  I ordered the Chilean sea bass and it was great!  I tried my friends steak and it honestly melted in my mouth.  We had two bottles of wine at dinner and both were fabulous.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was recommended to us by one of the servers at our pool.  We had late reservations and were able to sit outside and watch the fountain show throughout dinner.  We started with the tuna tartare and the greek salad.  It was like heaven in my mouth.  It was probably the best tartare I had ever had.  Yum.  My mouth is watering talking about it.  Then we kind of shared the sea bass  scallops  and the portobello flatbread....all of it was really good.  Of course  we had great ambience because we were watching the fountain show the whole time.  The only thing that I really didnt like was that you had to go out and use the Bellagio bathrooms.  They also had a really good bread bowl too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went see Curtis my favorite bartender in LV. Stayed for a Greek salad and a drink. Very delicious and fresh tasting. And Curtis is there.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is my favorite go to spot in Vegas.  The pineapple martini's are to die for  beef carpaccio is always so tender and flavorful and the spicy chicken flat bread is one of my favorites!  Add in the ambiance of the fountains at Bellagio and Olives is a must visit.  Can't wait to go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,In the Bellagio hotel. I made reservation through Yelp for 7:30 amd even though there was a crowd at the door we were seated on time. Reservations a must here. Well made Martinis good wine selection. I had the Scallops which can be hard to cook just right but these were the best I have ever had. Great view of the fountains if you sit outside or by the window. Nice olive pate and olives served with crisp flat bread upon seating.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,From appetizer to entree  everything was delicious. The fried Mac-n-cheese was amazing!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is my second time coming here for lunch and it was delicious!  Todd English Olives is located across from Tiffany's and really close to the side Valet.  Super easy in & out!  We sat our on the patio  when it was like 90-100 degrees.  There weren't any misters on yet and the fountains NEVER went off during our entire hour+ lunch.  Kind of a bummer.  Service was pretty good.  The server forgot my guests drink twice  but it was quickly replenished when we brought it up.  I ordered: Chilled Crab Salad mixed greens  asparagus  shaved fennel  cucumber  roma tomato  red onion  mandarin segments  red pepper coulis  champagne vinaigrette.....$17 *It was perfect for a super hot day!  My guest ordered a flatbread and really enjoyed it.  I also ordered a flavored iced tea that was really good (maybe it was peach?)  I would definitely come back here- very good for a business lunch!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English's Olives (located within the immaculate Bellagio hotel and Casino) is by far my favorite eatery in Las Vegas and the only venue I insure a visit every single time I jaunt out to the Vegas desert. The Contemporary Olives features a Mediterranean inspired menu including pastas  steaks  rotisserie dishes  and brick oven pizza's all which are set against the breathtaking Lake Bellagio where guests can enjoy a gravity defying water dance. This venue does take reservations but not for the outside patio  which is the only seat in the house as far as I'm concerned. Take my advice and expect to linger a little while; grab a cocktail at the bar  it is well worth the wait. The only negative comment I possess about this venue was due to an experience I endured on my last visit (evening of June 10th  2009). Upon my arrival the at the hostess desk  I was made to feel as if I was inconveniencing the hostess by asking to be placed on the list for table service on the outside patio. She claimed that no persons were going to be seated on the patio due to the wind picking up and then went back to her business without even offering to seat me indoors. I am not usually treated with such disrespect and was actually considering leaving my favorite venue. I reluctantly swallowed my pride  walked back to the counter and politely asked to obtain a seat indoors. Needless to say twenty minutes later our sweet waitress accommodated my boyfriend and me  moving us out to the outside patio in perfect coordination with our entrees. Besides the rather rude hostess  I have no negative opinions in regards to this establishment whatsoever; I simply adore every item I have ever chosen to indulge. Since I have dined at this venue numerous times and have come across no unsatisfactory dishes  I will walk you through some of my favorites:  Appetizer:      Oysters on the half shell served with a raspberry minuet nestled atop a bed of rock salt. The pairing of the sweet raspberry and the savory oyster meat is superb; I would have never thought these two components would pair so fabulously.       Beef Carpaccio served with polenta  Roquefort Crema  shaved parmesan  and Cipollini onions. I find most Capriccios to be over salted  however this dish is seasoned to perfection. The beef is so thinly sliced it melts in your mouth  and the occasional Cipollini onion adds a nice kick of salt to satisfy your taste buds  absolutely fabulous!      Sweet Potato flat bread served with sliced sweet potato  caramelized onions  Capicola ham  roasted scallions  all topped with an apple cider glaze. The sweetness of the sweet potato marries magnificently with the saltiness of the Capicola ham; one of my taste buds favorite pairings is the combination of sweet and salty and this dish hit the spot to a T. The flat bread is thin and crispy so when you bite into this dish you get a nice crunch that doesn't over power the flavors of the toppings.  Entrees:      Pan Roasted Mahi Mahi accompanied with a Shrimp Scampi Risotto  toasted garlic chips  and topped with a crispy Pasta and Micro green insalata mixed with an aged balsamic vinaigrette. This is a healthy portion so make sure you have an appetite when ordering this dish. The Mahi Mahi is delicate and flaky and pairs perfectly with the saltiness of the Risotto and the crunch of the garlic chips. The Micro Green Insalata adds an earthy flavor to the fish that rounds out the flavors in your mouth  yummy!      Grilled Pork Tenderloin served aside a smoked goat cheese polenta  bacon braised collard greens  red wine glaze  and crisp mini onion rings. My boyfriend orders this dish every single time we dine at olives and I gladly help him indulge in about a quarter of it. This very healthy portioned dish comes with three juicy  cooked to perfection pork tenderloins. The smoked goat cheese polenta just might be the best thing I have ever tasted  creamy and salty with a rich goat cheese flavor!  Every element in this dish pairs excellently  the juiciness of the pork  the crunch of the onion ring  the smokiness of the collared greens  and the richness of the polenta; I always try to obtain one of every element on my fork to conclude in the best bite every time. If you love your mouth you will reward it by indulging in this dish  you can't go wrong!  Desert:    Banana Bread Tiramisu  paired with a creamy espresso this is the perfect way to end any meal. The tiramisu is light with chocolate chips scattered throughout and a wonderful but not overpowering banana taste.     Flourless chocolate cake served with a tart yet sweet raspberry sauce. The richness of the chocolate cake is cut by the tartness of the raspberry sauce  very satisfactory!  Olives is a fabulous venue in which to dine. I recommend coming here for a quiet and romantic dinner with your loved one. The wait staff is always a pleasure  food portions are guaranteed to fill your appetite  and the gravity defying water show is guaranteed to impress!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This review is long overdue. I absolutely love this restaurant. This is my Vegas favorite! Every time we are in town I have to have dinner here and if it was up to me I would dine here every night. The service is spot on with the friendly staff and attentive servers. The food is amazing. The bread and olive spread they serve before dinner is to die for! And being able to sit on the patio is always a huge plus (or sometimes we ask for a table with a window view to see the water fountain show  usually after 6). Love it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I had our last lunch as an engaged couple here on the afternoon of our wedding. It was incredible. We were seated at a beautiful table on the patio. If you didn't know  the patio is next to the Bellagio fountains so you get to see the show as well. The only warning I have is that if the wind comes up  you will get overspray. It reminded me of going to see Shamu as a kid. The bad part is that our flatbread went limp and my Maker's Mark Manhattan got some water in it. Sacrilige!!!!  We were treated so nicely here. The food and service were top notch.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,no people. its not all about the buffets in vegas.  this place truly helped me live out my life's motto: good food  good company= good night!!  the tuna carpaccio was amazing. actually all the food was really good  came in heavy portions so dont overstuff yourselves with the amazing bread and tapenede they provide you at the beginning.   as helen s mentioned. the truffle oil that was requested as a side of the fries was an ahhhhhhmazing side that complimented the fries!   but by far  the best part of this restaurant was being able to sit on the other side of the bellagio watershow ... what a breattaking view!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,best olives I ever had!  We had the calamari  beef carpaccio and seabass  all very delicious.  We went with a group of 7  it was a work dinner.  We were all having a good time  talking  laughing  weren't being obnoxious or anything  and the hostess came by and told us that she wants to ensure others can enjoy their dinner  so pretty much telling us to be quiet  which we all thought was so inappropriate.  It's not like we haven't been to other nice restaurants and that other parties weren't at the same talking levels as us.  But anyway  food and the waiter was good  but the night ended on a bad note  so rude!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is one of my favorite restaurants for dining outside.  I love it!  We visited several weeks ago while gambling and shopping at the Bellagio.  Luckily  it was a week day  and we were able to sit on the patio without a reservation.  I enjoyed the special flatbread of the day-escargot and goat cheese.  Blissful!  I love  love  love the olives  spreads  and breads that they serve before the meal.  Wish I could transport myself to the patio right now for another stunning meal!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First off - if you can get a table outside  PLEASE do.  We had Paul as a server and he was the absolute best.  We ended up having a late reservation here since we wanted a table outside to see the Bellagio Fountain show.  When we got seated  we were at a table that could see the show but we were more towards the back. We got a bottle of wine and ordered the beef carpaccio to start with.   This is quite a hefty appetizer and PERFECT if it's a warm night outside since it's cold. By far some of the best I've had ever.  We decided to skip the main course since we had an appetizer while waiting for our table to open up and went for the banana tiramisu. HIGHLY recommend. It was a wonderful mix of banana  cream  chocolate  dark chocolate and it was perfect.   Before we ordered dessert  a table had opened up in the front row of the patio absolutely PERFECT to see the show and Paul moved us closer without even hesitating.  His great service and thoughtfulness made our night along with the ambiance and good food.  Overall- Olives was a good choice for us.  It's a little pricey but hey  that's Vegas :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The decision to come here was based purely on our coincidental proximity to the entrance when our lunch hunger statistic went critical.  We were seated promptly and given what was some simply fantastic assorted bread.  The breads were all warm  soft  and fresh  and included a particularly yummy type I would guess is called onion-topped foccacia.  Amazingly enough  the bread was not the star of the complimentary appetizers.  They also brought out a dish with black and green olives and olive spread in the same two varieties.  The green one was enjoyable enough with quite a bit of natural kick  but the black one was pure magic.  It was almost like like secretly mixed butter into it.  I'm completely full right now but somehow this is still making me drool.  We ordered the portabello mushroom panini and the butternut squash tortelli.   Both were particularly fresh and pleasant; the pasta was probably a bit inbalanced with the few bites that had enough cheese on them being the better ones.  A very nice surprise was the fried pickles that came with the panini.  Don't cringe - these were plenty mild  probably because of the frying  and when dipped in the provided mustard sauce generated a little dose of magic.  Service was very prompt and attentive  and our only regret was that we couldn't eat more.  We came in with no expectations  and left plenty happy and only about $40 poorer after tip.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So maybe if they sat us on the terrace to take in the water show the Seafood Risotto would've tasted better.  Not sure.....probably not.  Gross!  The Risotto had a taste to it I couldn't really identify  like a lemony  sourness and the seafood was salty and just wrong.  Didn't even finish it.  The Blueberry Cheesecake earned them that second star.  So sick of expensive restaurants with sub-par food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great location with a view of the Bellagio fountains! This little gem is located in the shopping area of Bellagio and we celebrated a Bachlorette dinner here over Halloween weekend.  Food: I recommend their Butternut Squash Tortellini!! It's SO good! Also  my friends got the Carpaccio  Octopus Salad and the steak and they were all yummy :)  We did a superheroine/supervillains theme for Halloween and the restaurant surprised the bride to be with an amazing dessert showing Wonder Woman (her costume) with Superman. It was such a cute touch and a great way to end dinner!  Service: Good and fast  even during crowded Halloween night  Ambiance: Try to get a fountain view seat
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We decided to try a fancy restaurant this Vegas trip. Olives was our pick. The atmosphere upon arrival is very classy and romantic. They offer outside seating that over looks the Bellagio fountains. The wait for outside was an hour more than our reservation  so we stuck with our inside table. Our table had a decent view of the fountains.  The service here was awesome! Our server Ralph was very knowledgeable and eager to help. The wine guy (not sure of his official title) Adam was awesome too. I remembered having an awesome glass of wine at the bellagio previously and he was so helpful in finding it for us!    We started with the polenta and it was quite good. I decided to splurge and order the rib eye steak special  which was $50!! Others in my party ordered the goat cheese raviolis and the beef tenderloin. I wasn't blown away with my choice. I was hoping for the price tag I'd devour my meal. Unfortunately  that wasn't the case. My other friend that ordered the beef wasn't uber impressed either. The raviolis were awesome though. After lots of food and two bottles of the most fabulous wine  we passed on dessert. The dessert menu was hard to pass up  but there was simply no room left in my belly!   I would give this place a 2nd chance for sure  the overall experience was awesome. A must for a special occasion or romantic dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Had reservations on a summer Sunday evening. We got hungry before  so we just arrived early and were seated right away on the balcony. It was hot  but to me  tolerable.   (Note to those who want a balcony seat  there are like 4 two-person tables  and then a handful of 4-person tables. i.e.  it's a very limited number. When we initially asked for reservations for a balcony seat  the hostess told me that they don't guarantee balcony seats  but when we arrive  we can request a balcony seat and wait it out. We did not try to ask our casino host to try so i don't know if that route would help.)  For starters  I got the Belgium Endive salad with brie and bosc pears. It was alright ... a little bland. The brie was really good though and I really like endive. I really wanted to try the fig and prosciutto flatbread  but we knew it would have been too much food. Next time ...  For my entree  I got the ribeye with the chedder croquets. The steak was pretty good  even though the meat was a tad on the medium-well side even though I ordered medium. It also came with some vege and two onion rings  which were useless  bland  and too much oil and batter. If this was top chef  Tom might say it something just thrown on there that didn't add to the dish at all.  My dining companion ordered the porterhouse with the ""lobster and ham mac and cheese."" There was one piece of lobster and the pasta they used was like an orzo  which is kind of an annoying pasta to me  unless it's a salad. (personal opinion). But it tasted pretty great. I just wish there was MORE of it!  As the other reviewers stated  the bread basket and the olive tapenade were delish. No complaints there. I will likely return to try some of the other dishes as they sound really great!  For dessert  we got the banana tiramisu. It was pretty good as well. Not a mindblowing dessert. We did eat it all ;)  Atmosphere on the balcony was pretty quiet and nice  except for the table behind us that had children watching DVDs on a portable player with no headphones? Come on parents ... tsk tsk."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent food.   Excellent service.  Russ is awesome!   Drinks were always full.  Great view of the fountain.   Did I mention the food was great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My poor experience at this restaurant started before we even arrived. I called ahead to let them know we had a reservation for 7 people and were coming to celebrate a special event. The woman on the phone (named Nicole) was rude and dismissive. She responded to me with ok?..... as if she was unsure what she was supposed to do with the information. Her rude and condescending tone was frustrating. It should have been an indicator of what the restaurant experience would involve.  The waitstaff was mediocre. Doing the bare minimum and never with a pleasant demeanor. The food was average to good  but over priced for the quality. They do have an extensive wine list from which to chose.   I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that are delicious and provide exemplary service. Don't waste your time or money here. You can definitely do better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had an 8pm reservation.  Were seated right away and got a balcony seat. Which I had read was difficult to achieve. So we were very pleased about our table! Paul was our waiter  he was personable and efficient!  Plus we really liked him! They need to describe the salads better. The one I chose had prosciutto on the top of the salad and I didn't see that listed in the ingredients.  It could have been there I just didn't notice.  Took it off the top and ate the salad anyway.  My husband had a different salad that was more Mediterranean and he liked it a lot. He ordered the corn ravioli  which he liked but I didn't.  I had a salmon dish that was Amazing!  All in all a very good dining experience.  Plus we had an excellent view of the fountains!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is one of those reviews where you wish Yelp allowed for half star ratings as I would give Olives 3 1/2 stars if I could.  The whole dinning experience was hit and miss.  I liked how they let you use the iPad to review the wine menu  a nice touch.  I also liked the restaurants nice ambience and quieter noise level then so many of the locations on the strip.  We had requested a view of the water show via our OpenTable reservation request but did not receive such a view.  We were advised that would require an additional wait time  no thanks.  Our server while nice and observant  he also made me feel rushed as if he was more focused on quickly turning the table.  Getting back to the wine  the first bottle we ordered did not taste right  the wine steward while willing to replace it was also willing to point out that the bottle we felt did not taste right was fine  aka we made a bad choice in selecting...  Anyways  we ordered the calamari and octopus appetizer.  I liked how it was grilled versus fried.  The flavor was good albeit a bit salty.  For entrees we ordered scallops and the halibut.  Sadly the scallops were undercooked and the sauce on it was very salty.  I was too tired and hungry to send the scallops back  so I called it sashimi and kept eating.  The halibut was good with a nice light taste.  For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate souffle and it had a nice flavor.  Clearly this restaurant is in a prime location and can rely on that to get customers.  But for the price point the hit and miss evening really should have included more hits!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Finally tried Olives at the Bellagio.  My husband and I love Mediterranean food and we love hummus and butternut squash ravioli.  We were seated right away and the service was great. We were brought a yummy assortment of olives and a basket of olive bread and crusty parmesan crisps (both very tasty).  This afternoon we ordered the Greek salad and Hummus to start off. The Greek salad was one of the best that I have ever had and I order it a lot at various restaurants. The hummus  however  looked delicious but had way too much Cumin in it (I'm pretty positive it was Cumin)... it ruined what should have been a delicious beginning.   We ordered the Butternut squash Tortelli and the Scallops  which came on a bed of Risotto. The scallops were good but the risotto was just acceptable and nothing to write home about. The Tortelli  on the other hand  was definitely forgettable. The sauce tasted like a beef gravy and you would never know there was butternut squash in the pasta... it was disappointing.  Because the Greek Salad and breads were so incredible  I would give Olives another chance and hope that other menu selections are better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Always great food! For lunch I had the steak sandwich with thinly sliced onion rings. My wife had scallops with risotto.  Each dish was amazing and full of flavor.  Our service was adequate and timely. I enjoy dining here for special occasions.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food and great service! If it's a nice day  ask to be seated on the patio. You can see the fountain show from a different angle.  The bread basket is awesome. They have about 4 different kinds of breads - some type of sourdough  some sort of baguette  a paper thin Parmesan-topped crisp  and this awesome onion olive oil herb bread. The breads are also served with kalamata tapenade  green olive tapenade  and whole olives.  The daily special was a grilled swordfish topped with shrimp  over a bed of couscous. Excellent dish. The couscous was warm and popped in my mouth with sun dried tomatoes and golden raisins. The grilled swordfish was a hefty sized portion with all the juices locked in. You don't even need a knife.  The Olives Burger is big  juicy  and delicious. All the ingredients are extremely fresh and at the peak of their flavors. The fries are wedges and are crisp and hot when they come to your table.   Our water was refilled  my hot tea pot was refilled  and the waitress had a friendly smile throughout the meal. Oh yea  their orange juice is fresh squeezed. Yum!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Did not enjoy at all.  Mix up with the reservation meant they gave our table to someone else.  The food was mediocre...I had 1/2 gnocchi 1/2 tortellini. Friends had the prosciutto flatbread and it was cold. All food had way too much salt.    2 stars because we got free dessert for the mix up with the tables...but the dessert wasn't that great either (Banana tiramisu.. tastes a lot like a boring banana bread).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Where else can you watch Bellagio's water show and chow down on the best beef carpaccio ever!?  Grab a seat close to the window and let your eyes and tongue feast!  Expect to spend mucho grande $$$$ though  but hey you're in Vegas.  Try the mushroom pasta.  The flavor is rich and it'll def fill you up.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic service; great wine and food.  Ask to sit on veranda or by windows for view of the fountains.m
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First things first! MAKE RESERVATIONS and if you want to eat on the patio  which you should  come EARLY (10 minutes?) and check in  there will be a line to eat out on the patio (even with reservations).  Our reservations were a 5pm (when they open) and we were seating in one of the 4 table on the patio that is along the wall over looking the Bellagio water show. Waiter was excellent  charismatic and honest with helping us choose our meals!!   Husband and I shared  with all the eating in Vegas  2 full meals was just too much! We started with a Caesar was good  but not the best I have ever had. We also enjoyed the basket of complimentary bread  there were 3 kinds served with an olive spread and olives. Our main dish was the chicken with a side of broccoli rabe  VERY flavorful and yummy. We also got aside of the truffle mac and cheese (lacked flavor  but liked the crunchy outside) and tempura green beans.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Since Prime Steakhouse was NOT WELCOMING  we alighted upon Olives and sat at the bar with bartender Chris  who was warm  welcoming and as responsive and attentive as one human being can be toward another.  We weren't overly hungry so we ordered the salad of the day  the bread basket and the charcuterie platter with the Whispering Angel Rose wine.  Everything was absolutely wonderful and perfect in every way.  Chris could not have been more solicitous  and the place was busy too  and attentive to our needs.  We had a wonderful time and would go back again and again.  Thank you Chris for restoring our faith in bar and restaurant servers.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It isn't a trip to Vegas for me without dinner at Todd English's Olives   Our meal was excellent as always.   A draw back is the restaurant is noisy so if you are looking for a quiet dinner for two  this will not be the place.   If you are looking for a fastastic meal you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,By far one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas.  We come here at least once every trip.   I had the porterhouse steak - sounds like a lot  and it was  but it had the bone in it too.  Amazing and perfectly cooked steak  served over their version of mac & cheese (it was really more like a risotto)  spinach  and a red wine glaze.  Frisee topped the steak.  It had lobster too - but only ONE piece.  I mean  one tiny piece.  That was disappointing.  They should have left that 'detail' off the menu.  Anyway  aside from the lobster  the rest of the plate was absolutely delicious.  All that was left was the bone.  Heh  heh...  Hubby ordered the pan seared sea bass.  I don't remember what else was on the plate  but the sauce had a light citrus taste to it  and it really made the meat of the fish sing.  It was really  really good.  Not as good as my steak... but that's me.  Another excellent meal.  Can't wait to go back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A very classy joint with excellent ambiance - we recently had the chance to dine here while in las vegas. The complimentary bread was quite good  and the service was attentive. Most of all  the pasta and flatbread pizza were top notch. I ordered the wild boar bolognese - pasta topped with mascarpone and ground boar meat. Although I was initially skeptical (mascarpone is usually found in tiramisu)  the flavors blended quite well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Make a reservation a week in advance for 9pm then arrive and be told a table ""may"" be available at 10.30 ? I don't think so !"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Like much of LV Celeb Chef owned it is wildly overpriced for some very skimpy and pedestrian quality the longer they stay open.. 3 rib lamb chops 1/2"" thick $45. Definitely once frozen and borderline taste due to age either before or after freezing Chile Seabass $45. I see one review saying the same about the Sea Bass. I have been there 3 times before over the years and was always good but the last 2 were not good "
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Found a cockroach as long as your middle finger on the floor. Their sea scallop has lots of sand. Service was really good though
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,DELICIOUS!!!! Like seriously good!! Definitely will be returning.  White chocolate martini  walnut salad  chicken entree and a side of Mac and cheese that hubby and I split. He had a ravioli dish as his entree and it was also quite fabulous! If you like high quality food ... Like chef prepared... You will enjoy this restaurant for sure!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"5.1  i sooo wish i was in vegas right now so i could sink my teeth into that heavenly seared foie gras w/ duck confit & chicken w/ baby greens.. ugh.. yummm! sitting out in the veranda made dinner that much more enjoyable.. music & water show paired with great food & great service.. & being with my lovies.. what more could you ask for? this has got to be one of my best dining experiences  ever! a must-go when in vegas.. i cannot wait to go back!   = )   (this review actually raised the standards by which i give out ""the stars"")"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made a reservation a few months ago for 8pm. Arrived at 7:30 to get on the list for the patio. Told to come back at 9:15pm. That was a bit ridiculous. Went to Spago at Caesars for Happy Hour. Returned to Olives and seated on the patio. Things started out great with an excellent table at the railing. Nice wine recommendation. Enjoyable charcuterie board. Down hill from there. Took another 30 minutes to receive our food. Food was cold and one dish was too salty to eat. Would have complained to server but she never came back. Never poured wine from our bottle. Never checked in on food. After we finished eating  we waited another 15 minutes for plates to be cleared. Never saw waitress again until we asked for the check. Took another 10 minutes to get our check returned. I would not call this place high-end. Go for the view but that's about it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were greeted quickly and the hostess was very friendly.  They accomodated my request to sit outside on Christmas day and even moved the heater away because I was too warm.  The view of the fountains at the Bellagio were a beautiful backdrop to a wonderful Christmas brunch.  The waitress was great and seems to really like her job.    The food - oh my - everything was tasty and I could have just sat there all day eating....watching the fountains  drinking wine  watching the birds play in the pine tree  and eating.  We shared a ham and asparagus flatbread and a ricotta ravioli dish for a starter.  Bother were very good and could have been a meal! My husband's flank steak and my chicken roulade were tasty.   I still can't believe it but we forced ourselves to have a dessert.  The waitress promised a wheelchair if I could not stand after eating so much.  She was a wonderful waitress.  I had an eggnog pot de creme and the husband had a chocolate molten cake.  Yum.  My only suggestion would be to put the fabulous vanilla icre cream on the side because it competed with the pot de creme.   Great service and great food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I always order their carpaccio. Very simple dish and delicious. The flatbreads are okay  a little bland; pasta dishes are decent. Great lunch spot.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'm giving this place 3 stars only because of the problem with the hostess.   Our reservation was for 8pm and our TABLE was NOT READY. The hostess was RUDE. We had reservations and had specifically asked for a table by the window to see the water show. She told us that we couldn't have the table because another party  who had been waiting for over an hour  was getting the table. I told her that we had reserved the table earlier that day (at least 2.5 hours prior) and specifically asked to sit by the window. She said that we had to wait at least another 30 minutes and after then  they'll see. After our reservation and waiting for at least 30 minutes  if a table by the window became available  we could have it.   The manager tried to accommodate us after about 20 minutes passed our reservation time. We NEVER GOT THE TABLE BY THE WINDOW  which was the ONLY reason we wanted to try this place. The service  once at the table  was good. The food was yummy. I would go back again  if I didn't have to deal with the reservation problem.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Terrible. Soggy  tasteless pasta. Dry lamb. Service excellent  the Bellagio fountains in the background; wonderful  but the food was so bad I'd never go back. Can't think of another $100+ meal being worse.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was absolutely delicious. Their service was marvelous and the view from our table was simply magnificent. We went here for our Christmas dinner and had our table near the patio glass wall. We could view the bellagio fountain  the Eiffel tower from there.   Okay so food wise  I loved the gnocchi. And definitely try their free appetizer place of olives and bread. Its really tasty and quite unique.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'll cut straight to the point: Kobe steak tartare. The greatest piece of raw food that ever entered my mouth. I was not alone in this sentiment - the other three gentlemen in our group for dinner completely agreed that this tartare was unbelievable. In fact  as good as my duck confit was (aside from being a bit oversalted  but I expected as much since it was deliciously combined with capers and anchovies)  I would've preferred 3 entire orders of tartare in lieu of an actual entree - its that good!   In addition to the delicious food  the view of the fountains and the outdoor seating (with heat lamps  of course) in December makes for a pretty decent outing. The girls in our group were a bit chilled until we shifted table spots to make them closest to the heat  but aside from that everything was delectable and enjoyable about the meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One star for the table with an epic view of the fountain. One star for agreeing to seat us 20 min early. One star for the delish basket of bread and olive tapenade. But sadly  that's it. Food was  and I don't use this word lightly  tasteless. Specifically  the brick pressed chicken - it's what you would expect from a bad banquet. My recommendation  go here to have a drink or two and enjoy the fountain...then eat elsewhere. You can do much  much better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Professional somewhat sophisticated atmosphere in the Bellagio strip of eateries that specializes in Mediterranean cuisine  I got the scallops and they tasted like filet mingon  the wait staff was very knowledgable and had a wine expert on hand to recommend a nice but cheap (hey i'm not rich) bottle for the table.  Try to get seating towards the lake and not the people walking by in the mall area.  Not cheap but for a good occasion it is worth it
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love this place for the good location and great view of the Bellagio water fountain! I've been here twice and both times with a group of 5-6 people. The restaurant is great for couples as well as groups. The bread is so wonderful but I miss the olive bread they used to serve several years ago. They do have great bread served with olive spreads that are so yummy. Service was terrific.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Subtle  seemingly-simple dishes with pleasantly complex flavors.  This was the best meal I had in Vegas  to be honest.  It should also be noted that I hate olives  but the olive butter (was it butter? does it matter?) was surprisingly good for being made of  presumably  99% mashed olives.  The portion sizes were good also; frequently in my brief visit to Vegas the dinners were just huge and felt wasteful  but not here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service 5 stars Atmosphere 5 for outside/3 for inside. Food 4 stars. I have a hard time getting used to idea of a 4$ restaurant in the mall.  We were seated in the front  which had an open wall to the mall.  On the other hand  the dining outside looked awesome-do yourself a favor & wait the extra 20 minutes to be seated there.  Fig flatbread was good  crab rissotto great. Large servings.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate her 11-25-13 for lunch and it was extravaganza for our tastebuds ..my wife was in olive bliss and my wifes ravioli sent zings through her head and mine also .I had a pasta dish that was very good and the waiter kept my tea glass full at all times and i drink very fast.. I would give this place 10 stars if i could .its off the charts as far as pasta goes and the ravioli which we planned on just being good was above and beyond what you can imagine..i have had ravioli a lot of very good restaurants and at this place you will  not be disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The wifey and I had a great lunch on the patio overlooking the Bellagio lake.  We started with (and recommend getting) the fig and prosciutto flat bread.  It's heavy on figs  but you can toss those to the side.  After that I enjoyed my steak sandwich.  Can't go wrong here for a casual lunch.  Service was great too.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really liked the table out on the balcony overlooking the fountain.  The server was excellent. Food was mediocre at best with Vegas level prices of course. Also it was a little slow coming out but I don't mind a leisurely meal;   Better than rushing me though like its Disney or something.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,i've only been here once and it was a few yrs ago. From what i remember i enjoyed everything  from food to atmosphere. It was an unfortunate that we didnt get to sit by the window and watch the bellagio fountain while we eat  that would have been a bonus.  Till this day  all i can think of is their artichoke salad. It was SOOO freaking good. I sometimes still crave for that salad in which i cannot find anywhere else. I believe it was a special dish for that evening when i went. Whenever I walk by Olives when i'm at vegas  i dont see the artichoke salad on the menu anymore. Anyway  the salad was a small portion  it was very light in the sauce  but at the same time it was very flavorful. I remember there was a buttery taste? actually i'll take that back  i dont even remember and i dont want to say the wrong thing... all i know is that it was really good and that i wish i can have that right now in front of me.   we also ordered a flatbread  that was tasty too. Tha'ts all i can say  i dont remember what i even order.  Oh well  i guess this gives me an excuse to go back to Olives and try other dishes so i can update my review.  :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Always love coming here. My first time here was a few months back...I was fortunate enough to be served by Gray on the terrace. She was amazing and an instant favorite of mine. Everytime I've been back I've asked for her  but she's been off...dammit. Service otherwise has been good  never had any issues. Either way  food has always been good  great views from the terrace  and I always leave happier (and less sober) than when I came in (I do generally polish off a bottle of wine of course!).   The tuna and beef carpaccio was definitely worth getting. The grilled octopus and squid were great as well  but I may see about requesting no squid/extra octopus. The charcuterie plate was nice  but I'm not sure if I would order it again by myself...I did it with the previously mentioned bottle and while the selection was good  for one person it felt intimidating. Definitely with another person with me (but I don't like people  so  no). :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food is decent  but service was slow  and prices for appetizers and salads are unjustifiably high
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When in Vegas please go and dine at Olives!   What a wonderful way to spend an evening.  Dining alfresco  behind the magical dancing fountains at Bellagio.   The food is fantastic  the staff (especially Bobby) is amazing.   Please make a reservation  but plan on arriving a good half hour to hour before if you would like to dine on the patio.  My 7:15 reservation turned into. 9 pm seating  but the staff advised us and kept us updated.  It is totally worth it.  The cookie butter creme brulee is amazing!   A date night that will be talked about till our next visit.   Thank you!   It was perfect!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This by far is my favorite place to eat in Las Vegas. The green beans are the best you will ever eat and that is no lie. When I asked about a good beer paring with my salmon the waiter looked a little puzzled  which was fine. Eat here and you will not be disappointed. Also make sure you make a reservation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,With all the great restaurants in Vegas why anyone would go here is beyond me. The prices were high (I do not mind paying for quality food)  and the food was mediocore.  I am being generous with those comments.  Service was average Find another place to go.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Whenever I come to Vegas this isn't first stop to grab a late lunch. I usually love this place although yesterday was a complete disappointment. The food was just awful. The Cesar salad came out wilted and the tomatoes were not fresh  they were pruney and appeared days old. The chicken was dry and tasted like it had been sitting under hot lights for hours. The food was clearly not fresh and even the pizza which is hard to mess up tasted bland and boring. It's sad but olives has lost it's luster. This won't be my first stop anymore  it's sad to see a good restaurant fall off in quality and taste.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,No bueno. Esp in Vegas I've had better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had dinner at Olives in late June.  Our server Sabine  was exceptional.  The hostess sat us at a great table  on the window (it was 115 out that day so no thank you to outdoor seating)  great view of the fountains.  We really enjoyed our meal and the service.     Cocktails were good: Martini $18 White wine - $14  We ordered the Corvina $47.00.  The fish was a bit overcooked but very good.  The flatbread $18.00 which was huge but delicious.   And the tortellini for $28.00 which was good.   Probably wouldn't order the fish again but definitely the flatbread and a pasta dish.    Service is not hurried and gracious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We just enjoyed a light dinner here about a month ago! I was very surprised to find it so packed on a Monday night  so of course there was not a chance of us getting a seat out on the patio or just a fountain view  but we still asked anyways!   The lighting in here is very dim  like most other fine dining experiences in Vegas! Typically  I don't enjoy being seated so close to other diners  but in this case I didn't mind (probably had something to do with the very entertaining older drunk couple next to us though)! I hate to stare  but sometimes you can't help yourself...they were downright drunk and funny!   They start you out with some different breads and olive spreads....this is great  by the way! We shared the Prosciutto and Fig Flat bread and the Squid & Calamari as an appetizer. The Flat bread was very fresh and interesting  but we weren't too fond of the appetizer. We both thought the squid paired with the chickpeas made for a mushy & bland overall taste. I have read great things about this app.  so I was excited to try it  but it just didn't do it for us!   Hubby was getting a little flustered by the end of the meal. It did take our server about 20 mins. to get us our bill...that's a wee bit too long. I understand being busy  but by the time we were done our meal (10PM) a lot of the other diners were already out the door  so come on! After a couple failed times to waive him down  he finally came over on his own  like a waiter should...anyways  we didn't even let him ask ""Any room for Dessert?""...it was simply ""BILL PLEASE""  hahaha!   We actually came back here a few days later for a quickie lunch (ironic   right?) and both ordered sandwiches with fried pickles that were excellent. And  we were out of there in no time!   I would come here again if they could promise us a fountain view  because I think that's worth it myself! Enjoy!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives may not be in the top ten for elegant decor anymore  but it's still worth the trip.  Tables are spaced widely enough you only hear the conversation of your loudest neighbor.  Service is quick and efficient -- maybe a little too much so.  Nice view of the fountains even from inside and the food is great.  We both had the lobster Bolognese  rich  creamy with just a little tomato and a hint of oregano  and plenty of lobster.  One complaint-- no matter what they tell you when you make your reservation you have to be in the restaurant to get on the waiting list for seating on the patio overlooking the fountains.  The wait was 90 minutes when we got there so we reluctantly sat inside on a beautiful  almost tropical October evening.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I went for dinner and sat outside on the patio. Bellagio fountain was on and it was an amazing view!!! Loved the delicious food. Fried zucchini  risotto and the fettuccine was to die for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I waited for a patio seat  so worth it.   He liked his sea bass but I don't think he would get it again. I had the butternut squash pasta  very good but very very rich  I could not finish all of it.  Service was good  view of the fountains at night was excellent!!!  I would go back :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Another restaurant taking part in Restaurant Week 2009 - Todd English's Olives.  On a Saturday afternoon  reservations are a must for locals and visitors alike.  Indoor and outdoor seating are prime  especially if you want to catch the Bellagio fountain show right off the balcony.  We both enjoyed their $20.09 prix fixe lunch menu.  A wonderful bread basket filled with focaccai  bread rolls  and crispbread start your meal  along with olives and tapenade.  Yes  it's really that yummy and good.  (I've been here once before for drinks and all I remember was their bread basket!)  Starters * BBQ Pork Tartlet ""roasted suckling pig  maytag blue cheese  caramelized onions  butter baked puff pastry"" - I'm not big on the puff pastry stuff  but The Husband ordered this and he was quite satisfied with his bits of pork and cheese.  * Watermelon Panzanella ""scarlett & golden watermelon  fresh mint  cracked black olives  feta croutons  togarashi"" - A very refreshing salad  especially with the golden watermelon pieces.  The feta croutons were especially good  although I didn't taste any togarashi in my salad.  Entree  * Chilled Rare Tuna Nicoise ""haricot vert  heirloom tomato  cornichon  smoked hard boiled egg  nicoise olives  champagne vinaigrette"" - Tuna seared perfectly to a beautiful color and the smoked hard boiled egg added a nice taste against the green beans and salad.  * Char Grilled Lamb Chop ""fattoush salad  za'atar spiced pita chips  minted feta  pine nut vinaigrette"" - Two nice sized lamb chops rested on a bed of lettuce.  A hearty but light lunch at the same time.  Dessert  * Seasonal Sorbet Trio ""served with fresh fruit"" - Flavors included mango  blackberry and I think  lemon.  It was refreshing with the added fresh fruit.  A clean dessert.  * Drunk Chocolate Trifle ""dark chocolate puddin'  vanilla bean ice cream  bailey's white chocolate ganache  double chocolate cookie"" - The dark chocolate pudding that laid on the bottom was exceptionally good  similar to the kind you ate as a child but much more upscale.  The ganache and cookie were good too  but I found myself digging for more pudding!    Service was good  our water glasses were refilled on a regular basis (and I love how he covered the glass with a napkin so it doesn't spray everywhere).  They were busy and the staff looked like they were busy too.  Not disappointing at all.  Sidenote: When I called to make reservations  they did tell us to dress more casual upscale.  No athletic wear  nice shorts were okay on  men though  etc.  Not sure how strict they are about that dress code though."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,we came back twice for lunch...does that tell you something?  and both times  the food was exceptional.  the bread basket alone should be against the law.  filled with lavosh and warm rolls  the tapenades are a perfect spread.  the flatbread and the pastas....simply divine.  couldn't order dessert because we were full from lunch...there will be a next time!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food was great  but that bar tender Jon was easy on eyes too. I would mind going back for the view  and I ain't talking about the fountain.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Butternut Squash Sliders A must! Some good flavors  some not so good ex: Ceasar's Salad and tomato Basil mediocre.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'm not sure why vegetarians go nuts for this place Yelp. There is one vegetarian entree  and some salads and sides that accommodate vegetarians. Otherwise  this place is for the seafood/meat lover.  I ordered the butternut squash tortellini. It's a brown buttered  fancy  hand made (looks that way) pasta entree. A few sage leaves were on the plate too. We also tried the mushroom risotto  which was good.  Overall the experience was good  but underwhelming  especially when you're paying 30-40$ for an entree. Probably won't come back here again  The servers were excellent and the ambience was nice  but I'd look elsewhere if you want excellent cuisine.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I made reservations awhile back  specifically requesting a patio seat and realizing we probably wouldn't get it  I was spot on.  Instead  we were crammed in the front of the restaurant.  The restaurant itself was quite dim  but the view out into the shopping area was distractingly bright.  It was awful.  Our table was very oddly configured for 5 people and we physically had to move it in order not to be sharing space with another group.  The hostess was rude.  Onto the food...we had the three course special.  The butternut squash ravioli was amazing.  The sauce complemented it perfectly.  The server had rec'd the steak and I should have heeded his advice even though I am not a huge steak fan.  The paella was horrible.  Completely dreadful.  The mussel shells shattered when you touched them and the meat inside was inedible.  Blech all around.  The chocolate cake was your standard molten chocolate cake that they serve at Chilis.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We snuck away and had lunch here on a Saturday at noon  without needing a reservation. The staff were pleasant and efficient...nothing extraordinary  but nice and capable. We all shared several plates  including the beef carpaccio  the mushroom flatbread and the butternut squash pasta...all three were raved about and devoured!!! Along with the crispy flat bread and the tapenade  a fantastic lunch. We may even sneak back today and repeat with the same choices. ;-)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My dirty martini was excellent and strong (in a good way). You definitely get what you pay for as far as the cocktails go... if I would have had more than two the restaurant might have started spinning. Perfectly ok with that though! The bread basket was decent - I read reviews on here that it's the best thing in the world but to be honest I've had better. I had the restaurant week menu and it was excellent - salad had a huge amount of crab on it  for my main course I got the chicken and it was flavorful and not too heavy  and the mascarpone cheesecake was delicious. $50.12 for 3 courses was an absolute steal with the quality of food I was getting. My dining partner had the short rib lasagna and absolutely raved about it. I had a bite and man oh man was it delicious - huge portion too. All in all it was a nice meal with a great view of the Bellagio fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have been coming to this spectacular place since they opened in the late 90's. Last nights visit was by far the best. We sat on the patio closest to the fountains. I still get giddy when they erupt in dance. Tammie  the wine conisoor  whom we absolutely love  recommended a beautiful Cabernet. We ate our staples. Tuna tar tar  beef carpaccio and the to die for Butternut squash Ravioli! I was in heaven. The service was top notch as well. Thank you Olives for another great visit. See you soon. Patrick and Paul  Kansas City  MO
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Italian restaurant in Bellagio. The outside seating is probably superb  but since it was freezing in December  we opted to eat inside.  Big group of friends went for lunch.For an appetizer  we ordered the short rib and truffle cheese flat bread. Like a thin new york style pizza. VERY good.   Most people ordered the ""Olive's Hamburger"" - heard rave reviews! Surprisingly VERY filling - most of them could not finish the fries  let alone get the hamburger in thier mouths! haha It had to be taken apart to eat! So if you're not in for a messy lunch  skip this! Hamburger ($20 w/truffle cheese. $16 w/o truffle cheese). Some ordered the chicken breast ($20) and was very disappointed. The amount of food  especially compared to the hamburger was about 1/2. It was a single chicken breast on top of a pureed potato? And some veges. The worst part was that the chicken was SUPER dry. I had a bite and did not want any more :( Those that ordered the chicken breast had to steal bread or fries from others! I ordered the special pasta of the day. It was a sword fish and shrimp pasta in red sauce ($23. and WOW. I know i had the best plate in our table. It was delicious. Everything was cooked really well. I can't believe the sword fish was able to retain such moisture! and all the flavors of the dish really complemented each other. I was very pleased.   I was very very pleased with the service and quality of food. Would definately come here again. But probably again for lunch since a quick peak at the dinner menu.. I saw a lot of 40s  50s  and 60s!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was really disappointed in this restaurant. Both from a service and food standpoint. I have been wanting to try this place for several years after seeing it regularly featured in Bon Appetit and other culinary mags. We had the octopus appetizer  which was just okay compared to others we've had. I ordered a mushroom pasta and couldn't believe the kitchen would let that dish go out. The pasta  which is fresh  came out one big gluey mess. When I called down the waiter  he took one look at it and immediately saw the problem. I ended up just sharing my husband's dish  which was the lamb  and that was actually quite good. But I can't get beyond a kitchen of this caliber not recognizing the pasta was inedible. In fact  the waiter came back and said they would not be serving any more pasta dishes that night because something had gone wrong with it. Our server wasn't horrible  but it was clear he was focused on just turning tables and getting people in and out. He also was not that apologetic for the issue and didn't offer anything above and beyond for their misfire except just removing it from the bill.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good food and service but wanted a nice dinner. in a restaurant where I feel like I'm eating with the people next to me we are so close  I didn't enjoy the atmosphere as we couldn't even hear our own conversation. Pretty to see the fountains but if I'm gonna pay that kind of money  I want the matching ambiance not the feeling of being packed in for monetary ends
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sad but true. Olives is not what it used to be. Spent my formative years in Boston and worshiped ( I say WORSHIPED) Mr. English. When he opened in Las Vegas he exalted himself to a new status in my book. LV was at it's turning point and he took a gamble. The gamble was good - a lake side patio spot at the Belagio (now everyone has a lake in Los Vegas  right Mr. Wynn?). I'm afraid the glory days are gone. Olives was Olives when they first opened at the Belag. but  now it's another Hotel Restaurant. Im sure it's no easy task to keep that Charles Hill Ambiance in the desert. Where are all the blue blazers? 
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Restaurant ambiance was great! We went for my husband's birthday with reservations. We were unable to get a table in the outdoor patio but they gave us a table close to the windows. The food was only Ok. Overall  I would return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was pretty excited to have dinner here  after eating at greasy restaurants  for a few day I was excited to eat at a nicer place. We arrived around 5:30pm and was able to score a place on the patio  so we were thrilled. However soon after we were cramped by a family rudely taking photos right next to out table  their arse was even with our table and were hanging onto the back of my  chair to study themselves for the pic... I have to say I was far less than thrilled with the level of common sense of these people. I get its Vegas  but come on  I'm trying to eat and have a nice meal... Not be a prop in your photo op. Really disappointing. Really annoying. Really..........
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have been to Vegas over 25 times. I am very weary of giving this away  because this is the best kept secret in Vegas.   No more than you would pay for any other nice restaurant in Vegas  but the fountain views on the patio are one of the best ambiances to eat dinner in the country.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant was FANTASTIC!  We had Saturday night reservations and were given a table just inside the windows with an excellent view of the Bellagio fountains.  Our waiter was incredibly friendly and attentive.  We loved the tapenade and bread spread that accompanied our cocktails and everyone's food was absolutely delicious (two different pastas  a duck dish  and a fish dish). Everyone ended the meal full and happy-topped off with chocolate cake and coffee.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is top notch - great atmosphere  wait staff and the food is fantastic.  For the price point compared to many other restaurants we ate at last week  this was one of the top places.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Food was good  on par with other restaurants in this price category. Service however was horrible. Waited about 1 hour before appetizers arrived  then another 30 minutes for main course. They tried to 'apologize' by bringing out ""free"" extra sides and appetizers with main course. We were eating late so this was nothing more than them emptying out food they were going to toss. Felt like I was on cruise ship with waiters offering extra entrees. Won't be back."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My husband and I made a reservation for this restaurant through our hotel during our honeymoon (and my first visit) in Vegas as our hotel (the Aria) highly recommended it. We made the reservation at 11 am for 8:45 pm right after our show. We arrived at the restaurant at 8:40 pm (5 minutes early) and were told by the hostess that it would be an hour and a half wait time until we would be seated  even after we told her we had a reservation and she located our table reservation. I guess the restaurant does not understand the concept of reservations enough to have a table at least in the making for guests who make reservations (especially that early in advance!)! We ended up leaving after about 25 minutes and eating at a different restaurant that night and were very disappointed in the experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Salty salty salty. Carpaccio has too much sauce on it. Ordered some pasta and it was drenched with salt.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"WHOA. I was so expecting it to be ""meh."" First  it's located among the shops at the Bellagio. To me this meant it would probably just be overpriced  over done and underwhelming. I was so wrong.  We were escorted to the terrace that offers up a simply breathtaking view of the iconic strip and dancing fountains all to the tune of Frank Sinatra. It was an absolute delight to behold. The faux-Eiffel tower  dazzling city scape  crashing and thundering of the fountains -- wow! I can't imagine that we almost cancelled our ressie earlier in the day.   Gorgeous heavy wrought iron furniture  canopy umbrellas  exquisitely prepared and plated food served by consummate professionals who it seemed had only our absolute perfect experience as their driving force. Every detail was attended to. The wine list and the meal itself would have been enough. The excellent wait staff took it to the next level  and the view knocked it out of the park."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The only thing great about this establishment was the bread and olive tapenade you're served when first seated.  We had to return our lobster mac & cheese because the chef had burnt the cream and the free ranged roasted chicken I ordered was bland and dry.  Won't be going back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I'm sure Yelp will classify this as a ""not recommended"" review because it is less than glowing  but the gnocchi was so overcooked it was closer to a bowl of mashed potatoes than actual gnocchi.  The pesto sauce was flavorless and the service was absent.  Good dessert and nice bread.  Extremely overpriced  even for Las Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Bibbe salad very vinegary  Short rib pasta dish not what I expected.... For a meal that ran us over 1400 dollars I expected much more.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had our anniversary dinner tonight and we had the most amazing time! Not only were we seated in the best spot  the food was excellent (we had the catch of the day and delicious pasta) but the highlight of the evening was our waitresses Jaime who was simply wonderful! Greatest asset for the restaurant!! Thank you for a great night!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Worst service I've had in Vegas. My husband and I are generally easy to please and pleasant guests. We had to ask for everything without any follow up  ie. ""Can I please get another drink?"" The AC was out due to a power outage and I expected and hoped that we would be courteously treated for still choosing to eat at the restaurant.  However  instead the server acted irritated at every request (which were simple  like ""Can we get our check?"" after waiting 2 hours). Totally disappointing and rude.  It must be noted that our busboy  Leo  was amazing and would go get our waiter when he realized we were sitting and waiting for far too long. Horrible. Choose somewhere else."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food is excellent and worth the wait but I still recommend making a reservation.  The restaurant itself is very dark  it's hard to read the menu.  The draw to this place is the Bellagio Fountains.  I would only come back to eat out on the patio watching the fountains during dinner.  It ads something to the experience that you can't get eating inside.  The antipasto salad is excellent!  The artichoke in the salad is cooked perfectly.  The steak is juicy and tender cooked to a perfect medium.  The wait staff is excellent.  They are very professional and knowledgeable about the food and wines.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The Worst. We made a reservation there more than a month ago for our wedding anniversary trip to LV. We arrived at the appointed time and were asked to wait in line for check in. After 15 minutes  we got to the front of the line and were told 'We are running 90 minutes behind schedule.' Excuse me? How does a restaurant run 90 minutes behind schedule at 8:30 at night. You have to be the worst run restaurant around for that to happen. And whose idea was it to ask us to wait in a line for 15 minutes when someone could have told us straight away about the delay. The staff's only response was to say we could come back in an hour to see how things looked.  What's the point of the reservation  Olives??? In the words of Jerry Seinfeld  you know how to TAKE the reservation  you just don't know how to HOLD the reservation.  We'll never go back to a Todd English restaurant anywhere. That was absolutely pathetic treatment of a customer.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English's Olives has a brilliant view of the Bellagio fountains that'll captivate you.  The scallops I had were really great too  not overdone and filling.  The mixed drinks from the bar took a small while to get back to us  and the ice cubes had almost dissolved in our On-The-Rocks drinks.   If we weren't so sated by the carpaccio  we'd have been miffed.   All in all  a reasonably priced experience with a great appetizer of breads and olive spreads  and good follow-through entrees.  We couldn't get a patio seat though  which would have been nice at night.  But it's a busy place with a great view  so try to get one!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just not great.  Much-touted carpaccio was a study in overkill. The beef was great so why smother it with an overpowering mound of blue cheese etc?  Waiter was nice and accomodating  wine recommender (please tell me he wasn't a sommelier)  made pedestrian recommendations of wines that you could get anywhere (in spite of asking for unusual choices).  The process took forever as he was indecisive and did not seem to be particularly adept at zeroing in on taste preferences.  Sea bass was cooked perfectly but oddly fishy  my friend's scallops were overcooked and ho hum.  In an under-served town would get higher ratings; in Las Vegas  not so much.  I would not revisit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was a great meal.  Great drinks  great food  good service  and it looks right over the bellagio fountains!  Really recommend it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my staple on the strip.  Thankfully  there is one in NYC  too.  So  I can eat it back home.    Can you say Carpaccio?  The beef Carpaccio is delicious and void of the normal saltiness of the dish.  The fresh pasta entrees (I had butternut squash ravioli) are all to die for.  If I were to do steak  I might head to one of Vegas's great steakhouses.  But  for New American cuisine that is generous and delicious  Olive's is a hit.    Hopefully the NY one is as good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic Mediterranean gem at the Bellagio. Situated behind Lake Bellagio  the view from window & balcony seats are stunning  especially in the evening. But no worries  even if you're in the dining room you'll still have partial views of the water work.     Once you're seated  your server will most likely greet you right away and tell you a bit the restaurant & menu if it's your first time. (Service at Olive in general is fantastic. I've dined here a handful of times and never once I received anything short of excellent service.) Then it's the complimentary bread basket with three different types of olive tapenade for the table  they're very delicious btw.   A few menu recommendations:  Fig & Prosciutto flatbread - This has to be the best Fig & Prosicutto combo I've ever had. The sweet Fig jam goes perfect with the Gorgonzola cheese. The rosemary crust is a nice touch.  Butternut Squash Tortelli - Very tasty Vegetarian pasta dish. The sauce is a little on the heavy side in my opinion.   Another honorable mention is the Jumbo sea Scallops  served in this sweet & sour glaze on a bed of Arugula salad. However  as delicious as this dish is  I don't recommend if you're hungry or if you're looking to get your money's worth. You get about 6 scallops with this dish and it's $39  Flatbreads  sandwiches & pastas are $14-$22;  main entrees are $26-$60 (steaks are in the $50-$60 ballpark). Cocktails are $12-$18.  Champagnes are $110+ per bottle.  The restaurant itself is trendy but very comfortable; and even though it does have a romantic atmosphere  I wouldn't really recommend it as a date place  as it tend to get very noisy during dinner time. It is however  a great place to dine with family (adults) and friends. I would not recommend this place for children. Reservations recommended.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my all time faves. Elegant but not snooty. I never visit Vegas w/ out adding a trip to Olives to my schedule. Everything I've ever had is scrumptious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was good but not great.  Appetizers were better than the entrees.   If you want steak  get the sirloin.  The Ribeye was fatty and not good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Pound for pound  this is one of the best restaurants in Las Vegas.  Great wine program  and fantastic food.  Don't miss the Steak Tartare appetizer.  Classified as casual at the Bellagio  but you're going to want to spend some dough here.  Ask for patio seating in advance.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good god this is a perfect restaurant. The location  the service  the drinks...   The highlight though is the food. As it should be.  Starters  meals (salmon  raviolis  risotto  cheese And meat board)  and dessert - each done with the highest of quality. Having visited a number of Todd English's restaurants  it is clear that the elevated food and experience can be something to be expected from his sites.   Try the Nectars End and Slingback cocktails for a refreshing but relaxing start to your meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Pros: Excellent food with good portion sizes. Great service - charge cell phones  cameras  etc. at customers' request. Decor is comforting. Very accommodating to large groups.  Cons: N/A
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The views  the wait staff and decor is 1st class!!!  The food however is a grade above.  Everything on the menu is excellent.  Order the beef carpaccio appetizer  it melts in your mouth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went for anniversary with wife. Apps were great...octopus and beef carpaccio...great flavor and great portions. Rest of the meal was bland and lacked punch. It was like all of commonly ordered items...flatbreads  pastas and steaks...were dumbed down for the tourist masses. Not the bold flavors expected of a celebrity chef. Service lacked focus...they were too focused on turning tables and paced the courses accordingly.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food and terrific service. Our waiter was friendly and gave great recommendations on drinks and food. We were both pleased with our entire experience. But the real reason this place deserves five stars is the view. The patio is worth the wait and we were memorized by the water shows. The Bellagio fountains make this restaurant memorable and a must visit next time you're in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Sorry not impressed with my experience  thought everything was overpriced and wait staff kept pushing drinks  apps  expensive wines and really didn't understand how to explain the menu. Ended doing some research online and purchased a Ferrari Corano  Siena 2013 from Senoma at $57. was equal to any wine I've tasted over $100. That was my highlight of the night.  Sorry Tom I will have to put you in the same category as Mr. Colecchio  ""been there done that  never again"""
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Enjoyable trattoria style dining  expert preparation. Overlooking the famous fountains at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was highly recommended by several friends and I left very disappointed! The worst part is the service. I was with a large group so gratuity was already included with our meal. Our server was not attentive at all. Took forever to come and take our drink and food orders and he was incredibly rude! He made it seem like it was a bother when asked for recommendations or any questions for that matter. He was actually very passive aggressive. It was almost like he didn't care about how he served us since he knew he was already getting a good tip. We complained to a manager and he didn't seem to care either. The food itself was very disappointing. But to be honest I can't even remember clearly because I was too upset about the server to even enjoy my meal. I'm giving two stars because the view is amazing and I would only give this place another chance if I were to go with a smaller party.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent service  comfortable atmosphere and remarkable food. The bread basket before the meal was a good indication that a memorable meal was to come. We stared with a fig and prosciutto pizza and beef tartar. The beed tartar was phenomenal  a very refreshing taste. For dinner  the Alaskan salmon was an excellent choice. On a bed of risotto  the salmon was lightly crisped and absolutely mouth watering. For dessert  I ordered the cookie platter and the chocolate falling cake. The falling cake tasted sort of like play dough  but the cookie platter made up for it. A snickerdoodle  white chocolate macadamia  chocolate chip  oatmeal raisin all served warm with fresh  homemade vanilla ice cream. I'd recommend this place to Anyone.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good food here. Tried many dishes so I do not remember them all  but the beef carpaccio is the best I have ever had so far...could taste the quality in the meat because it was so fresh. Also had the tuna carpaccio which was good as well  but beef was still the best. Went with scallops for the main course which our server highly recommended  and was glad I did. I'm a fan of scallops and it did not disappoint  the portion was good as well. The truffle fries were also very good that even though I was pretty full  I just couldn't help picking at it.   Will definitely return to Olives the next time I'm in Vegas and order the beef carpaccio and truffle fries again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The BEST * Carpaccio* plate EVER-ever-ever!!! hands-down!! ....  ( I looooooove carpaccio )  ...and its a ginormous heaping plate of Carpaccio you could ever want and then some. Cause you have all this carpaccio slices covering an entire plate not to mention its also burying a pile of salad  and then  underneath the salad is a piece of bread that is soaked in some marinade  just in case the carpaccio and salad wasn't enough to fill you up. The veal pasta is amazing too. The meat and the sauce is slow cooked into a reduction and then served on a linguini type of pasta. I've ordered this way to many times and its not on the menu.   The menu changes upon seasons but if there is a plate or plates that you just specifically love and you have trouble finding it on the menu  you can actually make a request to the chef  and he will make it for you. =)   I loove it!  Big toast to olives and my husband and I's regular waiters.  p.s. Excellent Service but make reservations. This place is outrageously busy and you must rsvp a day or two and sometimes  a week in advance to reserve a spot.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really enjoyed my experience here. We were able to sit on the patio  which really enhanced the experience. There are gorgeous fountains that go off every half hour or so to music. The patio is situated facing the strip  so you have a great view and can help spark conversation.   Our service was excellent. They have ipads for the menu  which is awesome when it comes to choosing a wine. They have a very extensive choice of amazing wines. I chose a white wine with our spicy Chicken flatbread. The flatbread was very good  which is to be expected at a nice restaurant on the strip! They also offer Bread with olives and olive oil for a little something to snack on. I really enjoyed the olives; considering the name of the restaurant  it was very fitting.   Lastly  I got the cocoa pot for dessert. That was an incredibly decadent dessert and I highly recommend it. Only thing I would say is that it's slightly on the heavy side  which only matters because the temp in NV is usually in the upper 100's and makes you feel slightly sick afterwards.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"1st impression - ""wow this place really smells like olives"" LIKE ACTUALLY.  Do they spray olive perfume or are they just making THAT much tapenade ?  Its bizarre - and you just really gotta go in there or just pass by it to get what I'm talking about.  The service was amazing -- our waiter (forgot his name!) was delightful.  He kept opening the door for us whenever we wanted to sneak outside to see the fountains.   Beef carpaccio -- HUGE portion.  I thought it was delicious at the time  but an hour or so after dinner we both didn't feel that great.  TMI -- Burps and/or other bodily functions were not so pretty.  We didn't get ILL  no throwing up but felt very off for the rest of the night and the next morning.   We also shared the seared scallops which was great.    Would I come back here again?  No."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went in before a show. They got us out in 40 minutes yet the quality did not lack The gnocchi was delicious and I am not a pesto fan  The zucchini I couldn't stop eating even tho I was super full My husband loved the scallops and said they were the best he ever had. The mushroom risotto was divine  The service was quick and friendly
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Another Vegas establishment recommended by Liza L. She said it was a little pricey but worth the try! It was also recommended by other Hawaii food bloggers. Located in the Bellagio  the restaurant had a very old American type of vibe (tho conversely  Yelp says the food is new American). It's another one of Todd English's many restaurants. Who the heck is Todd English? I had no clue so I had to look him up. Wikipedia says he's a celebrity chef based out of Boston. His food is American with a rustic Italian focus. His original restaurant in Boston  also called Olives (named after his wife)  closed down because of a fire.  Anyhoo  the food.  We were seated pretty quickly for our lunch visit. The waiter offered a complimentary basket of lavosh  ciabatta bread and facoccia  along with some olives and tepenade. Very delicious and quite filling. The menu featured various pasta dishes  flat breads  salads and protein. For our starter  we had the flat bread special of the day which was topped with ham  asparagus  caramelized onions and parmesan. Yum.  I ordered the sirloin steak sandwich which came with a side balsamic spinach salad and garlic fries. The steak was cooked perfectly. I had too much bread earlier so I ended up eating just the steak. The garlic fries...well  not that great. I guess I was expecting something more gourmet. My sister had a burger topped with caramelized onions. It was so good I put some of it on my sandwich. Supposedly they have some great desserts here but we carbo-loaded enough for one meal.  The wait staff were very friendly and attentive. Definitely not  pretentious as I would have expected of a restaurant at the Bellagio.  The entire meal total came out to under $70. Yes  pricey  but the quality of the food (minus the fries) and experience made it worthwhile.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Looking for a romantic fine dining experience? Check out Olives and ask for a patio seat where you can feast while watching fountain shows in front of the Bellagio.  Outdoor seating is limited  so making a 5pm reservation and arriving a few minutes early is your best bet to secure a table.   The menu was relatively small  but full of luxurious options. We ordered the charcuterie plate as an appetizer to our scallop risotto and seafood risotto entrees.  While waiting for the appetizer  we were served two different olive spreads with a crunchy crisp and soft focaccia bread.  This was a nice twist to the traditional balsamic and olive oil dip that is usually served in a nice restaurant. Both breads were tasty  but the crunchy crisp stood out with a more complex flavor profile.   For drink  my significant other ordered a Chardonnay from Napa and a Pinot from Russian River Valley. I felt like spirits and tried the rosemary infused manhattan.  The Chardonnay was great and the Pinot was good...but had a bit of a bite and wasn't as full flavored as the Russian River Valley pinots I am used to. The manhattan was tasty without the rosemary infusion being too overpowering.   Our entrees arrived promptly and tasted spectacular. Every few bites we looked up at each other and said  ""mmm....this is good"".  I'm sure I could come up with a slew of adjectives to describe my buttery soft scallops with savory rich risotto and my significant others chorizo spiced broth seafood risotto  but I find the simplistic grunts and nods of satisfaction tend to represent the highest compliment we can provide. When eating food this good  we tend to be too busy enjoying the meal to spark up much conversation or debate highly descriptive prose beyond basic descriptions of complete satisfaction.   For desert  we shared the creme brulee and chocolate peanut butter lava cake. I'm a total chocoholic  but I think the creme brulee came out the winner. The lava cake was also quite good with the peanut butter adding an additional layer of richness to an already luxurious chocolate explosion.   During our meal  we enjoyed 3 different fountain shows and plenty of people watching from the view. I'm sure dining inside is just as tasty  but how many restaurants can you dine at and enjoy multiple over-the-top water shows that shoot several stories into the air?    Overall  a great meal and memorable experience that we will remember and recommend to our friends for years to come."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We would have given this place 4 stars but right off the bat we wanted to order a bottle of wine from the sommelier's select list and asked the bartender a question about it.  He looked at us like we had just stepped off a spaceship.  WTF!!!  He had no clue about a wine that his sommelier was supposedly featuring???  You would think he would have at least tasted it at some time...   We just wanted a light lunch after a big breakfast at the Hash House A Go Go so ordered the bottle of wine and the Charcuterie board. Charcuterie board along with  complimentary  bread and tapenade made for a perfect light lunch. Will try again sometime for dinner.  Food quality was very good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have been here three times and the experience has always been good. The restaurant is not large  I would recommend reservations vs walking up. The plates I've ordered have been superb with no issues. The bread they serve that is complimentary isn't always fresh  that would be the one thing I would change. Service was great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First time to a Todd English restaurant so I had to order the dishes that everyone talks about and according to our server  these are the dishes that made Todd English famous.  Grilled squid and octopus ($15) - AWESOME! Fig and prosciutto flatbread ($18) - GREAT! Butternut squash tortelli ($17) - It's too sweet for a savory dish. The filling reminded me of pumpkin pie filling. Not so great.  Our server recommend the banana tiramisu for dessert. It was nothing special.   Pineapple iced tea ($6) and two pears cocktail ($14)  both were awesome! The complimentary bread basket was nice  3 kinds of bread  2 tapenades and olives.  Service was good. We asked for a table with a view. We were about two tables away from the window. Not what I would call a view. Next time I would ask to sit outside.  2 great dishes out of 4. I would say it was a good meal  not great. 4 stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good food  nice atmosphere  not too pricey  good service.  The restaurant is always packed due to its location inside the Bellagio so you might want to make a reservation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Disappointing.  Don't waste your money here. It is nothing like the Olives in Boston. This is a pretty tacky place.  Poorly trained servers and cooks. The pork chop was so overcooked it was dry. I told the waitress and she had it redone. And guess what it was partially completely uncooked. definitely the two worse versions of pork chops I have ever been served ----and at the same restaurant.  The busboy was one of the least professional busboys I have ever encountered.  He would reach in front of you with a big water pitcher and almost clobber you with his arm whenever he serviced the table. It didn't help that we had to hear him sing to himself either. The restaurant obviously suffers from poorly trained staff  no quality control and a lack of good management.  Plenty of better places to spend $200.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I would go there just for the beef capriccio. There plates are huge! so you definitely can share. the flatbread pizza it was just okay and the roast beef sandwich was about the same. waiter was slow to take our order multiply times. But if you like capriccio go there.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,3.5 stars excellent service  some delicious food (the yummy breakbasket  swordfish special and butternut squash tortelli)  some decent food (the sirloin and the mahi mahi)  nice ambiance.    it's annoying you have to walk out of the restaurant to use the bathroom.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I always enjoy eating at Olives when I visit Vegas and the Bellagio.  It never disappoints.  For the first time  I tried the octopus appetizer and I was surprised at how uniquely it was prepared and paired with squid.  It was very tender and juicy. The full tentacle was fun to eat!!! I also had the prosciutto and fig flatbread which was a sweet and savory delight. It's a lovely restaurant with the best view of the Bellagio fountains and the Paris Eiffel Tower. Sit out on the patio and relax with a cappuccino  dessert or cocktail.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had the most amazing experience here and dinner service. The guys I came with one used to work there (Raul) so of course everyone was very friendly and came to say hello to us. They made me feel so welcomed. We sat outside on the patio and Jamie took care of us. She is great! I lover her personality. We were also celebrating a special occasion and they surprised us with a beautifully decorated plate and some desserts. I had the special fettuccine pasta   I substituted the clams for chicken because I'm allergic to shell fish  they were very accommodating to that  where some restaurants would say no. I will definitely come back to try the yummy cocktails and wine list !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The highlight of this restaurant is the complimentary bread basket and the olives/tapenade spread. The place is quite loud (hard to hear the people who are sitting across from you) and very crowded (make a reservation ahead of time). The food was just okay for price. Not great  but certainly delicious. The waitstaff were all very friendly and nice (diligent about refilling waters and iced teas).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I stayed at Bellagio so I thought what better way than to pick a restaurant inside the hotel. We got seated within 5 minutes of arriving  no reservation made  didn't mind about not having the outside seating.   Our server was attentive and helpful in finding what I wanted. I got the Agnolotti  which was by far the best pasta I've ever had in my life. Very  very tasteful and rich in flavour. The starters were also very tasty. The olives and olive spread with the garlic bread were nice to have while we waited for our food.   Would definitely recommend this place and the agnolotti if you're looking for a delicious pasta dish.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It is definitely one of my favorites in Las Vegas.  The hubs and I have been there several times and have yet to be disappointed. I love the decor  and the service has always been wonderful.  The food is also excellent - the flatbreads are very good.  The desserts are fabulous!  If you can  sit outside and take in the Bellagio Fountains. It is absolutely stunning after dusk!  On our first visit  it took longer than expected for us to get seated since we were waiting for the patio.  The manager  who thought we were waiting just a bit too long  gave us some bubbly on the house.  That impressed us immensely!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I wasn't very hungry so had the beef carpaccio. My god what a mess!  Unfortunately the chef has taken a classic  simple  delicious Italian staple and tried to turn it into a Vegas extravaganza but got 'un disastro' by covering great quality beef with a slime of sauces.  Underneath this Pollockesque creation lies a few greens on a cube of fried polenta. Oh it pretends to be Italian so lets chuck a bit of polenta in somewhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives is one my ""must go"" restaurants in Las Vegas.  The staff is friendly. The restaurant is immaculate and buzzing with activity.  The salads are fresh and the fish is tasty.  Pastas are delicious but a the sauce is a little too heavy for my likings.  Olives is pricy even for Vegas standards.  But is worth the treat"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I went there recently on a trip to Las Vegas. They do have a fun drink menu. They have  variety of breads which were all delicious. The salad was yummy and the food was good.  I did feel like everything took way too long.  Maybe that's just the Way they do things in Las Vegas  but I typically don't enjoy spending three hours at one meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,***Todd English's Olives is a reasonably priced and good option for a nice lunch in Las Vegas  but dinner here is  unfortunately  similar to many other restaurants in Las Vegas--expensive with just okay food at best***  I enjoyed my first trip to Todd English's Olives for lunch.  The view was great though you may have to deal with cigarette smoking on the patio and the food was both good and reasonably priced (nice housemade pastas and good scallops).  Dinner at Olives did not offer the same experience.  The dining room was pretty dark and the food was very overpriced like other Las Vegas restaurants backed by well known chefs.  The dinner menu at Olives did have similarities to Olives' lunch offerings.  There was a good mix of starters and housemade pastas (though the housemade pastas on my last trip were more my style).  For dinner  Olives nixes the lunchtime sandwiches for more substantial entrees.  Dinner started the same as lunch--breads with olives and a variety of olive spreads.  I started with the seared foie gras  which was served on buttered brioche and garnished with spice poached pears  honeyed yogurt and crushed walnuts.  It was a mostly sweet plate especially given that the portion of foie gras was so small.  I really enjoyed the spice poached pears--nice caramelization and sweetness.  The foie gras was good and creamy  but it was just too small of a portion.  For my entree  I had the seared scallops  which were served on truffled yukon mashed potatoes and topped with sauteed sea beans and a Cabernet reduction.  The scallops themselves were a very good quality--fresh  moist and soft.  Unfortunately  they were also quite salty.  The sides were okay but nothing special.  For dessert  I had their chocolate molten cake  which was not the most original dessert  but it was still a very good dessert.  The cake had a good outside crust while the center was hot  rich  chocolaty  and gooey.  The cake and the warm  gooey center went very well with the okay but not great ice cream.  Service was just okay.  It took a while to put in our order and while our server seemed pleasant  she also seemed a little distracted.  As mentioned  dinner prices are high here.  The prices are consistent with similar quality restaurants in Las Vegas  but the entree prices here would be very overpriced in Los Angeles  San Francisco and Chicago.  Olives' food is at the very least okay  which is actually better than a lot of Vegas restaurants.  Still  the food is not that remarkable and it comes at a very high price at dinner.  Olives is not a bad option for lunch where prices are lower and the atmosphere is nicer  but you might want to seek another option for an upscale dinner in Las Vegas.  Olives is located in Bellagio.  Like almost all of the major hotels and casinos on The Strip  Bellagio offers complimentary valet and self parking.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Honestly  service is better than the food. Balsamic reduction should be sparingly on the carpaccio  and our fish pasta special was lackluster with a sauce too flavorless.  Thank goodness the sommelier  the waiter  and his assistant made my fiance's birthday better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Most memorable lunch in Vegas so far !!! Went here for lunch on 12/17/11.. We stayed at the Bellagio and I have to say that all of their restaurants are 5 stars. Todays the weather was spectacular... Sunny  cool in the 60's  blue sky  crisp delicious weather to be outside enjoying the beautiful view of the Vegas strip  Eiffel tower  the Bellagio Lake and its fountains..and that's where we sat. Todd's Olives offers a prefix menu which sounded like a great deal however my husband and I are foodies. We can't  be constricted to a set menu..  The cocktails are impressive  we both had Bellinis wich are prepared with peach puree  Heavenly!  For food we ordered the prosciutto and figs flat bread and the grilled octopus with garbanzo ..this dish is an authentic spanish garbanzo soup with the most tender grilled Octopus  The flat bread is amazing   is made with gorgonzola cheese  bountiful slices of prosciutto   fresh figs grilled  arugula and a drizzle of truffle oil..wow nee I say more?  for main course the chicken and vegetable lasagna and I had the duck confit agnolotti..all I can say is that these dishes were so good that we wiped the plates clean. Unfortunately leaving no room for dessert..  We HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.. and will come back everytime we are in Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was our second time at the restaurant. If you have time  make a reservation and get on the wait list upon arrival for the patio seat- beautiful fountains will entertain you while you dine! Service was wonderful  great wine list  foie grais was absolutely delicious!!! Last time we had scallops and steak for main courses and those tasted delicious from what I can remember. Had Chilean Sea Bass this time- save $$  don't order  I've had it better in every other place I ever ate sea bass at..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Delicious dinner  but extremely noisy( couldn't converse with my friend) and sat us at a table at the end of the bar.( with reservations) major runway for the waiters. I would not return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for my birthday  and made a 5:15pm reservation.  Upon arrival  there was no patio seating available  which immediately put a damper on my birthday dinner. Wife was not happy  and the hostess told us that we could still step outside to take pictures. Well  we couldn't even do that because of how close the tables are to each other outside. So we ended up sitting where the hostess said its a nice table by the window. Failed on that as well  it was along the wall between the windows  and could barely look out. Oh well...have to make the best of it. Wife had the 2 Pear Martini which was excellent  and I had an old fashioned. We had the Octopus and squid appetizer. 5 Stars. Wife had the prawn special with rissoto  delish!  I had the chicken entree  looked great  a bit on the dry side  but still tasty. Dessert was a special cream puff dessert that said happy birthday  great touch!  and even ordered the banana tiramisu  to die for. Our waitress  I think was french  was awesome. She was so attentive and friendly. She hit every step of fine dining service at our table  and actually made my wife happy. I thank her for exceeding and making our expecations memorable  regardless of the table view situation with the hostess's.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Horrible food and gruff  awful service! With all the fabulous  high end dining in Vegas this one sorely disappoints! Stay away from the Vegas outpost and stick with NYC's Olives which is still quite good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just enjoyed the fig  prosciutto and goat cheese flat bread (pizza) and caprese salad for lunch this past weekend - terrific! I've been to Vegas tons of times and have never been successful at getting a seat at Olives - this last time we lucked out with a couple of seats at the bar  but they are generally always busy: reservations are recommended! Prices for lunch seemed reasonable (considering)  and service was quite good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had the shrimp stuffed crab. Truffle fries good. Sorbet was great. Service was great.  Was going to sit outside  but it was to hot.  Otherwise good !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had high hopes for my return visit to Olives. Several years ago I had a lovely meal at the restaurant while staying at the Bellagio  but was disappointed with my most recent dinner.   Service was both rushed and inattentive  with a sense of urgency to turn the tables coupled with an attitude that more than suggested ""Why bother  we'll never see these people again."" Staff wanted to take our meal order even before presenting the menu.  The foie gras served with my meal was delicate and properly seared. I wish I could say the same for the filet  which - ordered rare - was served over-cooked  dry  and completely unseasoned. Staff were nowhere to be found after dropping off the dishes  so there was no one to run interference with the kitchen.  Todd English  your staff at this outpost can and should do better with both service and cuisine. The Bellagio Hotel & Resort positions itself as a 5 star establishment and purports to have restaurants of the same caliber. Sadly  this spot is letting them down."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Bad food. Bad service. I'm surprised based on all the good reviews. Don't order the chicken Parmesan. Left hungry.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,From the bread to the entrees  the food was bland and expensive...I got lobster fettuccine and feel like I've been pickpocketed ...it was  like  oily boxed noodles with no flavor. Everyone at my table was disappointed with their food...how on earth is this place still happening?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We love Vegas a little TOO much  and my passion is finding great food  great service  and a great ambiance---for a solid price.  Todd English's Olives has quickly become a ""must visit"" spot for every trip. If you want to spare no expense  you can definitely find this at TEO (their top wine is around 55k. Yep  55k.) But  if you're like us  and just looking to get a stellar  absolutely memorable food experience with superlative service  and a gorgeous ambiance  then you can also find this here. For around $20  you can share their beef carpaccio  which is a little piece of heaven.   I cook  a lot  and it kills me to pay a high mark-up for food that really isn't that tough/expensive to make. Their carpaccio  to me  is one of the all-time best values on the strip. You get amazing meat  shaved cheese (parmesean?)  two sauces drizzled on top  two types of tapenades  a very generous bread basket with an assortment of lavosh and traditional breads  all artfully prepared on a polenta and field greens' base. It's a romantic  decadent dish you can share  for a stellar price. Top it off with a couple of nice glasses of wine or mixed drinks  and it's a truly memorable experience.  Their service is also superlative. Curtis  one of their master bartenders  as a huge part of what makes Olives amazing for us. He is warm  polished  incredible at what he does  and our talks with him are always one of our favorite parts of the trip.  Whether it is for appetizers and drinks  or a full-out meal (everything we saw come out looked amazing)  Olives will now be a cornerstone of all of our trips  and make sure to say ""hi"" to Curtis if you see him...he's always the cherry on top of an amazing experience for us!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My bf had Veal & Fontina Fazzoletti.... But I enjoyed my dish better ... Short rib Pappardelle ...  Would not mind going back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It came HIGHLY recommended  really looking forward to it - and then  what a huge let down. We were two women alone and they put us  in a corner  which was okay- waiter was nice. Had the carpaccio which I was told to order and I loved it  my friend had the mushroom flatbread and that was really good as well. The bread  which we had to ask for  was nothing special. Then the entrees - ohmigod!!!! - I had the Mahi Mahi and she had the almond crusted swordfish. Both were seriously overcooked to the point of tastelessness - the swordfish had a non-swordfish like texture and the Mahi Mahi was so tasteless and dry that I didn't bother to eat it at all  and I like to eat. The little shrimp around the fish were excellent  there were about three of them and thank god they were there.   It wouldn't have been so dispiriting if these dishes weren't so bloody expensive - like $38 and $42 apiece.   Neither of us had ever left so much food on our plates before. We just told the waiter we were really full from the apps.    It was depressing since there are so many great choices in Las Vegas and this is where we went.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,AMAZING!!  We eat here every time we go to Vegas and every time it is AMAZING.  The portions are substantial and the prices are reasonable.  The ambiance is fabulous and beautifully decorated.  Our service is always excellent.  I ordered a caesar salad which was wonderful and then had the gnocchi. I at ate every little bit!!  This place has to be the best dinner on the strip.  LOVE IT!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,As you walk down the hall you can smell this place from a mile away. I have yet to have a bad meal there! I would totally suggest trying to get a seat on the patio overlooking the fountains. Great meal and a great view... it would be a great spot to propose... just saying
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,New Years Day lunch on the terrace overlooking Lake Bellagio and its spectacular fountains is hard to improve upon....unless you happen to be dining at Olives!  We had lunch New Years Day and it was one of the best quality  well prepared  well served meals I have ever had in Vegas.  And  frankly  without all the Vegas glitz.    I highly recommend their bellini.  It is as good as it gets outside Harry's Bar in Venice  Italy.  Ask the server about their specials.  I had a crab crusted Chilean Sea Bass special that was the best sea bass I've ever eaten.  There is something for everyone.  Fish lover  carnivore or vegetarian.  Everything we tried was perfectly prepared.  The ambiance inside and outside is elegant without all the Vegas fan fare and the service is comparable to a New York City 4 star restaurant.  Bravo! Will definitely be returning.....and definitely partaking in the Chocolate Fallen Cake for dessert again.  Wow!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my first time at Olives and it did  not dissapoint after all the glowing reviews I heard about this place.  I ordered the Fig and Prosciutto Flatbread...BRILLIANT!  One of my companions ordered the seared scallops and spinach salad...another hit.   I highly recommend Olives to anyone  it is well worth the wait.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was *so* overpriced for the quality of the food! I had the Boston Bibb salad  and it seriously tasted like it had been sitting in its dressing for hours; it wasn't remotely crisp or crunchy like fresh leafy greens should be. I also had the lobster fettuccine  which at $42  should have been much better than it was. The lobster wasn't light  tender and fresh; it was heavy and a little greasy  again  like it had been sitting around in its sauce for too long. The cream sauce was OK  but was too thick and heavy to complement what should have been light  tender  airy lobster. Overall  any high points were completely unmemorable because of the lack of freshness that haunted every dish and flavor. Our group of four spent $400+  and I would say that this place just barely grazes up against the bottom rung of mediocre. What a ripoff. I would not recommend this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to the restaurant for lunch with our little kids (baby and a toddler). Even thou the restaurant is kind of upscale the atmosphere was very chill and relaxing. We got a nice booth with a view of the famous fountains so kids we super happy when the show started. Service was impeccable and food was so delicious. We had couple of flat breads including the one with the goat and several appetizers - the shrimp with crab was absolutely amazing!!!!!! Such awesome flavors!! We will go there again when to come to LV!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When I was asked to book dinner for my work team while in town for a conference I panicked and chose a Olives based on reviews. Vegas has so much good food (and in a food scientist so I take a lot of food all day)  but I'm telling you now-- you will not be disappointed here! The service was phenomenal. The flavors were powerful and the temperatures and textures were perfect.   The menu isn't too exotic so you can bring picky eaters (they chose the roasted chicken) but it also has options for those who like to try new flavor combos.  We went to a lot of very nice restaurants  but this was by far my favorite this time around. Atmosphere is cozy for a romantic night with your lady  but is also sleek enough for a business group. It's not cheap though so just keep that in mind...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I will try to be polite in my review  I know I sound a bit snobbishn but when I pay almost $150 with tip for lunch I expect to get value for the price   This is the third time I eat here  Last time was two years ago and it was great   But this time it was just bad! My wife and I had lunch there on my birthday April first    The only bright spot in all the meal was the service  the waiters are very nice and gave us a good feeling   But the star of the event  the food was really bad.  Before I get to the food the restaurant and the furniture felt they needed an urgent update  the restaurant felt used and worn.  When we sat down to the table  we received A Bread basket with two kinds of tapenade and olives that were really salty    For starters we ordered the fig and prosciutto flatbread  And the tuna carpaccio   Two dishes I've eaten in the past and I really enjoyed - Big disappointed this time.  It took a long time to get the food  more than half an hour  Even tough the restaurant was half empty.  Last time the flat bread also had caramelized shallots and a touch of rosemary. The combination of sweet figs with prosciutto and caramelized onions and a touch of rosemary was a wonderful combination. But this time  the bread was flooded with sweet fig jam with no trace of onion and rosemary  so sweet on the border of inedible.  The tuna carpaccio had the same illness  poor performance. In the past it was a wonderful dish. Fresh tuna  light mashed potatoes made with olive oil  crunchy cracker and capers. This time we got tasteless tuna and a lump of bland mashed potatoes. Really not tasty.  As main courses I ordered the scallops on carrot risotto   My wife ordered one of the Day Specials  the New York Strip with Shiitake Mushrooms glaze with mashed potatoes and green beans.  I do not know where to start but the dishes were bad.  I received my three scallops sitting in a risotto.  The scallops were fine  but the risotto was bad. Instead of getting a rich and sticky creamy rice with some bite in the middle  I got tasteless overcooked rice sitting in a pool of water with a trace of orange color.  I ordered this dish because I saw Todd English cooking this dish In one of the  morning shows  when he cooked it at looked really good. The risotto looked rich with a fluorescent orange color. The dish looked really really good  nothing resembling the dish I got.  All I have to say about my wife's dish there is no connection between the steak she received and a New York Strip steak. Does not look like  much less taste like a new York strip steak. The dish was filled with a really  strong shiitake mushrooms sauce   a trick used to hide poor quality meat it is not something I was expecting to get in this restaurant   A $12 Steak at longhorn steakhouse is much much better than this steak.  I'm sorry if I sound critical it is my opinion  It was my wife's first time in this restaurant and she was really disappointed    In a city like Las Vegas there are endless options for restaurants for this price.  I ate in countless restaurants in the Las Vegas when I lived here  And I was never disappointed like this.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was our third time to dine here  and our least favorite of the three. My wife said her pork chop was over cooked and barely edible. I decided on the Portobello Flat Bread and Cajun Shrimp Mac n cheese. The Flat Bread was outstanding  but the mac n cheese was very disappointing. Olives has a great atmosphere  they just need better consistency regarding their food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice location and atmosphere. The waitstaff was excellent. However  my husband and I were not impressed with our food. Just our opinion.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a wonderful experience we had celebrating a special birthday with special friends! We all ordered the pre-theater dinner with a choice of appetizer  entree  and dessert for $55/person and it was fantastic. We ordered beef tartare  Bibb lettuce salad  pork chop  scallops  chocolate peanut butter cake and sorbet. Everything was delicious and portions were very good. We thought the value was excellent. But more important  the service was amazing! Our server  Michelle M  had to deal with an egg allergy with our friend and she went above and beyond to ensure he would be safe and also highly satisfied with his meal. I'm sure she's waited on some celebrities and high rollers but she treated us like special guests and we felt well taken care of. Thank you  Michelle and Olives!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The negative: I made a reservation weeks in advance and asked to be seated by the Fountains. Apparently  they don't take reservations for that even though they give you a box on their online reservation form for requests. Go figure! When we were shown to our seat the hostess was very rude when I asked if there was something by the fountains. I didn't like the setup of the tables inside. We had a table along the wall that had the bench seat on one side and chairs on the other. The bench cushions sunk in  which made eating sort of difficult and the table next to us was pretty close. I think that makes for a somewhat uncomfortable dinning experience.   The positive: The food is wonderful! My steak was cooked to perfection. The wine list was great. The service was good too. Nelson  our server  was on top of everything. I always like a restaurant that keeps my water glass full and fresh.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had been here once before for lunch and really liked it.  So  we went back for dinner when we were recently in Vegas. Wow it was bad. If I could  this would get 0 stars.  I mean really bad.  I have never been to a restaurant before where no one liked anything.  We started off with salad  a flat bread  and a carpacio.  The carpaccio was OK and big  thank goodness bc that was all that I liked. My husband never leaves pizza  and there was half a flat bread left. It was a weird combo of flavors and really dry.  For dinner  husband had scallops  I had ravioli  and our friend had some pasta.  All terrible.  I couldn't eat the center of the ravioli -- it was sickeningly sweet  so I cut around them and ate a little of the pasta. (It was butternut squash -- one of my favorites  so it isn't like I am not used to the flavor.) The scallops were disgusting -- they had a toothpaste gritty texture and a really  really fishy flavor.  Friend's pasta -- also bad  he barely touched it. We were glad they left us the bread because we tried to fill up on that.  Terrible experience.  Oh  and no one even asked why we ate nothing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We were able to get a quick reservation the day of and also requested to be seated outside and we were able to  which was awesome. If you eat here definitely sit on the patio so you can see the fountains. It is an amazing view and a great experience! The service was alright  not great. The food was pretty good and the prices aren't that bad!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One word... Yum!!  We went based on a recommendation from a friend.  We showed up at 5:45 to wait for a patio table  again as recommended.  Have to say our friends have very good taste!   The ambience of the patio is just amazing. You are sitting so close to the Bellagio water show that you can feel a slight mist hitting your face.  Lovely!   The food is superb. We started with beef carpaccio which was a party in my mouth.  For my main entree I ordered the monk fish special.  It was so yummy.  My hubby and I have vowed never to go to Vegas again without making Olives a priority.  Well worth the money.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The boyfriend made reservations at Olives due to a rave review from one of his friends. Well we werent disappointed. The lighting was dim  perfect for the evening we intended on having. The food was decadent and oh so flavorful. We started with the soft shell crab salad and the eggplant raviolis ( A+ and A+)  the bread assortment was great  our meals were melt in your mouth. The encrusted salmon and his short rib were simply delicious. A little on the pricey side but oh so worth it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wonderful lunch overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  Bread and olive plate they start the meal with was great.  Don't miss the fig  prosciutto  and Gorgonzola pizza...one of their signature items!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my favorite restaurant in Vegas (I was there for five days and ate out for lunch and dinner every day).   We started with the flatbread--the HouseFarm? one (with asparagus).  It was solid and had a nice texture.  I preferred the taste of the foccacia bread that came at the start of the meal but this was a good choice for an app and was a good choice to split among three people. For my entree  I had the mushroom papperdelle.  It was really good.  The description is right on except for the lack of mushrooms in the dish.  There were actually very few mushrooms in the dish but it was still good.  Nothing amazing or different but a very good dish. The drinks were good (strong).  My friends loved their drink called the Slingback--very delicious and sweet.  I had a martini which was good. Service was amazing.  Like most places  they make you wait no matter what even if you have a reservation but they seated us quickly.   This is the ONLY place I went to this trip that I would return to on my next trip.  I have no idea why the reviews are not averaging higher especially compared to the places that were five stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent view  very good food  pricey  service very good and very nice atmosphere.  Servers look a little stressed and very busy. Don't know why so I won't speculate.  I'm happy my 2 boys got to see a classy wedding proposal. I actually caught it all on video. I hope they learned something from the young man. Great planning on his part and they looked like very nice genuine people.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"It's just overpriced Italian food  I've been duped!! No  not really .... but that's what my tired  semi jet-lagged brain was thinking at the time.  In reality this place isn't so bad  I'd go as far as saying i enjoyed myself. After a 30 minute wait we were seated. The atmosphere was a bit more intimate and up scale.  The pace sits on the Bellagio Fountains. If it's important to you  ask for a seat with a good view of the fountain because not many of them have it.   Everything was overpriced  but hey  you are in one of the most popular hotel's in Vegas.  The bread came out with some sort of olive pure dip or whatever  i'm mentioning it because it was memorable and delicious.  I had a glass of wine and a $34 bowl of mushroom Pasta. It was really a nice tasting dish  one thing that stuck out was the actual flavor of the pasta itself. It (the pasta) tasted homemade and stood out even among the sauce and other items.   I'll file this in the ""I'd rate this higher if someone else paid"" category.   Was here on 10/02/2014"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I really don't get all the great reviews this place had received...  1) Good luck getting in if you don't have a reservation.  2) Greek salad was good  pretty hard to ruin a Greek salad.  3) Gnocchi with shredded chicken - not good at all  was more like a soup  too much liquid. gnocchi were pasty...  4) Roasted Free Range Chicken - not good at all. Dry  flavorless  chicken  potato cake that it was served on was mushy  garlic green beans were too salty.  Real disappointment for what is touted to be a mid / high end Las Vegas restaurant.  Better off going elsewhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came for lunch and since it was a beautiful day  we decided to sit outdoors next to the Bellagio fountains.  The bread basket included an assortment of breads but my favorite was the onion focaccia.  We ordered fig & prosciutto flat bread  crab stuffed jumbo prawns  brick oven roasted free range chicken  and chicken and gnocchi.    The oven roasted chicken was just that  roasted chicken.  The flatbread can be a meal by itself.  It had big chunks of figs  almost too big.  I would have liked thinly sliced figs.  Overall it was very good.  Chicken and gnocchi and the crab stuffed jumbo prawns were the best dishes.  Prices were a bit steep  but it was expected at a restaurant inside the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,After a failed attempt during my last trip here I finally was able to give Olives a try.   Hubs and I had lunch outside overlooking the fountains. I ordered the crab pasta off the special menu of the day ($25.) Hubs ordered the crab stuffed prawns scampi ($26.) We shared a mixed greens salad ($14.) Total without gratuity was $70.27.  We devoured the complimentary bread basket with spreads and olives. The assorted bread was great I was in carb heaven  the cheese crisp was good and the spreads were delicious on the fresh bread.   Our entrees took about 30 minutes and was served all together. I thought the salad would be served first. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the crab meat was sweet. The portion was perfect almost too much pasta (and that is being said by an Italian) Hubs enjoyed the stuffed prawns. He said it was probably the best meal during our trip. The mixed green salad was just okay nothing exciting nor memorable.   Service was wonderful. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. The water glasses were always full and they remove the plates after both of us were finished.   I couldn't have asked for much more it was a nice meal outside with beautiful surroundings and perfect weather with Hubs.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Seating in patio is worth yhe wait....an inside view of the fountains is to die fir.....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Loved my lunch for two here...I made a reservation and got a table with a view of the Bellagio fountain show.  loved the olive tapenade spread and the variety of bread served to the table.    We had the octopus /squid appetizer...it was tender  and so good I almost ordered it again for my entree.  However my taste for adventure prevailed and I ended eating the seared scalloped amazing!  and my handsome lunch companion enjoyed the steak frites.. which I enjoyed as well. great cut of meat so tender & tasty.  I can't wait to come back and try this place again..  oh and don't forget the staff here is wonderful  amazing  on the ball folks!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My second time to eat here and this time it was with my honey and the food was again really great! I must repeat that ordering from the starters menu should be good. Unless you are starving or a professional eater  you do not need a starter and a main course. I did make this mistake and stuffed myself to the point of discomfort. I had the white bean soup  which was heavenly and the scallops  which were equally as good. It will be tough when I come back to decide which dish to order. As always  the service was top notch!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We heard from several people this was a great place. Sure  the decor was nice. And if the weather permits you can sit out on a nice patio overlooking the lake. But the service was indifferent (at best) and the food was nothing exciting. For ""casual"" dining it was also a bit expensive."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Spectacular.   From the architecture & ambience  to the view  to the wine  to the meal cooked to perfection  to the educated and friendly service  I do not think I've had a more memorable experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was here for a late lunch and was fortunate to get a table.  I got an order of the Lamajoun flatbread and a random glass of red wine.  The Lamajoun basically resembled an open-faced shawarma  with the intense lamb flavors and bread standing out.  It was definitely delicious and probably worth the Las Vegas inflation rate.  The service was kinda meh  but the Lamajoun saved it from being a real issue.  Overall  good stuff.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was okay. They charged us 2 more dollars than the menu. My ribeye was $59 on menu but they charged me $61 For it. The manager never came out to apologize. The waiter  Robby  said it was the system. It made  me believe they over charged everyone who ordered food there. My colleagues also were over charged even when they ordered different items from the menu. You don't cheat customers. Image all the people who were over charged and didn't even noticed. You guys have no integrity and I will never come back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've been to Olives a couple of times  and it's never disappointed with the food.   I was disappointed with the table.  They have their wall opened to a mall  and we sat right next to that wall.  So it was very distracting as everyone kept walking by and looking in the restaurant.  Also  we were so far away from the window where the fountains were performing.  It would have been nice to at least have a peek at the fountains.  But as I said  the food has never disappointed.  I had scallops and they were big and juicy and yummy.  My friend had the salmon and said it was delightful too.   I also ordered lobster mac and cheese for the table  but I wouldn't recommend that.  It was cold and not very flavorful.    Always a good alternative in Vegas  where there are so many good restaurants to choose from.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We spent the early evening here and loved every minute of it. Assuming the weather is tolerable  I recommend a patio table. The view of the fountains and accompanying music just makes the meal that much more enjoyable. The staff was fantastic  we were very well taken care of. When I couldn't decide which dish to order  I was brought a half and half of both! Even with reservations  a line will build out front. Do what you can to get a great table (there are plenty) because you're going to want to stay a while.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is still our favorite dining experience in Vegas. Food choices are impeccable. They starter hors d'ouvres of olive tapenade and breads sets the tone. Would always recommend the beef tenderloin. Chocolate cake for dessert is a must especially if you are with date. If looking for pasta  mix it up a little and go with gnocchi.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is a disaster!  The prices do not reflect the poor quality of the food.  I ordered the rib eye steak and it was ultra thin  gritty  and overcooked and it was topped with a sauce that did not complement the rest of the meal.  The steak was no better than what you would receive at Denny's at 2 AM in the morning.  This place is way over priced and the food flat out sucks.  Todd English needs to re-evaluate the direction of Olives.  I felt this way the first time around and I didn't say anything  but after my second visit to the restaurant I couldn't let my disappointment in the cuisine slide.  The public needs to know that this restaurant is a rip off.   If you want good food go to BOAS or the Stratosphere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great dining experience every part of our dining experience was wavelength from appetizer to main course . Paul our server was courteous and superb . We have stayed at Bellagio many times and this was our first time at Olives. It will be one of our must eat places when next we visit .
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our experience at olives was excellent from start to finish. I had a reservation for 5pm (to which I arrived late but got accommodated with no issues!)  and was seated outside with the most amazing view to the fountain show.  We started around 5:40ish with drinks and let our waitress know we had tickets for O at 7:30. She promised she would keep track of time so we didn't have to and got us out of there with time to spare. Their food all sounded amazing so we had a hard time picking what to eat and once our dinner arrived we were impressed with the presentation and flavor. Def worth going  we will try to go back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I enjoyed a long Columbus Day weekend in Las Vegas and stayed at the Mandalay Bay. One afternoon in our must see visit to the Bellagio we stumbled across this restaurant . Loved it .....the cocktails were outstanding and the flat bread dishes on the lunch menu were the best we ever had. We came back again the next day to try again and were just as delighted with the pasta   sharing a delicious butternut squash tortellini.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,You'd think when making a reservation 2 weeks in advance that they would try to accommodate us. Especially considering that it was my wife's birthday and our anniversary. I requested a view seat but did not get one. I wasn't even placed next to a window. I had the view of the window 1 table away. Just terrible. The hostess was a bit too blunt for my liking. That being said our waiter  John  did provide us exceptional service. After doing some careful research I learned that the OLiVES lease has not been renewed by Bellagio. I worried about this prior to our dinner and certainly my experience echoed my concern.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sat outdoors in the cute patio on a warm night.  Every 15 minutes or so  the gorgeous Bellagio Fountain performed for us.  The waitresses were very nice and accommodating.    Had the Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass with a citrus glaze. It was delicious!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our party of 4 sat at the bar since that was the only seating available at the time.  We enjoyed the food as well as the bartenders  Zach  Ernie and John.  John took some tome to explain the infused fruit vodka drinks that were on the back shelf.  Our food was great and the atmosphere was as exciting as you would expect in a Casino restaurant.  We plan on returning on our next visit to Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Our favorite lunch spot in Vegas. From the outstanding service  food  and spectacular view of the Bellagio fountain  Olives is perfect in every way.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love this place  especially for lunch. Beef carpaccio is a must. Their flat breads and hamburger are always good. Get a table outside or inside by the window and enjoy the fountain show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was really looking forward to eating here as I'm a sucker for Mediterranean food. But I was pretty disappointed. Had the squid and octopus to start - the octopus was pretty mediocre even with a strange flavor  the squid overcooked and chewy. Had the scallops and prosciutto  it was only ok.   The decor was great and the service fine. The glass of wine I had was quite good.   But I came for the food and it was a serious disappointment.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We arrived about 10 minutes late for our reservation and were seated 10 minutes after that.  Our server quickly took our drink order which arrived soon after.  But then our server apparently forgot us as I had to go find her 30 minutes later.  She did have a large table sit down near us but still seemed to not realize we were there.    Once we ordered our food arrived in a normal amount of time.  The food was very good.  But we were there for 2 hours without appetizers  salads  or dessert.  Only 1 bottle of wine for 4 people and our meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had high hopes for Olives  which were dashed by extremely poor food  horrible service  noise  and high prices.  My fiance and I were promptly seated at our tiny table  even though we were early for our reservation.  The lovely restaurant is dark and candlelit at night. When we arrived  the noise level was manageable  but when we left our ears were ringing.     Our server  Ralph  came to our table promptly to take our drink order.  Ralph was brusque; at no point did I feel welcome.  My Bellini arrived shortly thereafter but was devoid of peach flavor.  Our tuna tartare appetizer looked lovely: the tuna sat atop a a spun cucumber salad (spun?) that was wrapped with strips of cucumber.  Alas  there was no flavor to the dish  possibly due to the absence of the sesame dressing and the whitefish caviar.  The only thing we devoured were the crispy rock shrimp.   We left much of the appetizer on the plate.   Then we waited...and waited...and waited.  We snacked on the bread basket that arrived with two olive tapenades and a small dish of olives.  About 25 minutes after our appetizer dishes had been cleared  Ralph returned to ask if I wanted another cocktail - my glass had been empty for some time.  He assured me our entrees would be out shortly.  Five minutes later they appeared  their temperature indicating that they had been sitting under the heat lamp for a while.  The base of my ""Duck Two Ways"" was pasta  which I could not even see because sauce ran from rim to rim.  Carrot curls (tasteless) and apricot chutney (apricot? really? all I tasted was onion) were piled on top of my duck breast  which was seared on the outside but completely raw  difficult to cut  and impossible to chew.  The entire breast  save one bite  remained on my plate uneaten.  The breast sat on what was described as rilletes made from duck confit.  This was tasty and made a nice accompaniment for the pasta that was buried under all the bland sauce  which occasionally tasted of rosemary.  My fiance had ordered ""Roasted Maine Lobster Carbonara.""  The overcooked and rubbery lobster was another disappointment.  The pasta had congealed into a solid mass that could be picked up with your fork.  We contemplated sending it all back  but since we had waited more than thirty minutes for it  we went ahead and ate.  When my fiance complained about the dishes  the manager came over to make sure we would ""not leave hungry.""  While I would not have left hungry (I had eaten some of both the appetizer and the entree  and very good bread with olive tapenade)  I really don't believe that is the point.  When you pay well over $100 for a dinner  you expect a good meal and a certain level of service.  Olives offered us neither.  My advice is to spend your money elsewhere - Olives is not worth it."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I would not recommend this place at all we were charged $50.00 for table reservation.  And waited still for one hour to be seated. It seems that Todd English has to nickel and dime customer to get them in to eat at his restaurant. There are alot more better service and food then this place in Las Vegas. We were all disappointed and will not ever come back here. AND OLIVE IS OPENING UP IN DOWNEY  CA. Don't go  go somewhere  for better food and service . The food is served cold.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really disappointing that they didn't sing the bday song they promise for my sister.  Food is just ok. Atmosphere is ok  it's a bit noisy. We have to yell to talk to my family. Waiter attitude is ok.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We made a reservation through our casino host  hoping to pull some strings and snag one of the coveted outside tables near the fountain.  No such luck; all the fountain-view tables are wait-list only  meaning  you show up for your reservation and just wait.  Our reservation was for 9:30  and they informed us upon arrival that since it was so late  and they already had a long wait list for outside  there was no chance we were getting one.  Bummer!  I thought our chance might be better with a late reservation  so heed my warning.  We did get a decent booth with a view of the water.  I like that this restaurant has a casual dress code  but maybe they go a bit too far; the guy at the next table was attired in a wife-beater and shorts (9:30 on a Sunday night).  The bread was yummy  and more like a dessert - white chocolate walnut rolls!  We shared a shrimp scampi flatbread and it was too heavy/creamy so we just picked off the shrimp.  For my main I had the Chilean Seabass - this was incredible!  I loved the whole dish  and the portion was huge.  DH had the Ribeye and enjoyed it.  For dessert we had cookies and ice cream - yum :)  We also ordered the Falling Out cake  but it was too liquidy and rich  with too little ice cream (one tiny scoop) to accompany it  so we ended up not really eating it.  Overall  the restaurant was just okay.  Although the seabass was delicious  I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here  especially without a fountain view.  The tables are too crowded together; we got lucky with the booth  but most of the tables are lined up with inches between them.  There are too many other good places to eat in Vegas for the $$$.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This would be AND SHOULD BE 5 stars  but it won't be...read on. This place  was amazing. We had an outside table right at the railing overlooking the fountains - it was incredible (although on a windy day  you could and would get soaked). The wine  food  waitstaff  all incredible. I don't think it matters what you order  it'll all be wonderful. So  why not 5 stars you ask. There was a couple sitting next to us who seemed nice enough. They obviously were having a nice dinner...just like us. However  by about mid-meal  they were standing for every fountain show....right in front of me! After the 3rd one  I kindly asked if they could move to the other side - what a mouth on the lady....the guy  gravity had taken over and his brain (and proper sense) was seated between his navel and his knees.   Anyways  so time went on  still enjoying the water show and the food. The lady still had her man up for the water show  but she had progressed to humping him to the music. We nicely said something  but at this point  the wait staff should have intervened. I even said something to the wait staff - he just smiled and said she is driving everyone crazy...oh good! She asked my dinner partner to take a picture with her and I was happy he said no. She got some other poor young innocent guy to take pictures with her and he was clearly uncomfortable as she was running her hands across his hips - yes from side to side...across the front  all while her dinner mate was taking pictures. For that poor young kid's sake  I hope those photos do not show up on some website somewhere...surely they will. Anyways  he finally had the good sense to weasel his way out of her grip  but then she started ""posing"" while leaning on our table! I and my dinner mate had finally had enough. I said something to her and my dinner mate said something to her dinner mate. Those comments got her off of our table (after she mumbled some choice words in our direction)  but that was not all she put in our direction. She promptly sat in her chair  legs spread wide open  and her dinner mate taking pictures.   So  any question on why this did not get 5 stars? Olives has an obligation (for our $300 meal for two) to provide us with an exquisite dining experience. They got oh so close  but could not pull the trigger on these other guests. I have to assume that they were as shocked as we were and that shock somehow paralyzed them. That paralysis cost them a 5 star rating.  I would absolutely go back. That is not ever in question. But if my $300 meal includes a soft porn show  then I will go straight to management with my right to dine absent the show."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had lunch there  just walked up  with no reservation. It was just me  because my friends were still in the hotel  hungover. It was a beautiful day  and they had a balcony  so I thought it would be awesome if I had lunch on the balcony.  Unfortunately I was seated inside. I assume they probably only seat groups of 2 or more out there perhaps.   The interior is really dark and dim  which is too bad. Would have been nice to get some sunlight because of the great weather. I noticed there was a narrow corridor past the bar that had seating near large windows though.   Anyway  digressing a bit here but  the lack of outdoor seating in vegas made me realize how spoiled Minnesotan's are with abundant outdoor rooftop dining and patio dining. It was incredibly hard to find that in vegas! Which is weird considering they have such great weather. Who wouldn't want to eat outdoors and soak in the sun?  Alright  back to the review: the butternut squash tortelli was delicious! It had a hint of cookie in it. So original and tasty! Loved it. The $24 glass of red wine I had along with the meal was fantastic. Smooth and rich. The best glass of cabernet I've had in a long time! Too bad I forgot the brand name of it...  I didn't get a chance to eat at any other restaurants on the Strip since we mostly ate at cheaper areas like Chinatown and downtown Vegas  so I can't compare Olives with the other places on the Strip.  However Olives was definitely my favorite dining experience on the trip  not to mention the prices at Olives were actually incredibly reasonable for the quality and style of food.   I was a bit nervous trying it out blindly  I usually check Yelp before going to places  but it all worked out! I'm pleasantly surprised and pleased!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I don't do five star reviews often but everything about this place is amazing  the portions the vino - EVERYTHING.   Had the carpaccio and it was insane  put it on the thin crackers and it's very flavorful. That dish is definitely meant to be shared. Also had the sirloin on mashed potatoes and it was spot on!  The sommelier recommended a bottle called Taken  it's a merlot and Cabernet blend  super tasty !!!    We told our server to let the chef know it was excellent and a couple minutes later the chef came out to thank us  we a super cool touch for my customer.   Great place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had dinner here on Valentines Day and we were very impressed with the menu as well as the atmosphere.. They have quite an assortment of yummy appetizers and entrees. Considering this is a fine dining restaurant in Bellagio overlooking the strip  pricing is reasonable. Definitely recommend the patio seating which has heaters and overlooks the famous water show !
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had the seafood risotto and it was overly salty and oily. I wouldn't recommend the dish. The desert I had was delicious  however. I ordered the chocolate and peanut butter cake.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"For ""finer"" dining in Las Vegas this place was kind of disappointing. Grilled calamari & octopus was a tad rubbery  my husband's scallops were extremely salty and undercooked  and while my grilled sea bass  itself was cooked nicely  the corn pudding was cold (I don't think it was supposed to be). The chocolate hazelnut souffle (that we waited for for 20 minutes -standard time) was impressive looking when brought out  but then the server made the executive decision on his own to put the scoop of ice cream directly inside our souffle. That was presumptuous  we like to keep it on the side.  After all  we did wait 20 minutes for a HOT souffle!  Better luck next time."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,3 star only for their bread. Their breads are delicious  I had to ask them to bring out another bowl. I went there to try out their crabcake fritter  but they ran out. I then settle with the Cesar salad  because I didn't want anything else since I was craving for the crabcake. Maybe it just me  maybe I'm not high-class enough. I just don't get why their Cesar salad isn't chopped up. It comes out as few leafs on top of few tomatoes  cheese  and croutons. Dressing was like olive oil and maybe a little bit of Cesar dressing. I prefer my salad full  chopped-up  and actually looking like a salad  not something that was plucked off a few minutes ago. My fried got the veal special pasta. He didn't like it too much either. I'm not coming back to this place unless it's for their bread.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've dined here many times. I think I need at least two hands or count the number of times I've dined her over the past few years. Tonight was by far the worst experience I've had at this restaurant. I was dining alone  the second time ive dined here alone but the first evening. The staff is very nice but when busy  not very attentive. I sat waiting for someone for more than 15 minutes to stop by the table. The food is okay but not fantastic this evening. This has not always been the experience but tonight I was left wanting more from the chef. The foie gras appetizer was a hot. The duck Ragu was awful. The corn overpowered the duck with sweetness unexpected. The gnocchi was mushy - not perfectly cooked by a long shot. Disappointing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very solid meal here. The complimentary bread and spreads were very tasty.   Fig prosciutto flatbread (4 stars): very tasty and savory  Chilean Sea Bass (4 stars): the corn pudding on the side added a pleasant sweet note to the dish
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"To contradict what some of the ""this place has changed"" folks  I found Olives to be at least as good as before.  This is such an enjoyable dining room.  The bread basket  tapanades  and olives alone would make a meal  and I wondered how much of it I  as a solo dinner  could eat without embarrassment (answer:  a lot).  The ceaser salad and flat bread pizza  along with a fine pinot noir  were exceptional eating.  Staff was friendly  but not warm.  Truly  this is delicious food and a lovely experience  pricey  but it's the Bellagio!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So glad I read these reviews and had the beef carpaccio - it was delicious and the presentation was beautiful!  We had a reservation and were seated after a 5 minute wait.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had no idea what to expect of the restaurant prior to actually going there other than the short blurb about it in our room. We went on a busy Friday night and got in without a wait. The bread guy gets an A+. The sweet bread with olive spread was great. The waiter was ok  I tried to order my flat bread without lamb and for some reason he wasnt having it. It was kind of a weird soup nazi moment about lamb.  I was confused. The waiter gets a C for his lamb weirdness. The bartender doesnt have much skill other than pouring stuff for drunk frat guys. I ordered a good Anejo tequila and he threw a lime in it with a sword stuffed through it???
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"What an amazing dining experience. I booked my table on opentable.com in early June for tonight as a celebration for my 3 year anniversary with my boyfriend. I wrote in the comments of the reservation ""please make sure you sit us by the fountains outside if possible"". That's it.... what did I get? A table for 2 right on the edge in the center of the outdoor patio. I was just floored...but it didn't stop there. The service was fabulous  the food was so delicious (really what you expect from the dining experience and very reasonably priced) and when we were about to leave  we received a complimentary dessert from the staff that had 3 gourmet chocolate truffles that had ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate in chocolate. It really made our anniversary super special and I will always remember the experience fondly for the fantastic blend of outstanding service  amazing food and a breathtaking view of the falls at sunset! :) Perfect!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Staff is very friendly and accommodating. For appetizer I got the fig and prosciutto Flatbread which was good but not really a value when it comes to price. Now I understand when it comes to Vegas everything is expensive but $21 for a Flatbread app that didn't wow me is a bit much. Same issue with the dinner entree. I had the pork chop which wasn't bad but want unique. It tasted like any normal pork chop. Maybe my expectations were too high but I wasn't impressed at all  especially at those prices. My advice is you could always try something else and as the food wasn't bad  I don't think I would go back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for restaurant week 2012. $50.12 for 3 course dinner.  5 stars for the Bellagio fountain view. 3.5 stars for the food.   Venue: Decent sized restaurant with great view of the Bellagio fountain when you sit outside.  Service: was good. Server constantly came to check on us and helped us take multiple photos :)  Food: Complimentary Bread and Olives (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=QGy2akDArGCERH9U9bqUqg) - OMG their Breads are sooo good and i think they are fresh baked in house too! I had to ask for seconds.  Jumbo crab salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=S5coFUVVZqdl6_mr0nMwUA) - This salad was really good!! It had large pieces of crab mixed with. Great Presentation.  Vegetarian tart (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=lj3RPIjbpfPvoh2sAm3_Jw) - This one was very tasty as well. Tasted like a thin crust pizza with thin slices of squash on top.  Black cod (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=tHt9c087_EdPqod0x1xgNg) - The cod was moist and came with some mashed potatoes. Overall this dish was slightly better than mediocre.   Mascarpone strawberry cheesecake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/QJR4qBUHegWEozSQrGmBPw?select=reYczOIuUb05FHpvPO1OXQ) - This one was pretty decent. The cheesecake was dense  but I still had better.  Price: I wouldn't pay more than $50.12 for this 3 course meal.   Overall: This experience was well worth it to have such a great view of the Bellagio fountains. Food was just okay... But good deal for the price.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,MM! I love this place!  My bf took me here for lunch on one of our trips to Vegas and it was absolutely delish!  First off  I have to absolutely recommend the peach Bellini.  I usually don't like this kind of mixed drink..I'm more of a wine/Champagne or vodka gimlet girl  but I just could not resist when I read the description - sparkling wine and peach puree..SOOO GOOD!  My memory is a little hazy on what my bf ordered  but I ordered the Olive burger.  I know  I was thinking it would be too heavy  but how can you resist a burger that comes with a balsamic glazed onions and PARMESAN FRIES (I am in a deep french fries obsession).  It was no short of amazing.  Decor-wise  the place is beautiful as well.  It also has an outdoor seating area which I'm looking forward to sitting at when we go back for dinner.  The only reason why I cannot give this place 5 stars is because of their carpaccio.  It was horrid.  They pile on so much carpaccio onto your plate  it looks unappetizing..I feel like carpaccio is something that should be presented  in a way that portrays how delicate it is...I found out  there really can be too much carpaccio.  And I do recall  it started to taste a little gamey and it seemed to be sliced a little thick - my bf and I really really did not enjoy this dish.  The oysters were pretty unappetizing...couldn't really tell if they were supposed to be raw on the half shell or baked? Kinda confusing..and the taste didnt make up for its looks.  I dont recommend ordering the oysters at all!! (Then again  what do expect when you come from the coast to eat in the desert)  But other than the carpaccio  it was an absolutely delightful lunch and we're really looking forward to our next meal here! :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The free bread with olive spread is delicious. Overall good and cheapest place to watch the fountains while you eat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The wait after you order is pretty bad. It took over an hour to get out main course at lunch. Big waste of time. Can't say it's like this for everyone since even people who came later than us got their food earlier so I think it's just hit or miss based on disorganization. The food is OK. I wouldn't come here just for the food though. The only shining light to this experience is that they served us foie gras when it's not available for lunch. But it is available for dinner  so why not just make it available at all times instead of making people ask for it?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My friends and I had reservations at Todd English's OLiVES.  Located in the Bellagio  it was really nice to walk through such a famous casino and dine in style.  I also liked that their drink menu was on an iPad so you could pick a fancy drink!  I had the Ricotta Ravioli  and it was delicious!  Very good  and the menu had a ton of other options.  The portion sizes weren't too much  and everything tasted really fresh.  In addition  there were definitely affordable options like flatbreads that made this a very accessible restaurant for such a fancy location and offering.  I would definitely eat there again  if only to try to get seating on the coveted patio overlooking the Bellagio's famous water fountain show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have never had a bad meal at Olives. Great food  exceptional service  nice view of the Bellagio Fountains. It's not cheap  but worth every penny.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The beef carpaccio really is all that. Polenta  greens  three sauces...complex yet balanced. Interesting yet approachable. This was recommended by a chef I work with  and he was right on: this dish rocks.  Also: fabulous service.  Next time I'm at the Bellagio  this is a no-brainer. Will definitely go back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I am an olive obsessed person so I've been dying to try this place since my first visit to Vegas in 2012. 4 years later I finally got to try this place out! Although the half the reason I wanted to try this place was for the view  it was a 9:30pm reservation so we settled for indoor seating without a view of the fountain (plus it was FREEZING).  Ordered: x GRILLED SQUID AND OCTOPUS (vinaigrette of chickpeas  tomatoes  toasted garlic  parsley) - way too much chickpeas and not enough grilled squid. Not what I was expecting at all :( x PORTOBELLO FLATBREAD (wild mushroom puree  herb roasted portobello  red onions  fontina cheese  white truffle oil) - YUMMY. This was my favorite of the night. I LOVEEE portobello mushrooms  so with some truffle oil... game over. x SMOKED SALMON FLATBREAD (chive whipped potato  shaved red onions  caper creme fraiche) - This was good  but I just felt like I was eating a thin lox bagel. Not something I'd order again. x SPINACH RAVIOLI - I forget what else was in this one  but it was special on the tasting menu and we asked if we could order just that. This ravioli was VERY good. Highly recommend ordering if you're a vegetarian. x BUTTERNUT SQUASH TORTILLA (brown butter  amaretto cookies  sage  parmesan cheese) - Eh... the sauce was way too sweet for my savory dish. I hate that more than anything in the world. it was well made  but just not made for my tongue.  They serve olives  tapenade  and a bread basket to start. Everything was soooo good! They even had the cheesy bread crisp I love so much from Joe's Seafood at Caesars!!  I'd give the food 3 stars and the service 4 stars. 3.5 rounded up to 4 for ambience and everything else. Definitely want to come back try some of their entrees.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,everything seemd salty and over seasoned at olives. we started with a salad and olive tapenade for the bread. we literally could not eat the tapenade it was so salty. the olives were marinated in the brine too long  also inedible due to the extreme sodium content.  you start to question the chef's palate when things arrive so salty they are inedible. either that or he is not tasting the food as they go out. on the other hand  the croutons seemed like they were battered and fried like tempura  and they were very good.  my wife had the free range chicken which was just ok  and i had a mushroom ravioli that was underwhelming. one other thing  the seating is too close together and results in a very awkward atmosphere.  it's almost like teppan dining where you are eating with complete strangers.  not my cup of tea. was not impressed overall with todd english.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here for a dinner  (wanted to go to the Bellagio buffet but the line was too long) and it was sub par. Neither of us enjoyed our meals  and that's not so good when you're forking out 150 bucks. I ordered a martini  and what I got was basically a glass filled to the brim with nail polish remover and some festive olives. Honestly  this drink was so nasty  I would have rather drank rubbing alcohol. I would have rather drank Nyquil. Blegh.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Holy Crap Crap Crap  this was so Good Good Good. We were passing through Vegas and decided to pit stop for a little lunch and gambling and ended up at the Bellagio. I know that as far as food goes in Vegas it's hard not to find something good  but this was ridiculous. It has one of the greatest patio views; we sat right next to the water over looking the fountains and strip. Prices are very reasonable for Vegas  key part ""for Vegas"". The table is provided a mixed bread basket with an assortment of amazing tapenade. Everyone loved their meals  and my Mojito  though girly  was delicious. Next time I'm in Vegas  I will be back. I hope my 600th review of this place was just what you needed to convince yourself to go."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We didn't have reservations but the menu looked good and it's a famous chefs name on it. We walked up to the hostess podium and ask if they could seat 2 without a reservation. They looked down in to the book  and the second hostess started walking toward the door with 2 menus. No conversation as to yes we do have availability or come with me or anything. I asked the hostess  are we supposed to follow her? Yes! she quipped.  So anyway we are seated at a 2 top near the entrance and was handed a iPad type thing and told we could look at and order drinks from that and we were also handed a menu?!?!? Ok we are at a Small 2 top where do I sit this thing down? A minute or two after that a server named Richard approached and was very gracious and reviews the drinks and menu with us and another server brought some olive spread and some olives and bread that were very good.  Things were turning around because of the server. We ordered flat bread with figs and prosciutto. It was very good and served hot and the thin bread was fresh and tasty. I ordered the scallop with risotto and it was very good in flavor but the risotto rice was still s little hard. My husband ordered to pasta special and it was cooked well but I didn't care for it  had a cinnamon like flavor that overpowered the light tomato sauce. The man at the table next to us orders the same thing as my husband and the portion size was totally different as well as the sauce. His was very dark with sauce while my husbands was lightly covered  so some inconsistency there.  I observed the salads and other plates coming out and everything looked really good and decent portions.  I would just give Olives a OK but I wouldn't go back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Perfection! Went here for my anniversary over the weekend. Service was top notch and the view was spectacular.   I had the sea scallops over a bed of creamy mushroom risotto. So flavorful! My bf had a tenderloin steak that was just melt in your mouth amazing.  I finished my meal with an espresso martini  I've been having fantasies about it ever since   The staff really went above and beyond to make the night special and the food was incredible. We will definitely be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My bf took me here for my birthday. Olives has a gorgeous view of the Bellagio water show. Do ask to be seated by the window if you can.   As for the food  we had one hit and one miss.  The blue nose bass - This was one of the specials on the menu. Blue nose bass has a similar texture to Chilean sea bass  perhaps slightly rougher. The waiter recommended the Chilean sea bass but this one had a more unique pairing. When I find the exact ingredients  I'll add it here =P   The ribeye - What sucked me in were the croquettes which turned out to be less than spectacular. The ribeye was also not marbleized at all. It tasted more like a mediocre flat iron steak.   The bread basket with the olive spreads were pretty delicious. I liked the slight sweet raisin like bread in the basket the best.   I was a tad sad that the meal was on the expensive side but the food was not all around solid. Ah well  I still loved the view and of course the company =P I think this is a great place for appetizers and happy hour to soak in the gorgeous view but I'd probably skip dinner here again. And if you plan to come here for dinner  stick to the bass.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you are going here make reservations at night  make them for the patio  so that you can enjoy the fountain. I had high hopes for this place because of all of the great reviews  but the food was just OK.  It wasn't bad  but I was not blown away.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The basics: tasty food  great bar  beautiful decor and good service.   The highlight: The chestnut ravioli was outstanding.  The incredibly annoying: Olives is the only restaurant at the Bellagio with patio/outdoor seating overlooking the lake/water show  and not only is it an unbelievably minuscule space  but they will not take reservations for those tables - they are first come first serve  even if you have a reservation. It's ridiculous and offensive.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,great lunch spot  amazing bloody marys  awesome olive spread and breads! everything on the menu is good- very casual and good prices  considering you are at the Bellagio. $74 dollars- and we did not hold back  acutally overordered (2 ppl) Great service- we left happy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I made a reservation here for my boyfriends birthday. We were a party of three  and one of us is a vegetarian. We picked this place because it claimed to be perfect place for vegetarians. The current menu was not online  so we went for it.  We sat down  took one look at the menu  and found 1 vegetarian entree. How can you possibly claim your restaurant is vegetarian friendly with 1 entree? To top it off  we told the hostess on our way out that we didn't realize that they only had 1 entree for vegetarians and we would not be staying for dinner  her response was ""we have several vegetarian dishes."" Uh  yeah  right."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Sooo yummy! We got the spicy chicken flatbread for an appitizer and I got the butternut squash tortallini....it was amazing! I definitely recommend it. My dad got the lobster pasta dish and said it was fantastic. My brother got the rib eye and said it was very flavorful  but had a little too much marble. Overall a fantastic meal!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Always try the Chef's Specials listed in the middle of the menu!  Delish!  First off Joey V.  Raul  Chris  Ernie  Regina who loved to Lago  all are the best bartenders!  The new GM is also the sweetest.    The focaccia bread & black olive tapenade are the most delicious!  The moist tasty focaccia is also very filling.  If they have Copper River Salmon in the chefs special  it is a MUST!  Trust me.   Excellent wine list & awesome happy hour & regular menu.  Three things you cannot go wrong with:  Beef Carpaccio absolutely the best!  I love putting the black olive tapenade on the polenta under the beef carpaccio.  The balsamic gives it such a sweet kick.  Butternut Squash Tortillini has a sweet & delightful nutmeg taste that keeps you coming back.  Grilled Squid & Octopus melts together with the garbanzo beans.  Also the pineapple & the blueberry infused vodkas are very good. The burger & many other salads & menu items are also so yummy.  I am a regular there so will update on other items.  Cheers!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Alright  so this review is way overdue.  I have been wanting to try this place for a long time now  and restaurant week was a great excuse to splurge a bit.  We visited Olives on the last day of restaurant week  which was Sunday March 4th.  When we were being seated my girlfriend remembered they had an outdoor seating area and although it was a bit chilly  she asked the hostess if we could have a table outside.  The hostess made a quick check to make sure it was available and swiftly sat us on the patio.  Although the indoor area was dimly lit and romantic  the patio is even more romantic especially when the fountain show goes off.  The chill factor was not a problem  as they had heaters next to each table outside.    For starters  the bread basket as a whole is pretty decent.  The white chocolate bread stands out in my mind.  I could eat that bread every day of my life and perfectly happy.  I will return  just for that bread.  It's delicious and quite unique  in my opinion.    We ordered from the $50.00/pp menu.  I ordered the vegetable tart for my appetizer  the roasted chicken for my entree  and the sorbet for dessert.  Everything was good  nothing was outstanding.  My dining partner had the crab salad  the filet  and cheesecake.  The crab salad was quite refreshing.  The filet was tender and flavorful.  The cheesecake was moist and a perfect portion to end the meal.  It was restaurant week so I didn't expect knock my socks off kind of food.  We both had a glass of wine too. I didn't feel ripped off.  We left satisfied and the patio experience made up for mediocre food.  The service wasn't spectacular  but was satisfactory.   For three courses for two  two glasses of wine  and a stunning view our bill came to around $135.  For a romantic evening with that special someone  this is a great choice  especially if you can sit on the patio.  I plan on visiting again in the future.  Next time  I'll order off of the full price menu.  Oh yeah  and I'll ask for extra white chocolate bread too!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives was our go to place in Vegas- until this trip. We went on the 4th of July for my bday and my fiance's bday was the day before so we were looking to celebrate. We made reservations weeks in advance and called days before like clockwork to let them know we wanted the outdoor seating and we were celebrating. we were told to come half hour early to be accommodated. Once I showed up they told me it would be 2 hours. WTF? food is decent we really go to sip wine on the balcony. The manager truly did not care to make this a memorable dining experience.  We go to Vegas about 3 times a year and now will be going to Mastros. We had a lovely experience there and they called the next day to ask about it. I like places that go above and beyond and sorry- Olives surely does not.   Also  no bday desert like mentioned on phone :( BAD SERVICE
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"A dining experience filled with continuous disappointments from the staff and management.  Shame on Ralph  our waiter for the evening  as well as General manager Valentin  for their overzealous egos.  The bus service from more than one  that tended to our table throughout the night  were a bother as well.  I've had some bad service in my time  but never from such a well known restaurant.        Such a nice looking place too.  With its mediterranean motif and lake front seating.  Where you can sit and enjoy the breathtaking fountains.         But on to the evening  starting with a packed house  overly loud atmosphere...gotta love those loud talkers.  Staff seriously looked overwhelmed.  Probably due to the table layout  as there were so many and too close to each other. Not only that  aisles were crammed with the staff  making it difficult to move around.  No flow... something or someone is suffering.   -Where to begin but from the first visit to our table by waiter Ralph.  The waiter sets the tone and mood for the evening. His arrogant presence was obvious and felt.  He displayed the lack of pleasantries  and table ethics.  Only his rushed presence  condescending arrogant attitude was left.  Oh and please don't touch the customer  even if it is only on the shoulder. He touched my guest on the shoulder a handful of times. What's up with that?  Eye contact is very important in service when it comes to interacting with the customer.  The customer should be made to feel important  comfortable  and confident that their needs for the night will be met with a smile.  What a nuisance not knowing who the hell he was looking at behind those large black framed glasses.  He made us feel not only rushed when placing our order  but also all other times he came to the table.  He was not thorough with our table needs for the duration of our visit  as if he either didn't hear us half the time  or he just couldn't handle how busy it was.  When being served our food  he didn't even set the plates down properly.  Handing off one of the dishes to my guest instead of placing it down himself. Really?  I can go on an on with him.  But you get the picture.    -Bus service? Wtf is with clanging of the plates  banging the water glasses. Reaching over people a number of times  almost brushed my face a few times.  Don't be lazy  take the damn glasses off the table when you refill. Any one of them at any given time would reach  clang  and interrupt conversations.  One thing also  please don't come to the table wanting to clear plates in such a haste  then waiving the index finger in a pointing manor saying only  ""you done? you done?"" Wtf is that?  Where's the training? Are you guys short of plates?   -On to the food Each of us received our own olive tapenade which was excellent. Kalamata and Green Olive tapenade was accompanied with collection of whole olives(with pits) -The appetizers we ordered:   - Grilled Squid and Octopus was just ok. Squid was tender  but the Octopus was overcooked.    - Prosciutto with Fig Jam Flatbread was very good (recommended)  but could use a bit more jam though.  - Entrees were:   - Chilean Sea Bass was ok. Tender  but the flavor was boring.    - Atlantic Salmon was overcooked  when originally ordered medium rare. When replaced  the flavor didn't muster.  Evidentially the recipe was changed from a year prior.   The reason why dessert wasn't ordered was because we felt our experience and mood were shot. We just had to find the nearest exit. But before we left  my guests felt compelled to speak to the manager regarding the array of mishaps throughout dinner. They couldn't believe how bad it was either  when a year prior  they had a great experience.     - Enter Valentin the GM. When my guest was expressing his concerns  he keep cutting him off not only miss understanding him  but also  quick to be apologetic and move on.  Meaning he apologizes over and over again  instead of taking the time to listen. My guest couldn't even finish with expressing all the concerns. My guest just gave up. To top it off  he was asking my guest what he wants.  Are you kidding me? Yes  since you asked  I would like world peace.  You know what  don't ask  just do it.  Be creative  fair and professional. Mind you this whole time  never addressing me or my other guest. If you're going to put out a fire at a table  make sure it's all out. Asking the table of their concerns. At the end of the night  after paying the check  I must say Ralph didn't deserve a tip. So he didn't get one. The comical part of that is  once he saw the big zero  he looked up and thanked us with a condescending tone. Sorry buddy  tips are earned not expected.      -Bottom line is  if we're not happy  or satisfied  someone is not doing their job.              I won't return as there are too many other great restaurants walking distance from each other.        I really hope Bellagio takes some time to reevaluate service and quality control in their establishment."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had a very high hopes for Olives. It is a beautiful place and the fountains certainly add a lot of drama. The Bellagio is a lovely if somewhat dated hotel.   I'm not sure why I tried the free range chicken but it was as extremely dry with very little flavor.  Michael had some kind of steak but it looked frightening to me so I decided against trying it.   They were busy and maybe it was an off night. Not on my list of places to revisit.   For the price of this meal  I expected something wonderful. Palatable would also have been acceptable.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A friend visiting from out of town and I went to Olives for lunch. We were seated right away  but at a small table near the entrance. There were several other open tables  and people were eating outside  but we weren't asked our preference. I actually would have loved a fountain view and would have waited for it.  Oh well.  Service was overall prompt and attentive  and our waiter was very personable.  The beef carpaccio that my friend ordered was very good! My squid and octopus was a bit tough  but overall good.  I had the pink snapper special for my entree. I enjoyed the risotto  but the snapper was a bit underseasoned.  My friend ordered the short rib pasta and didn't care for it.  All in all  I was a bit underwhelmed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If I could I'd give Olives more then just 5 stars.  Their bread  appetizers  cocktails  salads  and entrees were to die for! Olive's was a great prelude to O which we caught that night (and is just a very short walk away).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"If I had to describe this experience in one word it would be ""WOW"". Chilean Sea Bass  out of this world  but what made me extremely pleased was Chris our waiter. Personable  attentive and on point.  Olive's welcomed me not as a visitor to it's city  but as a guest that was as though I was a regular. Recognized as someone that deserves the best treatment every time.  I look forward to coming back  and thanking the Chef personally for a 5 star meal."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My former fave spot to spend an evening with the fountains  a friend  and a bottle of wine was Fontana next door  but when they decided that place wasn't hip enough and needed some renovation  Mr. L and I tried Olives.   Now my 4*'s doesn't cover anything like entrees bc we didn't order them  but with our wine we got excellent bread and an olive plate  and left alone with our lovely view of the fountains. No pressure to eat or leave  no pressure to finish the wine and give the prime table back to more lucrative guests... Something that didn't go unappreciated.   Maybe next time I'll even try the food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The chicken artichoke flatbread was excellent. All the breads in the basket were to die for.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Dinner on Dec 28th  2014.  Ok  I was so disappointed. I truly expected more of this place. I had not eaten at any of Todd English's restaurants so i wanted to give it a try and lets just say it will take me a while before dining at another one of his places.  Service: staff was helpful and polite  not even once they let me open the door that goes to the patio  where you can see the fountains right in front of you  that was very courteous of them. Then our server was not bad but not the best. We ordered an appetizer right when we sat down and after that i had to say more than a couple of times (during the first mins) that i was not ready yet to order my entree  so i felt a little rushed there. On the other hand  i don't believe he was very knowledgeable about the menu. Don't get me wrong  he knew the names of course  but had several doubts and gaps about the cooking process and the ingredients. I know that might sound a little extreme but when Im paying $50 for a single plate I want to know all the details about it. (The prices are subject to change here  we went during holidays time). Food: our appetizer was the beef carpaccio. It arrived to the table in a matter of a few minutes. By the time we were already getting a taste of their focaccia bread and their complimentary tapenade (nice start). Carpaccio was 5/5. Thinly sliced  well seasoned  accompanied by greens  spoon bread  topped with shaved parmesan cheese and drizzled with a yummy reduction. Highly recommended. One more thing  good sharing size. (We were two  but we eat a lot too).   I ordered the gnocchi with pulled chicken. The pesto cream was delicious; it was of decent size  not too much chicken in it though. I thought the gnocchi was almost too soft; recalling the ones I had when i went to Italy these lacked some bite.  Up until here i liked my plate overall  then i bit into a couple of pine nuts that tasted old. It reminded me of a day when i found a little bag of them that i had misplaced  oh were they rancid. Well  i let that go; ate my gnocchi but would not rate it as a 5 stars plate.  We also had the pork chops. This was the main disappointment. They were hard  dry  spicy (not able to tell from the description in the menu). Nevertheless  it was on a bed of a very buttery polenta(5/5) and some sauteed collard greens. Something that caught my attention was how fast the pork chops arrived. Id say too fast  considering the time pork chops take to cook. That lead me to consider the possibility of the pork chops being previously cooked and then just ""heated?"" I did not say a word of this to my boyfriend for he was the one who ordered them and started eating them. Two bites after he told me the chops were very dry and tough. I told him that a pork chop is not the juiciest thing in the world but then i tried them. He does not know that much about cooking but he does know about eating. And yes  they were dry and tough indeed. A whole plate of dry  tough  spicy pork chops. He does not like spicy food but he combined it with the polenta and was able to finish it. We hate complaining at a restaurant  ( i had never done it before) and my bf always finishes his plates( idk  thats just something he has always done for some other reasons since he was a kid). After finishing our plates I asked the server how they cook the pork chops there  and i think he got nervous. And yes  they do not cook the pork chops to order. I told him they were a little tough and dry  he said he was going to let the manager know.  End of the meal  i don't know if he told the manager or not because nothing happened. No one passed by our table  no apologies... Just as if nothing had happened.  Oh and one more thing  it might not have nothing to with the food but lots to do with first impressions  i pointed two misspelled words (from the main menu) to the server. What a joke. That infuriates me  i cant resist misspelled words on prints. Id think at least 10 people'd go over the menu before printing it.  Well  im not going back.  Service: 2 Food: 3.5 ( because of that good carpaccio)  Overall: itd be a 2.5 because that service ahhhh takes away stars.  Try Robuchon at MGM"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Perfect dining experience!! Lovely restaurant &'atmosphere. Impeccable service & fabulous food!! I'll be back!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For a French person  the bread is simply horrible. But it might be a matter of taste. The linguine vongole are both the most expensive and the worst I ever had. Pasta was overcooked  very few clams  tasteless sauce. Waiters kept on bumping into my chair. First glass of champagne came from a bottle that was opened so long ago it wasn't sparkling anymore and I had to ask to replace it. There are plenty of other options in Vegas  and although the view here is nice (right next to the Bellagio fountains) the culinary experience was a total letdown.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,That place was always on my to eat list. Upon arrival friendly stuff greeted me and then Hiro quickly sat me at the table overlooking the Bellagio fountain - thank you so much.  My server Nelson and his assistant were on the top of their game providing outstanding service throughout the meal.  All dishes tasted amazing. Carpaccio was by far best I have ever tasted. The Caesar salad was made fresh and was so crisp and full of flavor. The pork chop was cooked to perfection and it was most tender piece of pork I have ever tasted. The gnocchi was out of this world. Chef Bradley all kudos to you for delivering phenomenal dishes that not only taste but look great. Thanks you so much team olives for making my Christmas dinner so special.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Like most of the outposts of famous restaurants in Las Vegas  Olives only shares the name in common with the real deal in Charlestown (Boston).  I've had several superb meals at Olive's in Charlestown  so my expectations were high  but man what a travesty.  Flatbread was undercooked (not crispy) and tomatoes were flavorless cardboard variety--not heirloom as advertised.  I ordered beef tenderloin (medium rare) it took forever and when it finally arrived it was overcooked and cold.  I don't mean warm  I mean COLD.  Waiter offered to ""warm it up"" for me.  Seriously  $55 and you are going to warm it up for me.  Didn't have time for a redux so I picked at my son's Gnocchi which was gummy/pasty and truly flavorless.  Tasted like a bad leftover    creation.  I just feel sorry for everyone who think they are getting the best of Todd English."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We came here while staying at bellagio and it was a great experience. We had limited time do we asked our waitress  Sabine  if there was anything we could get quickly. She suggested beef carpaccio and a prosciutto fig flatbread. We ordered both and crossed our fingers that it would arrive quickly. It took very little time to get oyt and we were amazed since it was pretty busy inside. Both dishes were delicious and we were happy that the waitress helped with our selections. We will definitely be coming back especially since we didn't get to enjoy our fountain view as we ate and ran.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Too heavy  too complicated.  Nice decor  but I felt the environment was Las Vegas formula  but without the extra important unique features to set it apart from other establishments.  I think its great for a beginner's ""let's go fancy one once"" kind of meal  but flat if you're a veteran to dining out."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Paul. Best server I've ever had. Ever. Made the whole experience wonderful for me and my coworkers. Food and drinks were good but Paul really made it great. We came here before the cirque du soleil show. Were promptly seated even with a group of 7 and served our drinks and appetizers. We were running late for the show so we asked if we could get the check taken care of quickly. Paul literally runs to the register to get it done... Not too fast though  don't want him to get in trouble! Anyways  all 7 of us had an absolutely wonderful time at this restaurant and I hope to come back soon!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Important note - we are both vegetarian.  I mention this because the focus is obviously on meat  which may be great  but any good restaurant can cook their veggies.  We go to four and five diamond restaurants often and are overall pretty easy.  While they were accomodating to us  what we got was a mediocre salad  a platter of roasted vegetables  and a veggie pasta.  These are the most obvious items  which unfortunately were only poorly executed.    The ambiance is beautiful  but very casual.    Great for kids - not the best for a romantic dinner.  It felt like a very high end Olive Garden to us.  Loud  many large tables  good decor - overall solid.  At the end of the day  I am more critical here because of how many amazing Vegas restaurants there are.  The convenience to shopping is wonderful  as well as the decor  but the creativity and overall execution was poor.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Sat at the bar for dinner  twice in our 4 day trip. Never had to bother with a reservation for 2 cause you are allowed wait around until a seat opens up. So basically you wait only 15 min. for 2 seats since most at the bar are waiting for their reservations. The chicken/watercress dish was very good  I chose it for both dinners. The Lolla Rosa salad was really nice and different. Their slingback  bellini and lemon drop were all very good and I was never cheated on the amount of liquor. I actually watched them pour drinks for least 4 hours and I don't know how it is even possible to have one with ""barely any liquor"" as some have previously stated. Anyway  will be back our next trip!  P.s. Agree with other comments on the hostess stand. The 3 standing up there were kind of blank faced or trying to ignore when I asked them if we could wait around bar while something opened up. They almost seemed to not care to answer. Definitely not polite."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food is really on point here and the view is spectacular of the Bellagio fountain! It was raining so we did not get to go sit on the balcony and be close to the Bellagio fountain. It was still a great scene outside bc of the rain mist. The food was well prepped. The salmon was perfectly cooked and seasoned. We had the tiramisu for dessert! It was delicious. There were layers of banana bread in the cake  which was a very unique twist. I would go back here again.  This is a perfect date spot  especially at night where the lighting is nicely lit and again  the view of the Bellagio fountains are magnificent! A true Las Vegas attraction in itself.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Bummed. Completely bummed. Well I decided to do my birthday dinner here. The location worked out great since we were going to go see O that night. We didn't have reservations because we were just winging it the few days we were there. We walked in and were seated right away with no reservations. So that was cool.  The service was horrendous. The server maybe came by our table a few times. We had to flag down the runners to request wine and additional drinks. We started out with the Portobello flat bread and boy o boy was that delicious. The mushroom and red onions were so good together. I can't wait to try that combo in a dish at home. Then I ordered the horrible entree  butternut squash tortelli. It was so disgusting. Bland  bland  bland! And to make it worse  my friend also ordered the same thing. Let's just say we really didn't eat dinner that night. Thank God my boyfriend ordered the Crazy Mushroom Pappardelle. I was able to pick at his meal throughout dinner and it was really good. They really know how to pick their shrooms! SO just a FOREWARNING to all my yelp friends!!! DO NOT GET THE BUTTERNUT SQUASH TORTELLI!!! So gross.  Also  make reservations ahead of time for the balcony. It looked amazing out there.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food  great service  wonderful wine selection  AMAZING ambiance.  If you can  sit on the patio overlooking the Fountains.  If you cannot  it's still nice to be able to walk out and see the water show at the Bellagio.  Highly recommend this place.  Make reservations.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I went to Las Vegas for a getaway recently and dined here on the recommendation of a friend.   The fresh bread was made in house and fantastic. Some was more of a cracker  some was more bread. All ready good.   I had two cocktails  first was forgettable but the second (mango something) was great.   Our fig and prosciutto flatbread appetizer was also just average -but- my sea scallops were the best either of us has ever had. My wife also loved her cheese ravioli.   Overall- skip the appetizers and go for the entrees.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ordered their octopus and was not pleased at all. Service was a bit slow side and given the lack of customers I did not understand why so slow
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Because of their restaurant policy  I give it two stars because of the bartender.   I came here to do the bar menu and have a few drinks for my BIRTHDAY..I thought the bar menu was from 4:00-6:00pm but it was 3:00-5:00pm. We had arrived at 4:15pm and ALL seats at the bar were taken but there were small tables next to the bar that were EMPTY.    I asked the host if we could sit at one of the small tables and he informed us that ALL tables are for DINNER ONLY and it starts at 5:00 pm. ( he wasn't the most friendly) Well there goes that plan. No one would be leaving the BAR and then the menu would be over. I have never heard of a restaurant that ONLY provides seats at the ""literal"" bar when they are serving their bar menu. Maybe they do things differently in CA.  Plan B: Go to the Bellagio fountain show..which was wonderful as they had the show to the tune Lady Luck by Frank Sinatra..ahh...classic Vegas..on the way back  we walked past OLives and I thought well I have to at least get a birthday drink and they had 2 seats open. The bartender poured well ..got our money's worth  not watered down like most restaurants ( that is why I make my own most of the time). Didn't have dinner  too expensive and needed a reservation though the seating was practically empty for the tables..went to see the Monet exhibit and get dessert elsewhere.."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My favorite restaurant in Vegas  and I've been to many.  The beef carpaccio is the best I've ever had.  Also love the flatbreads and pastas.  Great views of the Bellagio fountains or peoplewatch the passersby in the Bellagio mall.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was high time that I dined at Olives to test out the food of Cunard Line's celebrity chef Todd English  and Restaurant Week provided a good opportunity.  So  along with another couple  off we went to Bellagio.  Although the Restaurant Week menu was more like a sampler  it gave a good glimpse into what turned out to be fine food that well suited both foodies with sophisticated palates and unsophisticated comfort food.devotees.  A few delicate Oysters on the Half Shell with Lemon Wasabi Cream fell in the first category  and excellent tangy Olives Meatloaf with Truffle Ketchup and Smashed Potatoes the second.  Another intriguing combination entree was Cast Iron Trout sprinkled with Toasted Almonds lying atop a mound of well-prepared Lemony Crab Risotto.       Before delving into entrees  a small tray of Green Olive Tapenade accompanied by nicely marinated Green Olives paired well with Black Olive Tapenade nestled next to marinated Black Olives; and a Charcuterie Board featured a few well cured meats and cheese selections.  But for me  delightful Chocolate Rolls were the highlight of the meal.  I consumed four all by myself!  Then excellent moist Banana Tiramisu closed out a fine meal.  Servers were omnipresent and anxious to accommodate diners' needs  and management was accommodating.  4-1/2 stars overall  and I am now ready to sign up for a renowned Cunard transatlantic crossing on the high seas between Southampton and New York.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It has been some time since I've been here. Went here with my boss and a colleague. We were seated immediately  but the couple who approached the podium ahead of us was turned away by the hostess who claimed all the tables were reserved and were no available seats at the bar. This was very questionable.   The food was fine  the decor pleasant. It was unfortunate that the hostess set the mood of pretentiousness and slightly soured the evening.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The carpaccio and mushroom risotto are to die for.  The lobster fettuccine was light and tasty and ricotta the ravioli had great flavor. Large portions and you could easily share. Large wine list.  It is very loud and while I normally love a good people watching session if you sit inside you do have the view of the tourists staring at you while you dine.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is beautiful!  No wonder there is always a line every time I walk by!  Service = Good nothing spectacular Ambiance = the decor is beautiful  but that's sort of Vegas! Food = tasteful but not amazing  go with Scallop!   Price = $$$$ Crowd = Impressive feel  with good blend  love the Vegas crowd  everyone is just out to enjoy life! Personal Favorite = ambiance and crowd Worst = Expected a bit more from a celebrity chef My meal for two = $140 Final Say = Drinks at the bar with appetizer should suffice!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was so excited about eating here. Service was  great  friendly  funny waiter. Husband got the scallops with beets said it was great. I ordered the gnocchi with chicken. Chicken was dry and food was not to hot. Wound up feeling sick for the rest of the evening. I was so disappointed. Gave 3 stars for ambiance and service. My food was mediocre.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,How did we get so lucky to get the perfect table outside on the patio  directly in front of the fountains?   We noshed on short rib-overwhelmingly decadent  Fig and prosciutto flat bread-ahmazing! Chicken gnocchi-delicious. Banana tiramisu-yum.  Bread basket..lavash  chocolate and walnut bread-it will put you in a carb induced coma.   The service was good  prompt without leaving you feeling rushed. If you want to get a great view of the fountains without having to elbow your way through and want to have a finer dining experience than the casino buffet  Olives would be a great place to check out.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It's a good lunch place for business meetings or dates. If you are lucky  you can sit out on the patio for an awesome view of the fountains. The interior decor is hip and contemporary with some booth seatings.   Unfortunately  the food is quite disappointing. For starter  the beef carpaccio was unappetizing and the presentation was too. There's mushy beef on top of salad and polenta. It was a bit gross with a huge portion too. The mussels capellini dish was alright  but it was nothing special. The mussels were fresh though. The lunch beef sirloin is quite big  but the edges taste a bit burnt. The meat was chewy and tasted gamey.   Overall  come for the potential of patio view and nice decor. The food is average at best especially for Vegas standards at top hotels.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,GREAT FOOD!  The service was less than great.  I had to wait a long time before my water glass was refilled.    I tried the slow cooked... 6 hr braised short ribs.  It was ONE of the MOST AMAZING things I've ever tasted.  Very tender meat  good spices... so good.  The restaurant also serves GREAT  TASTY bread that comes with 2 types of olive tapenades and olives.  I am not a big fan of olives so I didn't really enjoy the tapenades as much.  They have a cool drinks menu.  The ambiance inside is dark and quite elegant.    I'd definitely go back for the short ribs.  My friends tried the porterhouse.. IT was a large steak.. covered mostly by fried green beans.  They said that it was very tasty.  I really wanted to try some of the fish dishes too but it's quite expensive here.    I was tooooo full after dinner to eat dessert so I better not eat so much bread next time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,i really wanted the buffet at the belliggo but my billionaire japanese cousin wanted to take myself and some other japanese buyers to a really nice lunch before our massages  so we were on a tight schedule and the waiter was really nice and cool about that but everything was wrong and it was horrible to say the least. First my cousin isn't eating cheese at the moment and ordered for all of us and im not sure what came out but it looked like udon noodles with tomato sauce and his dish had massive cheese on it but they said it didn't and i didn't dare to complain then while in the middle of the crowded resturaunt so he ate it and i know it was good cus he loves cheese! Anyways it was a 400 plus lunch took 45 mins and i had to laugh when i saw one of our guest buyers just moving his udon noodle around his plate but the decor is awesome i loved the lights above the inside tables....xoxo   maybe if i go next time it will be better!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I went here with my mom (who hadn't been to Vegas in 25 years...YIKES) and a best friend from Dallas who just happened to be in town for business.  It was a special night  all three of us together in this crazy city  and I wanted dinner to be special.  So I asked a bunch of friends where we should go for and early-ish dinner on a Tuesday. I didn't want anything off-the-charts fancy  i.e.  something you had to super dress up for or that would send us in to the poor house. But I DID want something memorable and lovely. The winning recommendation was Olives.  Wow.  First of all  we got seated right by the window overlooking the famous Bellagio ""lake"" and fountains. Granted it was too early for the dancing waters  but still  it was nice.  We each started with cocktails. They were all excellently prepared and generous. My dirty Grey Goose martini with stuffed bleu cheese olives was insanely good. I tried to look up my friend's order online  but can't find the cocktial menu. But it was a grapefruit-based martini that looked refreshing and she said it was yummy.  My friend and I both started with the Bibb Lettuce Salad. Sometimes  simple salads are the best. And this was one of those times. A very generous serving of in-season  super-fresh  tasty bibb lettuce  lightly dressed with a lemony vinagrette and some shaved onions and chopped walnuts. Perfect.   Then the entrees arrived.  We all ordered seafood.  Mom: the salmon.  Friend: the sea bass.  Me: the swordfish.  Okay  I can only directly comment on my own entree because we were all scarfing our stuff so crazily we didn't manage to share. But I will say that they reported their entrees were most excellent. And judging by their empty plates  I believe them.  The swordfish: Day-um. I don't eat red meat  so when I go out  I usually order a good ""meaty"" cut of fish for my entree...tuna  swordfish  etc. I have never  EVER  had swordfish this tasty before. It was broiled with crushed almonds on top  and served on top of seasoned mashed red bliss potatoes and wilted greens. Seriously? My mouth is watering just writing this...and I just ate dinner  people!!  I WILL go here next time in Vegas. Nice atmosphere (if a bit loud  but so are a lot of the better restaurants in Las Vegas). Excellent  attentive (but not overly intrusive) service. Five freakin' stars!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My first visit to Las Vegas was almost like a culture shock. I highly enjoyed my stay here and the first place I stopped to grab something to eat was Olives. My boyfriend has gone here before and wanted me to try it out. Our server was very friendly  but he disappeared every now and then. I didn't hold it against him because it was really packed that day.  PAN SEARED ATLANTIC SALMON- wild rice  sauteed asparagus  cognac beurre blanc  and micro insalata This dish was flavorful and fresh. I liked the sear on the salmon  it added a nice crisp and sweetness to the fish and the beurre blanc was very savory and creamy. The wild rice was a bit plain. It tasted bland. When eaten with the salmon  it was okay  but I only wish for it to have a little more flavor.  STEAK FRITES- grilled flat iron  tuscan fries  port glaze  and frisee greens This dish wasn't all that great. The steak was a bit dry and tough. The port glaze was the best thing about this dish  but there was only a little spread on the plate. I really liked the greens because it added a nice refreshing earthy taste to the steak. The fries could've been seasoned better because they just tasted like regular potatoes.  BANANA TIRAMISU- banana mascarpone cream  banana cake  chocolate sauce  and kahlua sabayon This was the best dish during the whole dining experience. I have an obsession with tiramisu and have never tried a banana tiramisu. It was divine! It was so creamy and moist. I could really taste the bananas  but they weren't overwhelming. You could still taste the tiramisu and the liqueur. It felt so light; yet so rich with flavor.  Olives really provided a nice view of the Bellagio fountain and you could see the other casinos on the strip. I would come here again if I came back to Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overdue review because finally tried this place with mom and aunts last year because we wanted to enjoy the Bellagio Fountains while dining.  Made reservations for the patio and the VIEW was spectacular!   Bread Basket with olives and olive tapenade was deelish especially the white chocolate bread!!!  Dishes ordered: Butternut Squash Pasta  Lobster Pasta  and Bass (I think)... we all shared and all of it was deelish!  Desserts: Mango Brulee and Hazelnut Souffle and OMG both were too die for!!! Especially the Hazelnut Souffle!!!  Also  since my mom's birthday the server brought out 3 different kinds of truffles and they were FANTASTIC!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My family had lunch here on Christmas Day (we chose it because it was one of the few well-reviewed sit down restaurants on the strip that had entrees in the $20s).  I also appreciated that they did not have a fancy Christmas prix fixe and instead had the normal menu with normal prices.  However  I do think its a little overpriced for the quality of food  even at lunch (pastas are $20-$25  sandwiches are $17-$22 and entrees are mostly in the upper $20s and low $30s at lunch).  For those prices  I expect both great food and a great ambiance and the food left me wanting a little bit.  They start you off with a great bread basket that has three types of bread (ciabatta  foccacia and a cheese cracker) with several olive spreads (butter was also provided on request for no charge).   For our meals  my husband had the burger  my father had the steak sandwich  my mother had the salmon with rice and asparagus and I had the scallops with proscuitto (I requested the proscuitto on the side because I don't eat it but my husband wanted to).  There was some confusion with the entrees. They brought out my mom's and husband's entrees first (although they incorrectly described my mom's dish as the trout  leading to some confusion) and then they brought my dad a steak frites  which was not what he ordered  so they took it back.  My entree was delayed too  but for no apparent reason.  Finally the brought my scallops and my dad's steak sandwich.    One of my 3 scallops had proscuitto on it  even though I had requested it on the side.  I did not care very much for the scallops.  They were gritty and had a stringy texture.  They came with brussels sprouts which were seriously undercooked.  I did like the risotto they were served over  although it was supposedly truffle and I didn't get that flavor.  (I also think 3 small scallops is a fairly stingy portion but it was ok because I didn't really like it).  My husband was also not too impressed with his burger  which was $17.  My parents liked their food and I had some of my mom's salmon and thought it was very tasty.  Although this place is borderline worth it for lunch  it is definitely not for dinner.   They accidentally gave me a dinner menu and my scallops (which were $29 at lunch) would have been $42 at dinner.  No thank you!  I would not want to pay Michelin star prices for poorly cooked  gritty scallops and flustered service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Used to go to Olives growing up in Boston  I haven't been to one in many years. We stopped by for a late (10pm) light dinner. They have some great salads and flatbreads. The bartender served us food and drink and was very attentive  friendly  and helpful. I would come back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Before I start let me preface by saying all my ratings are RELATIVE to the price.  If I'm paying $80 per person I will only give it 5 star if it outperforms other similarly priced joints.  I think that's much more useful for people browsing the site for advice.  I've been to lots and lots of Michelin star-ed places so I know the kind of quality you can get for these ""high"" prices.    So after being disappointed by Bouchon @ Venetian the night before its on to the next one ... Olives @ Bellagio.  I went there based on the rare 4 star average Yelp rating.  First impression wise both the decor and service are not Michelin star worthy while the prices are.  Not surprising that this restaurant hasn't seen a star yet.  Like this it never will.  The bread was brought out with some olives and two types of spread that are given lots of props by reviews on Yelp.  The bread was good  but again not spectacular.  Some pieces were too salty.  The spreads are NOTHING to rave about.  We can all go to the grocery store and buy the exact same spreads on the cheap.  Not impressed in the least..  I rather have higher end bread with nice butter.  Better bread for example can be found @ Spago's in LA.  It was also much better @ Bouchon.  We started out with the Kobe Beef Tartare.  This was solid though I've had better meat tartare in other places.  For example the Lamb based one @ Gilt in NY is top notch.  If nobody told me it was Kobe I would have never noticed.  Then came the Calamari that was recommended by the waiter.  Let me say this clearly ... DO NOT GET THIS.  The calamari are too heavily battered and both the batter and the sauce are VERY salty.  I asked the waiter and he said it is *a little* on the salty side.  As I ate the stuff with my girlfriend we concluded that it tastes exactly like ... marinated olives.  Horrible.  It was on a bed of arugula which I enjoyed.  But in general it actually made me a bit sick.  For entrees I got a mushroom fettuccine and my girlfriend got the Chilean seabass.    The fettuccine was a HUGE portion.  Just unnecessary.  I enjoyed the dish but for the price it doesn't cut it.  The sauce was too thin and the pasta was clearly slightly overcooked.  Again no Michelin stars here.  The Chilean was also enjoyable but not price worthy.  I can get a much better plate in LA for about 1/3 less.  Then since it was getting late we got moved to the patio for coffee and a tiramisu.  The coffee was fine.  Didn't stand out but it never does in America.  Maybe in Paris or in Italy.  The tiramisu was low grade  but I didn't care because it is SO nice at the patio.  Watching the water shows is a great experience.  My advice here is go somewhere else.  I haven't found THE stop in Las Vegas yet but I'm still hunting so watch my future reviews.  If you do want to go here then INSIST on sitting on the patio.  Just wait however long is necessary.  It is worth it.  I'll be @ Picasso (2 Michelin stars) later in the week and I'll definitely wait for a patio table."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives in the Bellagio is down right amazing. The ambiance  food  and service is tremendous. Although being with my beautiful wife made it better.  Ask for John the waiter. Doesn't rush you and is great at what he does.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow!   Great food  service and ambience.  I requested a special table with a fountain view since I was bringing some clients for dinner.  The hooked us up with a semi private table with an amazing view of the fountains. My favorite spot for a great evening in Vegas!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had lunch at Olives.  It was really nice outside  65 and sunny and we walked in around 12 and there were several open tables on the patio.  We were seated promptly  however  our server was a little off.   They serve olives  green olive and garlic tapenade  and kalamata olive tapenade with crisps and delicious bread as an amuse bouche...all are delicious.    For lunch we ordered a flat bread  the Bronx Bomber as an appetizer  and for entrees  B had a burger and I had the Crispy Tuna Salad.  Both were good  not amazing  but good.  My salad could definitely have used some salt.  There was a great amount of tuna...but there really weren't any standout flavors.  What made this meal was the weather  the view of the strip and the fountains.  All made it an excellent meal and a memorable experience.  It was serene and tranquil.  Strange that when we left  the patio was nearly empty and the inside of the restaurant was PACKED.    Good restaurant with a great view.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,As everyone has said and I agree: the beef carpacchio is amazing.  My girlfriends and I went here for lunch  and we made reservations and were seated immediately. They brought us a basket of crackers and breads with olive dip and olives to nibble on. The service was great throughout.  We ordered appetizers to share: beef carpacchio (DELICIOUS)  shrimp and chorizo flatbread (has a spicy kick to it but really flavorful)  five onion soup (wasn't memorable)  and a salad.  What I liked most was the ambiance and service. Since we shared appetizers and starters  the bill wasn't bad at all and we were very pleased and satisfied with our meal before we headed out to shop and enjoy the rest of Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food and drinks.  They even made a chocolate espresso martini for me that was not on the menu.  Highlight includes beef carpaccio appetizer.  Well worth the price. Only downside is the restaurant is very dark which makes reading the menu difficult.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Unremarkable lunch. Nothing on the menu screams for me to try.  ** Tuna carpaccio: pretty good size and tasted fresh. ** Grilled scallops over mushroom risotto: salty  salty  salty. They must've sprinkled salt over the greens too. Three small scallops = $25ish.  ** Burger: a bit dry.  ** Lamb chops: asked for medium and they came bloody. A tad sweet  a little gamey. ** Rotisserie chicken: a tad salty  a bit dry.  Service was off and on...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good Day A week before Christmas we arrived in Las Vegas.  Visiting our daughter who lives in the area. Truly memorable   great food   excellent service and the fountain show was so sweet. Christmas songs  great food   wonderful ambience.  Will definitely be back .
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Yes yes yes  I love Olives  I love Todd English  I loved everything! Maybe it was view  maybe it was the food  maybe it was the company  but my party and I started out here before heading out into the night and it was THE perfect way to begin our evening. Having eaten here before in the Bahamas and loving it  I knew this place would not disappoint. Olives is Todd English's take on modern Italian favorites that focus on a more expansive mediterranean forte.   First off  can we talk about the bread and tapenade? Holy olive oil Batman  oh my goodness is that stuff addicting  I think we ordered 4 or more refills for my party of 4  I could have just snacked on that all night...but I was indulging my whole meal.  For apps I highly recommend the beef carpaccio: gorgonzola polenta  parmesan  cipollini onions  balsamic reduction  scallion cream  garlic aioli. What a pretty dish to look at as well as eat  I think it was on our table for no longer than 60 seconds until it was just an empty plate. According to the server  it was there most popular appetizer  and I can see why  GET IT!  Feeling pasta  I ordered the ricotta ravioli for the win knowing it would please. It was a generous helping topped with roasted tomato basil sauce  sweet italian sausage  and garlic bread crumbs...delicious. The other menu item that caught my eye was the butternut squash tortellini which was made with brown butter  amaretto cookies  sage  and parmesan cheese. Luckily my friend ordered it and I got to try some and man was that just as good  but be forewarned  it is a more sweet dominated dish in regards to flavor  think sweet and savory like a sweet potato  but nonetheless great.   Todd English does it right  from the service  to the atmosphere  to the all important food and Olives is no exception  come here for a great dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice place. Good food. Portions are big enough to share. We ordered 1 salad and 2 appetizers for 2people
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate here last night.  It was quite crowded but we got seat at the bar and had dinner there.   Great service at the bar!  Drinks were fantastic--and they have quite a variety of mixed drinks  wine  etc.  We had a special menu set up forRrestaurant Week that included three courses for $51.    Appetizer was pork ribs with sweet glaze over corn relish.  Pork was a bit dry  but tasty.  Main course was steak with cauliflour and mashed potatoes.  Good comfort food.  Nothing outstanding.  Dessert was chocolate cake with ice cream and glazed bananas.  Quite good.  Overall great service  great drinks  good food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We went to Olives on a weekend getaway for their famous Stoli Doli martinis.  AMAZING.  Jessica at the bar is awesome.  She even reshook our martinis after a bit to chill them again.  Best bartender  smile and service we had in all of Las Vegas was Jessica. She makes us feel welcome and has a great energy.  We look forward to seeing her at the restaurant knowing she will give us fantastic service and the best cocktail in Las Vegas!   The tapenade  cracker bread and carpaccio are excellent.  The Stoli Doli martinis are out of this world - ice cold pineapple-infused vodka.   Thank you  Jessica.  We will definitely make a point to see you on our next Vegas adventure!  Melissa and Claire
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I came here for dinner during our vacation. We had a reservation  which is essential. We asked for a table outside but initially were told there was an hour wait. We were seated near a window. When we spotted an open table outside and inquired again  the hostess happily rechecked availability- and then it was ours! I highly recommend an outdoor table. We got to watch the water show multiple times. The ambiance could not have been better. Plus  the food was excellent. I couldn't decide between 2 pastas (squash ravioli and sausage) and the waitress told me I could have half and half of each (a secret not on the menu). It was delicious. My boyfriend got the pork chop  which was also delicious! (Check out pics I posted). Our waitress was lovely. Overall  it was perfect dining experience :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was treated to an awesome dinner here last night.  The service was outstanding and the food was incredibly delicious!  Before the server took our order  we were given a basket of yummy sweet bread with olive spread.  I couldn't get enough of the olive spread  it was so friggin good!!!  I had Butter Squash Tortellini as the main course...but before that  we had an appetizer  flat bread with Portabella  Mushrooms on the bread very tasty! While we enjoyed our dinner  I was able to see a tiny view of the fountains putting on their show!! This place would be an awesome place if you want to impress your date or anyone for that matter!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is by far our favorite restaurant in Vegas  especially for lunch. The outdoor eating area overlooks the water show so if it's not too hot out  request a seat out there. The inside is lovely (decor). The last time we went  we had our 2 year old son with us (who is like a hurricane) and the servers there were all wonderful  despite him. Make sure to get the fig/prosciutto flat bread. It is amazing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I went with my sister and two friends; my sister and one of the friends had been to Olives before for lunch.  We ordered two appetizers and four entrees.  Yeah  too much food!  One entree came cold but the server took it and brought a fresh  hot entree for her and we got dessert free!  Unfortunately  two people had to leave early for a show and the other two were too full  but we got the Meyer Lemon Tarts.  They were light and very cleansing.    Oh  and our server Ralph ROCKED!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a 5.30 reservation and wanted to sit outside we were greeted nicely by the host and were brought outside to our tale but it was really warm and we asked to sit inside no problem.We had a nice table by the window our server Michelle was very friendly and professional.Dinner was fantastic but the high light was the beef carpaccio .Desserts were good to.Will defiantly return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I'd always wanted to see the Bellagio water fountain show while dining al fresco  and I was able to do this at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris. But if you have the chance  definitely go to one of Bellagio's restaurants on the lake because your experience will be 10x better.  With OpenTable reservations  we came by for drinks  appetizers  and desserts after lunching at Pho Kim Long in Chinatown. We actually arrived 45-minutes past our reservation time  but I'd called in advance to let them know we were stuck in traffic on the strip and subsequently had a hard time finding the restaurant. FYI  Olives is located in Bellagio's shopping area  near Louis Vuitton and Dior.  For a table out in the patio (requested with my reservation)  we waited an additional 10-minutes. The patio is a lot smaller than I envisioned and the promotional photos online definitely made it look much larger. Regardless  you still get a great view and seeing the fountain show every few minutes was cool.  Complimentary bread is served with olive sauces that I didn't particularly like. We ordered Truffle Fries ($9)  Banana Tiramisu  wine  and beer  which came to $50 incl. tax. The fries were served with ketchup  which wasn't ideal. Everyone knows truffle tastes better with garlic aioli... And if you like thin crispy fries  as I do  you probably shouldn't get these 'cause they were more like potato wedges. The tiramisu was amazingly light and delicious; I love bananas and all the textures of the lady fingers  cream  chocolate  and fruit made it one of the best tiramisus I've ever had the pleasure of eating.  I'm unsure if I'd come back to have lunch or dinner as it's pricey and I'd rather spend that money towards something else (like dinner at Picasso on the other side of the lake); but I will definitely be back for drinks and desserts the next time I'm in town.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really enjoyed my experience here.  Came in for lunch.  Had the butter squash ravioli...probably one of the best ravioli I had.  The only missing star is the bread and spread came after our meals were served.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Unfortunately  I have to deduct stars from my previous review. Trust me  it's painful to do because I enjoy dining at this restaurant  but the lackluster service was a turnoff  especially taking into consideration that I came here with friends for my birthday dinner.  Service - I called the restaurant twice to make and confirm my reservation  and twice I was put on hold for over 10 minutes -- I kid you not. On top of that  the receptionists were snooty both on the phone and in person. Wait service didn't go above and beyond like in the past. Essentially  we received ""just get the job done"" kind of service.   Food - Delectable is a perfect word to describe our entrees. All of my friends enjoyed their orders  as well as the foie gras appetizer  which I praised in a previous review.  Crazy Mushroom P: I can't recall the full name of this pasta dish  but it's crazy good. The dish has peas and mushrooms mixed into creamy pasta. It's truly mouthwatering. Being a fast eater  this forced me to slow down and savor each bite.  Restaurant Layout: Dining here during a busy Saturday evening has made it apparent to me that this restaurant isn't an intimate dining spot. Tables are closely arranged together. Maneuvering through the sea of seats is like having to go through a Double Dare obstacle course. Plus  it's noisy  which makes it difficult to carry on a dinner conversation.   Overall - As much as I like this restaurant  I won't be returning for a very long time. Instead  I'll be visiting their competition where I can expect exceptional food AND exceptional service.   Rating: 3.5"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Business dinner with one of our vendors. This place was highly recommended and did not disappoint. The only drawback was it was really loud in the restaurant so conversations at a big table was difficult. The food was fantastic!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Prob my fave place to brunch/lunch on the strip.   Between 5 girls and 3 bottles of Cakebread's buttery chard  we shared several items which the waiter recommended:  -Beef Carpaccio -Tuna tartare -Lobster bolognese -Rib eye w. a red wine reduction -Fig and prosciutto flatbread we also got a couple items incl this smoked salmon dish (my fave  forgot name) and bread basket with Tapenade (best Tapenade ever).  Yumsicles - hope to visit again soon.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Tried to make reservations here about a week early and there weren't any available. We were able to secure reservations through our concierge and had to wait for a bit to get a table with a decent view  but were able to score one and got to see the fountains from our dinner table. Super romantic and worth the wait and difficulty getting reservations.  Food-  The bread came with different types olives (go figure!) and 2 olive spreads. OMG  amazing. I would probably go back for just this!  I ordered the seafood risotto...which was fantastic and perfectly cooked.  We got the cremw brulee for dessert....it was delicious but I was too full at this point to really enjoy it.   Excellent service.  The only thing that would deter me from returning is difficulty of getting a reservation as well as the expensiveness. While the food is good  I'm not sure it's worth the pric
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Confused that the Yelp listing is not Todd English's Olives  as the restaurant signage  menu  and promotional materials state. I guess Todd himself dined here and had an experience similar to mine  and didn't want his name associated with the place.  The food ranged from tasty cheese on the charcuterie board and surprisingly good espresso martinis  to average/mediocre everything else- and we ordered a lot. Tables are initially served a breadbasket with three mismatched breads  and a tray of olives and two tapenades- the green is best.  CHARCUTERIE BOARD: two types of tasty cheeses (one was a blue)  two types of meat (salami and prosciutto?)  dates  candied walnuts  and crisps. Wish I could tell you what type of cheese it was  but all dishes were presented without any sort of explanation or comment. FOIE GRAS: served with fresh fig (singular)  port reduction (gross)  and truffle crema (tastless  certainly no truffle here). Served without any sort of crackers or bread  and our breadbasket was empty and no one ever refilled it.  Did not care for the texture  flavors seemed off. Would have shared this with my server  but we never saw him.  BRICK OVEN ROASTED FREE RANGE CHICKEN: served with a potato cake and green means  all amid a sea of tasty jus  but the chicken itself was bland. Recurring issue with dishes here. Again  even just salt would have helped this dish. BONE-IN NY STRIP SPECIAL: served with green beans and fingerling potatoes  steak was plated with a giant puddle of some sort of cabernet sauce? Guess it was meant to hide the fact that the meat was flavorless aside from gobs of fat in every bite  and unseasoned to the point that it desperately needed salt. No char or sear at all.   MUSHROOM RISOTTO: decent-ish side  mediocre version of a favorite dish. The table ate the entire portion though. CRISPY ZUCCHINI: no menu description  expected a roasted version but received a plate of tempura zuke covered with cheese. Hard not to like that but odd considering the rest of the menu.   As you can see  we had issues with the service. The restaurant wasn't that busy  yet we rarely saw our server. Literally went 20 minutes wanting a martini that I couldn't order because he never came by. When he did  he didn't seem to care at all. We were asked what we wanted to drink  what we wanted to order  and if we had any questions- no intro  no script  no explanation of specials  devoid of personality. Didn't even ask to see a dessert menu because we were so put off by the flavorless food and nonexistent service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you are lost in the dazzling halls of the Bellagio and can't find this restaurant  just follow your nose.  It literally accosts your senses with the odor of olives before you even enter!  I shared a portabella flatbread over a glass of chenin blanc at lunch and enjoyed the stellar experience from beginning to end.  The server was very attentive  the olive paste and table bread is a nice departure from the norm  and the ambience  looking out over the Bellagio fountains  can't be bested.  I would definitely re-visit the next time I'm in town.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was amazing  food was divine  ambiance was welcoming and refined  but not standoffish.  The bread and tapenade was heavenly! I LOVE olives. My mouth waters just thinking about their tapenade! We got the fig and prosciutto flatbread pizza as an appetizer. I am obsessed with the sweet/salty crispy/gooey creamy/acidic balance that this offered. It was perfect! The best part was trying to get the perfect bite and succeeding every time because all the ingredients were portioned and spread out so perfectly. So well thought out. I definitely appreciated this.  We got the lunch special fried scallops and Hawaiian seared ahi tuna  both equally delicious and very well balanced. Not too heavy  not too light. Just right. To top it off  Olives offers a service tab so you can bill your check to your room regardless of which hotel you're staying at. Awesome!   All charged up to go shopping :D!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was good  but the service was TERRIBLE!!! I was brought a wrong drink and my husband's drink never arrived. The waiter never checked in with us. When I finally pointed out to him that my rose champaign somehow got substituted by a rose wine  he offered to fix a mistake  but never did. Had my husband not checked with another waiter on the status of his mojjito  it would have never arrived. The entire experience was on a C- level. Spend tour money at other restaurants and stay away from Todd English's Olives.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"The cat's meow.  Sexy.  I've been four times.  AMAZING!!!  Expensive   but worth it.  LOVE the flat breads.  There is one with Figs and Prosciutto...thin warm bread with the sweetness of the figs and salt of the prosciutto...Mmmph!  Wash it down with a Sauvignon Blanc or a Cakebread Chardonnay and you're lovin life. Watch the ""Oh Face"" your dining mate makes when that combination hits their pallet"".  The outdoor seating is tough to get  but if you get there for an early dinner  you may score an outdoor seat.  Drink wine  have a flat bread for an appy...take your time.  If you seat at 5  eat and drink and wait to order dinner around 6 eat dinner and get out around 7:30 in time for the 8 PM showing of ""O"".  That's the way I rolled...  Very romantic...unless it's windy.  You may get wet from the fountains.  You did know that the outdoor seating overlooks the Bellagio Fountains  right?  Chow!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was looking forward to eating at Olives.  It always looked so busy  and it has a prime location.  But other than very nice ambiance and a decent Caesar salad  that's essentially all the positive things I can possibly say about Olives.  I ordered the rib eye medium rare  it arrived medium rare and had no flavor whatsoever.  My friend ordered the NY steak medium  it arrived almost well-done and had no flavor.    The sides we ordered -- mac n cheese and mushroom risotto -- arrived almost 10 minutes after the entrees arrived.  In fact  they arrived after we returned the entrees!  But that was just the start.  The mushroom risotto isn't a mushroom risotto.  It's actually a mushroom porridge.  The consistency was all wrong.  And it looked disgusting.  But it had great flavor.  The mac n cheese arrived as 2 triangles.  It was more a mac n cheese cake.  I've had friend mac n cheese at other places before  but this was odd.  And even with the truffles  the flavor just didn't do it any favors.  The 2nd entrees arrived -- the NY Steak was still almost well done.  THe ribeye was better flavored on one side  and simply over salty on the other side of the steak  so salty that I just decided to skip the other half of the steak.  We were incredibly frustrated with the dinner  at this point  but curiosity got the better of me.  Just how badly could this restaurant make dessert??  We ordered the S'mores panna cotta.  It was a pretty good dessert  but it was nothing to really write home about.  I had kicked around the idea of the chocolate souffle  but I would have been tempting fate.  A *real* restaurant would have suggested if we were interested in the chocolate souffle  that we should put the order in prior to ordering the meal.  That being said  the staff was friendly.  The manager did check in on us after the 2nd entree arrive  and after discovering that one of the entrees was still not done properly  we were comped the price of that entree.   For almost $300  including the price of a bottle of Duckhorn  there are far better restaurants in Las Vegas -- even some with great views too.  Don't bother with this place  Besides  Bellagio is shutting Olives down in 2014.  And it can't come soon enough.   Anyone with a half decent palate shouldn't bother with this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,First off  if you got the balcony seating  the view to the Bellagio fountain is spectacular. That was what I got and wow  was that fun!!  Unfortunately  food was so so. Actually  it was worse than so so. The tuna tartare was fine but had a hard time finishing it as it was quite oily. The squid was fine but on the softer side and had a little off texture. The handmade pasta were mushy and waayy too soft. I didn't enjoy eating it. I had the fettuccine carbonara with crab. Not good.  The signature dessert was chocolate lava cake. It was okay but lava cake is ordinary. Standard at best. Todd English's restaurant..mind you. But whatever. It doesn't mean much at times even if a famous chef's name attached to it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We sat the bar on Saturday for lunch  and wow was it great!  The bartender Curtis was awesome and friendly.  I really great guy who knows alot about Vegas.  I love sitting at the bars if you have a bartender with great attitude and personality.  There was another couple from Ohio sitting next to us as well  and we had awesome time sampling drinks and starting our day out right.    For food  I had the sea scallops  which were delicious.   Perfect light lunch choice that was filling  tasted great  but not so heavy you want to lay down afterwards!     I forgot the name of my drinks  but they were excellent. They have a great selection of different cocktails that you can view on a tablet menu.       I've stayed at Bellagio six times now  and this was my first visit to Olives.  I will be back now for sure!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Awwww Yelper's! Ya'll are letting me down! I'm sad to say that I was disappointed in the food here but the drinks here were SUPERB.  For the price of dinner  I felt that Olives really could have done better. I had the rib-eye which was yummy but totally didn't understand the potato chip garnish  really??  Secondly  the mushroom risotto is not mushroom risotto but mushroom FLAVORED extra watery rice  I was not a fan.  The servers  drinks  and location are fabulous which is what lead me to my four star review.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Awesome is too tame to explain my experience at this culinary wonder. A modest  simple atmosphere in a casino/mall like environment that surpassed my foodie dreams with attentive waiter service  delicious liquid refreshments and dishes to die for......I started with the Grilled Squid & Octopus vinaigrette of chickpeas  tomatoes  toasted garlic  parsley which had pleasant smokey taste. Followed by an earth shattering culinary wonder of Pan Seared Stripe Bass summer vegetable risotto  buttered broccolini  charred radicchio  balsamic vinaigrette. And during all of this amazing impromptu dinner with friends while in Vegas I washed dinner down with delightful pomegranate wonderment (I'll have to call them for the ingredients).   Followed by my other love in life chocolate from Jean Philippe Patisserie....what can I say it was a Bellagio evening.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Short story: The dishes were delicious  the service was stellar  and the ambiance was warm & elegant. A four star restaurant in every aspect except for their inability to handle off the menu dishes. At close to $40 a plate  I think there should be some culinary expertise outside of the scripted menu. So I deducted a star for that.  Longer version; I had the Scallops with mushroom risotto with the crispy brussels sprouts on the side. Both were delicious & perfectly seasoned. They did not mention the parmigiano cheese on the sprouts until it was presented at the table. Not a big issue but I would have asked for salt or anchovie instead had I known. One of my companions is vegan. Our waiter John was very receptive. Letting her know which dishes to avoid and why. He came early to aprise her of the bread serving & warn her about the anchovies in the tapenade. She ordered a vegetable platter which had to be made to order) and the beet salad. (Delicious  & again very well seasoned). But was surprised when her vegetable order arrived. There was no culinary finesse. No seasoning just overly steamed vegetables. Perhaps   the kitchen is not creatively inclined outside of the set menu or maybe (& more likely) they were having an off night. This was my second visit  here but she had been many  many times and was flabbergasted by the dish.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"being that todd english is one of the original iron chefs america  i had high expectations. too bad i was sorely let down. the appetizers were fine  but for my entree i had a terrible lamb shank. the meat was very gamey and i couldn't help but feel that i was chewing on a wet stinky old gym sock. the texture was like a sock too!  the service was very slow. the wait staff were very insensitive to our needs. we were in a bit of a rush as we were trying to make it to our show. but after eternities of waiting between courses  we still ended up short on time. therefore  we had to skip my favorite part of the meal - dessert.  so we got the hefty bill...and trust me  it was not worth it at all. i would have gladly put that money to playing roullette...even if i put it all on one number  it's got better odds of ""winning"" than todd english's olives."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Made a reservation for 7:15 and requested balcony seating. Arrived and lady was pretty dismissive saying they sat all seats outside and it would be over an hour before one opens up  then turned and walked away before we can finish speaking to her.    The wait doesnt really bother me as much  as the dismissive attitude of the hostess. Also be warned  apparently reservations dont mean much for balcony seating.   Update after meal : Paul was a great server and the service by the wait team was great. The food was good as always. mac and cheese was delicious  scallops and risotto was good but scallops were on the over seasoned side  and the Tuscany flat bread was nice. The carpaccio is a very well balanced dish. Steak and lobster was a little forgettable but all in all great meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,DELICIOUS seafood.  My friend and I arrived promptly for our 8:30 reservations and were seated immediately. We got a cozy booth right next to the fountains. We ordered a couple of drinks - my two pear martini was fantastic - lots of fruit flavor  but not too sweet.  The bread course has a great variety - there was a salty  cheesy flatbread  a sweet roll  and few other varieties. The olive tapanades on the side were a super salty - but I'm not a big olive fan to begin with.   I ordered the Hawaiian Mahi Mahi. It came  with a crispy crust  perched on a bed of lime and cilantro basmati rice  ginger bok choy  miso butter sauce  and crispy leeks. The lime and cilantro gave the dish a super fresh flavor  the butter sauce was creamy and delicious  and the veggies were a great compliment.   My friend's Chilean Sea Bass was even better - served with risotto full of wild mushrooms  tender sauteed baby spinach  savory port wine beurre rouge  charred endive  and a sharp  sweet  balsamic vinaigrette.  Our server was attentive  our food was amazing  and the atmosphere was outstanding.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This may be my favorite restaurant!  I went when I first moved to Vegas and now again on Easter Sunday.  We had such an excellent meal! I had scallops  they were amazing!  We had delicious martinis! The staff and our waiter was sooo nice and fun and friendly!  Definitely going back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here with my girlfriend Tiffanie who wrote the review below mine lol. The food was very good. I ordered the Fettuccine carbonara which was delish. The bread they give is an assortment. They also give olive spread which didn't look too appetizing but was shocked how good it was with the bread. The service was great also. On a side note we saw Dana White from the UFC eating there so it has to be good right?
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Would not recommend this restaurant. Especially if you are trying to plan an important event  would not pick this place. Very unpredictable - had requests a that were not met. They advised that it was a busy night - mere apology however my night was ruined. Food was mediocre and service wasn't too great.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,OK let me just say this place is FABB!! From the decor to the views of the bellagio fountain to the great staff &finally to outstanding food!! This restaurant is a must while in Vegas! you can't beat it  of course a little on the pricey side well maybe a lot on the pricey side but its vegas! you have to splurge a little :) ... the food was amazing everyone of my friends and bf loved their meals!Not to mention its super romantic can't wait to come back here with my bf on our next Vegas trip!! You have to tryyyyyy it!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Holy smokes! this place was incredible. We just went here on Friday night before we went to see ""O"". This was my birthday dinner and I could not have been happier. First  the three olive tapanades that came out with the bread were super tasty. My husband and I shared the fig and prosciutto flat bread...it was big! Definitely too much for the two of us but I'm so glad we ordered it. For dinner  I had the halibut with shrimp risotto. Seriously...this was the best halibut I have ever had. There was about a dozen shrimp on my plate that were cooked to perfection. The sauce was amazing...mushrooms and some greens. seriously one of the best meals I've ever had. Husband ordered the Adobo Tuna with some polenta and it was as good if not better than mine. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert but because it was my b-day they brought us out a small plate of truffles  lemon  chocolate and hazelnut. Even those were amazing. The service was great  I would say by far my favorite restaurant in Vegas. I wish we would have requested the patio so we could watch the bellagio water show. We could actually still see it from inside the restaurant but next time we'll definitely request the patio. If you want delicious food and a great environment  don't skip this place."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For a Todd English experience  I expected a little more. The appetizers were at least decent-- I applaud the carpaccio wrapped oysters.  The foie gras  although a hearty portion  was -ok- only. I'll leave that to the French.   Onto the entrees.. Undercooked risotto and dry chicken. I had already complained to the staff about the risotto  I regret not mentioning the chicken. Didn't want to seem like we were trying to comp our whole meal. We didn't stick around for dessert.  The staff were attentive but I was still relegated to an iPad to order my cocktails. (Am I at Applebee's?) I want to give you another chance  but I'm starting to see a trend of 3 stars among the recent reviews.   The view is nice  but better appreciated outside while walking the strip  for free.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"What a let down Bellagio especially on Mothers Day!   A great friend of mine had made reservations here a while ago for her sister birthday and she rated them a generous 2 stars but however I still made reservations to come here to see for myself. Don't be like me just avoid this place.   We've been to Bellagio's Fishtail  Prime  Buffet  Lago and Harvest more than once and nothing but exceeding service and food. This place wasn't anything to even compare to the above. When I initially made reservations I asked for a table on the patio a few days well in advance. However  when I checked in there was 45 minute wait. I opt for the inside available seating. Our server Eric came by took our appetizer order and gave us a ""half ass"" run down of the short menu. He took our drink order then too. We started with the Beef Carpaccio and Tuna Carpaccio which is a favorite for us anywhere but here. We received our appetizer before the server had even came back to take our main order  brought us our drinks  bread  or even a plate for the appetizer. So we waited a few minutes to wave down our waiter politely. It took him another few minutes to get our plates  so be it. The quality of the Tuna was awful  but had a great presentation (for what it's worth). We ate what we wanted of it and waited over 20 minutes to get our waiter to take our main order. He was surprised when we replied to him that we wanted to place our order as if he had forgotten about us. After taking everyone's order he said oh sorry if took so long. So it's Mothers Day obviously and I didn't want to be rude so I let it go. Main entree took too long to come out and of course we were all really hungry. The quality and taste of the food are so bland. I felt like I was eating at Applebee's. The service on the other hand was horrific! Excuse me do you mind bringing us a bread basket like all the other tables? Excuse me do you mind refilling our drinks? Can we get a to go box? Can we get our check? Can we get a dessert menu? Can we get our dessert order taken? CAN YOU DO YOUR JOB?!   The cherry on top was the lack of the server handing my mom a flower that they were generously handing out to the Mothers. I didn't even bother asking. I was so disappointed but still paid our $200 and tipped him a too kind  too generous 15% tip. I guess you can't always get your money's worth. Btw  there isn't much Mediterranean to their menu. :("
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We made a reservation here based on some friends recommendation. We weren't disappointed. We got a table on the patio overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio.   This is how to do dinner at Olives.   The weather was perfect and the view was outstanding. Paul was our waiter and we were so well taken care of!  The menu is nicely varied.   We started with the Tuscan Farmhouse flatbread and my wife had a nice pinot noir and I chose a shiraz. Great choices for the venue and dinner!    My wife had the Atlantic salmon and I had the chef's special seafood risotto. Both dishes were exceptionally well prepared and we shared them between us. Deelish!    Huge portions so come hungry and I recommend showing up early for your reservation.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I can't really give a full review as we only sat at the bar and had apps. I will say that this was the best beef carpaccio I have ever had!! The service was great and the atmosphere was amazing. You can sit outside and watch the water show at the Bellagio. Definitely a place to check out.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was a wonderful start to our Vegas trip!  Here are my tips and recommendations: -We came here for my grandmothers 80th birthday and made a reservation on open table about a month ahead of time. I would HIGHLY recommend making a reservation as it seems to get filled up fairly quickly. -We asked for a table on the patio so we could watch the fountains but were told these are not guaranteed and we will just have to see what is available when we come in. When we came to check in we were able to secure a wonderful table were we could watch the fountains several times throughout the dinner.  -The wait staff was out of this world and were super helpful and made my grandmother birthday one to remember -I got the Caesars salad  and although it was a very good salad  it wasn't the best I had ever had but I realize I was paying a lot for the ambiance of the place -The cookie butter creme brulee is the stuff of dreams  it is soooo good!! I am still regretting that I had offered to split it with my sister in law instead of getting my own  Overall  this place was fantastic and will be a first stop for all future Vegas trips!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I don't know who Todd is but either way  it seems he and I both like olives - a lot.  I thought the look and feel of this place was great - dark but warm and inviting inside with views across the Bellagio water to the Paris Eiffel Tower.   As I was perusing the menu when Tammy  the sommelier  came by and asked if I had questions - she was NOT scary or snotty like many sommeliers  do come across. Rather I totally would have asked her a question  - if I had one.  Service overall was good  the buser-water boy rocked. My water glass was NEVER more than half empty. My waitress seemed to care if I actually liked the food. I had:  The days Starter special: applewood smoked Seared sea scallop on pork belly. Served on top of bean-ish things with a strange sticky but yummy jam thing outlining it. Next to this was a blob of green fluffed stuff with nuts on top - NO flavor. I think it was supposed to be whipped avocado something or other but really the only reason I can fathom it being there was for something green on the dish. Overall this was very good but I got a few very salty bites.  The butternut squash tortellonini (sp?) (NOT tortellini - this was a long thin crepe like noodle). With sage in butter and nutmeg sauce. YUM  like dessert on my plate. SO rich in fact  I had to take half home with me (FYI its good room temp too). They gave me this awesome take home bag and utensil kit (wet wipe and toothpick included) too.  Now  I'm not sure which of these items reeked havoc on my IBS right after BUT I live to tell another Yelp review...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Deliciousssss! From the amazing service to the 3 types of olive spreads with a variety of breads they bring in the beginning  this place had me hooked from the beginning. I had a mushroom flatbread and my date had the chicken gnochi. I'm usually ehh about gnochi and after 2-3 bites I get sick of it  but this one had a delicious tomato sauce and it melted in your mouth. My flatbread was not skimpy on the mushrooms  so I liked that because I love mushrooms. The bread and olive spreads filled us up a bit so we had extra food left over to devour the next day. Overall it was a bit pricy  not somewhere you'd come all the time  but very nice for a special occasion. After dinner we went out on the patio in our big coats and watched the Bellagio fountatins. Such a great view! I never get sick of watching it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My first experience at Todd English's Olives will never be beaten. My boyfriend had surprised me with a Vegas trip for my 23rd birthday (my 24th is coming up in exactly five days :)) and this is where he took me for my birthday dinner. As soon as we walked into the restaraunt I fell in the love. The ambiance and design was breath taking. Dimmed lighting  large windows with a view of the Bellagio water show and also an amazing patio which we did get the pleasure of dinning on last September. There is a very warm and welcoming yet sophisticated feel in Olives.  We sat at a small romantic size table and had the most soft spoken yet confident waitress who gave us the most perfect service. In her beautiful accent she explained items not on the menu and recommended a cocktail for us. She was never unattentive and never over attentive.  To start  they bring out an assortment of delicious rolls  breads  etc.. with 3 different types of olive speads. My favorite combo was the sweet roll with the green olive spread. Foodgasm! My boyfriend ordered a Manhattan to drink and let me tell you... that night I turned into a whiskey drinker. You've never truly had a Manhattan until you've had the Olives Manhattan. I ordered something girly and froufy resembling a lemon drop. To eat we ordered a delicious vegetarian style flat bread and a chilled apple soup (its been over a year... it may have been a chilled pear soup!). Being my birthday  they brought out a cute plate reading ""Happy Birthday"" on it wth four bite size mouth watering treats. We still ordered dessert after! We ordered a white chocolate martini and a chocolate fudge cake.   Bottom line  EVERYONE needs to experience Olives! I promise you'll have a hard time eating anywhere else in Vegas after."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I want to give 5 stars  but I just haven't found the ""oomph"" yet.  I've come here several times before in my escapades in Vegas  but just visited recently this morning- a Friday with an arrival at 11:40.   NEGATIVE: uhh  okay. The hostess duo seriously needs an attitude adjustment. Would it seriously kill you to smile  or at least pretend that you are caring to seat customers that could potentially spend hundreds of dollars? Come on. [[enter Harry Potter reference]] --it legitimately looks like a dementor got a hold of these two. Buuuut it's fine  luckily it doesn't impact the quality of food I experience!  Olives is high-class and the prices reflect it. Pay attention to the floor with the beautiful mosaic type of tile in-lay. Great view of the fountains if you're lucky  too!!  FYI: if you sit in any of the booth seating  it feels like you are a child again when you try to peer above the table. Okay  that's a bit of an exaggeration. But  still  you do sink into the booth. Go for the chair.   My waitress was Kimberly and she was phenomenal. She steered me in the perfect direction when I had trouble choosing which cocktail I wanted (#firstworldproblem). I picked the ""Slingback"" -- Absolut Ruby Red vodka  passion fruit puree  & fresh lime juice with a micro-sugar rim. Extremely refreshing but steep at $14 a piece.   You receive some delicious bread- a Parmesan crisp type  an olive bread  and a buttery focaccia. The olive spreads are good but especially tasty if you like the taste of having an ocean's worth of salt poured into your mouth.  TIP: Do not miss the Butternut Squash Tortelli ($17)-- I've ordered this several times and it absolutely does not disappoint. I made friends with the table next to me and the woman I talked to loved her Greek salad and especially the chicken on top.   Overall  service and food are fantastic. Look past the cold hostess pair and you'll be golden."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We only went for salads and appetizer before a show.    Sat inside (with a reservation).  Service was friendly  professional and polished with a front and back server team.   We had the beef carpaccio which was huge  and probably the best I've ever had.  Good texture and flavor  and nice twist on the polenta cake.   Salads were fresh   crisp and flavorful. Tasty and creative cocktail selection  made it hard to choose!   I had a pear mule.   Banquette seating made meeting the next table easy  who happened to be some fun locals that we enjoyed chatting with.   Great location  tasty food!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"This place is really just ""fine"". It's a very nice restaurant with great service  but the food was just ok. I had the Cuban sandwich  which was some kind of Chef's special that day  and it was just kind of soggy. Pretty much devoid of all texture. It came with house made potato chips  (which weren't any good on their own since they had not been salted...at all) so I put a few of those inside to make it a little less boring.   Overall  I don't want to be too tough on Olives. Great service  the charcuterie and cheese app was good  and it's a nice place to go."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"On a recent trip to Las Vegas this is the restaurant I chose for our ""big"" meal.  This is the Las Vegas location of celebrity chef Todd English's signature restaurant  Olives (named for his ex-wife...funny).  This location happens to be in the stunning and beautiful Bellagio Resort and Casino.  The restaurant itself is also really pretty inside  with a FANTASTIC view of the Fountains (and by proxy the Fountain Show) outside of the Hotel.  So if you can score a table by one of the windows  thats some bonus action for you. So on to the food...Unfortunately my girlfriend wasn't that hungry.  She had the Ceasar Salad.  Although she did say it was the best Ceasar she had ever eaten  so thats good.  We also munched on the complimentary Olive selection and warm chewy breads brought to our table.  For my main course I went with the Oven Baked Atlantic Swordfish.  It was phenomenal.  The portion was also pretty large  which was nice (although it stopped me from getting Dessert it was so big).  The fish was cooked just right  and the sauce that came on it was outstanding.  I could've ordered a glass of that!   So anyways if your looking for a lovely dining experience in Vegas  you certainly have a million choices  but you can't go wrong at Olive's  especially with the views.  I wouldn't go back to the one in Vegas  but just because I haven't been to many other places there  and theres so many to pick from.  Las Vegas is dangerous for a foodie.  I think next time I'm in Orlando though  I will check out Todd English's BlueZoo.  Great stuff."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If I wrote this review  two or three years ago I would've given Olives a 5 star rating  I simply think its not as good as it used to be. I'm a big fan of Todd English's cooking and Olives in Las Vegas has always been a favorite as mine  so much that I had to try it in NYC went I went over there for a shjort visit. The Carpaccio  Scallops  and steak were all favorites of mine (even thought the steak was better than PRIME at one point). However at one particular visit  I thought it wasn't as good  but still being one of my favorites I decided to go again  but still thought it was decent but nothing special. I have still gone back for lunch and would keep it that way from now on.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We dropped in at dinner time when they were super full with a wait  but their bartender was able to find a seats at the bar  we had great service and though we had appetizers everything was exceptional. I want to say the olive spreads are worth a visit on their own but the carpaccio was the best I've ever had. I also had the Foie Gras which being from CA is always a treat.Once again would love to try more items on the menu so hope to go back
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view on the outside was absolutely amazing  Got to watch the water show 4 times and it was beautiful the food was also amazing  The service was top notch Shoutout to Argon for being such an awesome server! When coming here it's probably best to reserve a table on the outside so you can enjoy the water show when it comes on and just enjoy the view  I don't know why anyone would want to eat indoors.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was ok  I enjoyed the experience and the service was vexcellent.  Our server's name was Paul.  We had the beef carpaccio appetizer and grilled squid appetizer.  The squid was ok  and the beef was good.  The beef carpaccio was a huge appetizer.  Overall the experience was amazing because of the service and we sat outside with a front row seat for the fountains.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We stayed at the Bellagio and enjoyed a lovely lunch at Olives. We went to another Todd English restaurant the night before (Todd English Pub) and I have to say I enjoyed the ambiance of Olives better. We had cheese/charcuterie at both places and I preferred Olives'. My only wish is that we were able to sit outside to enjoy the view of the fountains-- however  it was a windy day. Maybe next time!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A table for four for a nice intimate Christmas Dinner. I came to this decision because knowing me I was trying to get a reservation the day of Christmas!!!  Well Todd English's Olives said they would be able to around 9 P.M. I was happy and delighted I also looked at the great reviews on yelp. Plus I love love olives. They are soo yummy.   When you walk into this dark light area and candles going it was nice and romantic and just felt very cozy. I loved it and I enjoyed it quite a lot. We got sat on a booth for 2 and on the opposite side were chairs. That was fine with me and we had no problems with our seating. It was a nice view of the water fountain. :)  The bread did taste very well and the olives and olive spread was really good. I enjoyed it a lot. I ordered a salmon that was crusted with so many different flavors it was very different than many places. All I can say is that this place is something special with the uniqueness of style and different ingredients that they use on each dish.  I also tried my aunts chicken which tasted salty and sweet with fruit possible. Anyway it was very different to me and I would say this a place to go and try at least once.   I had a splendid dinner and a great time. :) Also the service was very good  always had my drink refilled and the server was nice enough to check up on us if we needed anything else.   Oh...by the way it is a little bit on the pricey side.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I don't even like olives  and this place blew me away. Ordered the fig and prosciutto flat bread and they nailed it. Service was great  a little loud in the restaurant and definitely a pricey spot but the food was bomb I must say
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I was just at Olive's this past weekend for Valentines Day.  Two words....Delightful Ambiance.....The place was full as I hear it usually is on weekends.  Since this was our first time in Vegas and we hadn't seen the fountains  I requested a table with a fountain view.  It turned out they were able to seat us on the balcony by the railing.  If you will look at the photos I posted  you will see the view was truly something to behold.  After reading the countless reviews touting how supreme the Carpaccio was  I decided I would have to try it.  I was a little apprehensive about trying it when first found out that Carpaccio is raw meat  but when I got to the restaurant I decided that there was NO way I was leaving without trying it  because who knows when id have another opportunity to try Beef Carpaccio.  It turned out to actually be quite enjoyable!  The Onions are juicy and filled with flavor  the Meat has a pleasant taste to it that I cant put my finger on and the sauce and breading definitely complete the meal.  I think its funny though  that after thousands of years without fire and the ability to cook our meat  uncooked meat is considered a delicacy. Just thinking out loud.  The Slow and Low Braised Ribs were so tender that the steak knife was pointless. You could easily pluck pieces of tender juicy flesh away from the slab and every bite was savory.  Since my girlfriend was not having anything to do with the carpaccio (or so she thought. I made her try some and she said it was alright but never again)  she ordered the Alla Napoletana Flat bread ( I posted a pic) which turned out to be pretty good as well.  The appetizers are meant to be shared so they come in large portions.  We ended up having to take half the flatbread home.  She ordered the Ribeye  which she said was okay  but they went a little Overdose on the Green Beans. Since it was an occasion I decided id try a margarita (regret it  should have gotten wine) which turned out to be good.  The gf ordered the Bellini which is sparkling wine and peach puree. Overall the experience was good  and Id recommend the Carpaccio and Braised Beef. What was NOT okay with the experience was that there was a lady from Olives walking around taking professional photographs and offering $50 packages.  When I told her I had my own digital camera and wanted her to please take a picture of us using our camera instead she said ""Oh no  Im sorry.  Theres a liability risk right there and im not allowed"" and she walked away.  The couple at the table next to us had overheard and were like ""Thats such BullSh*t ""  They were kind enough to offer to take pictures of us and we thanked them.  Coincidentally 30 minutes later that same lady was making her rounds  and was like ""Oh what the heck  ill take your guys picture for you""....Now im sure you could see the smirk on my face as I looked her over. I told her we'd already taken pictures but thank you anyways. I looked over at the table next to us and they were laughing and pretty much told me if it were them  theyd have told her to **** off. Haha. Besides that slight incident  everything was great and the staff was more than accommodating!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This has always been a favorite while in Vegas.  The food is always quality and their prices are appropriate for the value received.  Service is lovely and the ambiance is delightful.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow - this place is magical!  Although we opted to wait about 30 minutes after our reservation time at the bar  we were greeted by a nice fellow who bought a round of drinks for us  as well as the couple next to him since they had just got engaged. We returned the favor as well before we were seated.  We waited to sit outside so we can watch the fountains. We must have had the best seats in the house  right next to the railing. Every 15 minutes  there is a new song and show sequence that is absolutely breathtaking!  The food is just as amazing! The staff was very knowledgeable and had the chef create a special  vegetarian risotto for me and it was just as creamy and delicious as I had hoped. If you can go here for a special occasion or just to try a new  upscale restaurant - try Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"First of all  you should always request the patio. Best seats in the Bellagio  very romantic it's three stories high in front of the fountains show. The vibe is something like Sex and the City-ish.  The food  on the other hand  is to die for. Explosions of flavor with each bite. Todd English is definitely one of my favorite chefs of all time.  My favorites: Beef carpacchio Grilled squid and octopus Tuna tartare Rib eye served with tempura aioli green beans and red wine reduction Any of their flat breads Butternut squash tortellini(All time favorite) I always have the ""Tiffany's"" martini. Best raspberry martini in town! Must finish with: Vanilla Bean Souffle"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is consistently great!! Hospitality excellent!! Food top level-the best beef carpaccio!! Duck ragu gnocchi is out of this world!! Best view to enjoy the fountains!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice restaurant. Worth the price and wait. We had good service. Their olive paste and bread is so good. We didn't get the view by the water but it was still a nice experience. Had the wagyu short ribs and sea scallops as entrees. We also ordered the tuna capaccio  mussels and romaine salad. Salad was average nothing special. The mussels were DELICIOUS. Overall I would recommend this place and come back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great view of the fountain! Service was great! Drinks were delicious. Entrees were also not bad but on the pricier side. The seafood risotto (most popular dish at our table) was $44 and the clams and mussels pasta (2nd most popular dish at our table) was $35. Everyone enjoyed their food.   As for the desserts  the pound cake was surprisingly good  particularly when eaten together with the ice cream. The banana tiramisu was decadent and delicious.   Highly recommend making a reservation and requesting a seat by the window (you can't hear the music but can watch the show) or outside on the patio (you can watch the water show but you'll also be listening to the music and water fountain every 15 minutes).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The service was outstanding from start to finish. The dining room was lovely  and the atmosphere lively  but not too loud. I had high hopes when the server brought out a lovely basket of bread and a dish of gorgeous assorted olives and tapenades. Things sort of went from great to mediocre from there. The tapenades and olives were delicious  and the assorted breads looked lovely  but two of the three pieces of bread I had were on the stale side. For the entree  I ordered the meatloaf with horseradish mashed potatoes. The meatloaf was moist  but didn't really have any flavour. I only tasted horseradish on the potatoes in a couple of bites  almost like it had been sprinkled on. The serving was huge  but the food was nothing outstanding. Not bad  but certainly not great. As a local  I would not go out of my way and go through the hassle of a drive to the Strip to have a meal here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"During our trip to Vegas we knew we wanted to indulge in at least ONE good meal for our anniversary. We decided to go to Todd English's Olives Restaurant at the Bellagio and I'm so glad we did. With so many restaurants to choose from in Vegas  we were sold by the delicious-sounding menu and the reviews of the Lump Crab Beignets...on with it.   So we started with the Lump Crab Beignets -- absolutely delicious! I've had nothing like these crispy little balls of goodness. You must try this. You won't be disappointed.  We also ordered the Kobe Beef Tartare -- although it was good  it was not our favorite part of our meal simply because the competition was fierce! :)  I ordered the Pork Chop with Clam Sauce -- OH EM GEE. The absolute BEST pork chop you'll ever sink your teeth into. I typically don't order pork chops  but I'm so happy I decided to be daring that night. I fell in love as soon as I cut into that crispy chop and fed myself a piece that was equal parts juicy white meat and straight up fatty goodness. There's nothing worse than a lean  dry pork chop. BO-RING. This hit the spot and that clam sauce was so good. Hubby was jealous.  He ordered the Braised Beef which was your standard tender goodness you'd expect from a braised beef -- a sure winner for those not-so-adventurous types.   For dessert we ordered their Cookies & Milk Gelato platter -- so tasty and so clever  and get this...they even wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate. Bonus points for attention to detail!  One of the highlights of Olives is you can request seating that allows you to watch the water show during dinner. The place is packed and pretty dim  but service was did not suffer.   Thank you for a memorable Anniversary Dinner  Olives! We hope to visit you again soon."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is a very nice restaurant bar that is located in the Bellagio.    I think they can get pretty busy here during peak dining hours so I would encourage you to make a reservation.  We did so using OpenTable.  Olives has indoor seating as well as patio seating.  You can also choose to sit by the bar.  The indoor area is very relaxing with little overhead lighting letting the natural light from the patio serves as the main source.  The outdoor area is great as well seating around 10 or so groups/tables.  There were large parties as well as just couples dining outside.  This is probably the best place to eat as you will be able to see the Bellagio Fountain Show during dinner.  This area is kept very cool with umbrellas and misters throughout.    I would say this place is pretty formal in terms of attire.  The menu and service here are great with a nice selection of flatbreads.  They provide you with a drink and dessert menu that is presented through an iPad.  A very modern way of dining and a definite need at more venues.  Service was prompt but not overbearing allowing us to dine at our own pace.  You are served bread and olives while selecting what you would like to eat.  I had the flatbread and it was really good and refreshingly light.   I would suggest coming here for a nice dinner or even for a few drinks at the bar with its great selection and appetizing bites.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I don't think this place was as great as I had expected it to be.  Was w/ a group of about 8 people.  The service was great  but the food was less than impressive.  From the basket of rolls (very dry)  to the carpaccio (too much sauce and too much dressing on the accompanying salad)  to my entree (scallops with too much lemon juice)  everything to me was just sort of mediocre.  I did like the chocolate cake for dessert  and we also got the peanut butter bread pudding which was tasty.  There was some foccacia in the bread basket too  that was absolutely delicious & perfect in texture.  But overall I expected better of the food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My husband and I were in Las Vegas for a couple nights for a conference.  We asked around for advice on ""the one place to go"" for a special evening with great food.  Nobody's advice was really that great.  My advice?  Go to Todd English's Olives in the Bellagio.  The food is excellent  the price is acceptable  the setting is classy  the service is wonderful and friendly  and there is even the chance of sitting on the patio for front row seats of the legendary Bellagio fountain show.  At your table  you'll enjoy the complimentary olive tapenade to death.  We had the portebello flatbread.  It was our all around favorite piece of the meal.  We got a lobster mac n cheese on the side instead of with the steak.  It was killer.  We had the cod cake appetizer.  I might reccomend something else  or one of their flatbread concoctions as an appetizer instead  in case you were skipping it.  They are really great.  We also had the Pacific Sole- paired with a great Pinot (the tablet wine list and interactive pairing menu really helped confirm the choice there)  it was perfect.  We were too stuffed for dessert  but their options looked great  plus they gave us a complimentary little treat for our anniversary which was in the same month (how cool!).    As to the service  we did in fact sit on the balcony and watch the fountain show in our laps.  I couldn't imagine a more romantic or perfect venue in all of vegas  having perused and researched the town a bit.  Again  the perfect one night dinner out for a couple.  Getting a reservation is something the hotel consierge in the Bellagio couldn't do for us  but which the hostess (Erica?) made seem like the easiest thing in the world when I talked to her in person.  The conference went late  and I had to cancel  then move my reservation  making it even more difficult to get in  but she worked it all out and we just showed up and walked right out to our seat!!!  It seemed like usually there is a waiting list and such  so this may not work out the same for all  but I'd give it a shot because it is so very worth it  and they are so very helpful. The actual server was helpful and prompt  and tastefully out of the way (I'm not into the whole ""I'm your server and the center of your attention this evening"" bit that you get at other places).  We are so lucky to have figured this place out on our own.  It should be on everyone's lips as the go-to spot."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Weak service and overly fussy  cold entrees.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We were slacking at finding an ""upscale"" place to eat on a a busy 3-day weekend in Vegas.  I relied on Yelp again to find some good eats.  We called about 2 PM the same day and was lucky enough that someone has just called to cancel  and we got in for 4 people at a prime 7:45 PM.  Olives is in the Bellagio in the mall area.  The hostess was very prompt and professional and seated us in our table.  Our waitress promptly arrived and asked for our drink orders.  She seemed disappointed that we only ordered ""tap"" water (we had enough to drink during the day and the night before)  but nevertheless it came promptly  and was kept full for the duration.  The menu was sparse with a variety of types of food on it.  Our group ordered the Mahi Mahi and a couple of types of raviolis.  The highlight was the Mahi  with a Shrimp Risotto.  The fish was cooked perfectly  and tasted very fresh (for the desert).  The only complaint that it was very salty.  For dessert  we ordered some falling Chocolate cake  which I think fell from the sky because it took about 25 minutes  but it was excellent.    As we were enjoying our dinner  we realized that we were by far the youngest group there (Mid 20's).  Oh well  we were dressed up to.  Nice simple decor and a view of the fountain show.    About 50-75+ per person  but the food and atmosphere are good.  Worth a try for a nice dinner in Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"(Written after my trip to Vegas  July 2008) My father ranted & raved about this place and insisted we eat here. When the busser came around to fill our water glasses  he couldn't understand a simple English phrase such as ""no  not bottled water"" and brought bottled water anyway. Bad taste! Please hire people that speak English if you expect them to speak with and wait on your customers. The olive spread that was brought for our bread was tasty  I enjoyed that part of the meal. For my lunch I ordered the portobello & tomato panini. Expecting it to be a light lunch  it was extremely heavy and greasy. It made me feel queasy for the rest of the day. Overall  this place was not worth it. Not an excellent dining experience as I strive to find in my adventures in life. Next time I am in Vegas  I will certainly pass this place up."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Wow  the food here is excellent. I went with my family before going to see ""O"" and really enjoyed it. We were able to walk in and get a table without a wait  which I was really surprised about. Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered calamari as an appetizer for the table  and then shared two of the flatbreads. We got the prosciutto and fig flatbread and the smoked salmon one. They were both excellent and that was plenty of food for four people. We had one child with us  and they were able to make buttered noodles for her. Those were the best buttered noodles I've ever tasted - very gourmet for a kid! Both the bread they brought to the table and the olive tapenades served with it were excellent."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Picked Olives based on the reviews and with the hopes of sitting on the patio/balcony  but it was full since it's a popular place to sit given the fountain view. So we sat inside  which was still nice. Our server was nice as well. This restaurant serves nice bread with assorted olives and olive tapenade. I ordered beef carpaccio  my mom ordered the crab stuffed prawns  and my sister ordered the Greek salad. Everything was good  but it wasn't amazing. Also  the prices were a bit higher than they should have been. For dessert we ordered the chocolate fallen cake (their most popular dessert)  which was similar to a souffle cake. Again  it was good but not amazing. Overall  that was my experience.. Good but not amazing. If I go again  it would be for the balcony view and some drinks. Would rate Olives 3.5/5.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives was recommended to me by a fellow passenger on a recent business trip. I was so excited to take my husband there during our recent trip to Vegas. It was a perfect day  as we arrived right at opening time. Upon approaching to get seated  the hostess just stood there staring at us  and never properly greeted us. It was so awkward that I had to speak up and say  ""We'd like a table for two  preferably on the balcony"". She never once said a word to us. We should've left then and there  but I was starving. From the point at which we were seated by another hostess  things improved. The fountain show and coordinated music were awesome. I ordered the pasta dish with sweet Italian sausage  while hubby ordered the Salmon. I definitely enjoyed my meal more than hubby.   But I must say  we will never return and I wouldn't recommend Olives to a friend because of the rude hostess. As they say  first impressions are lasting. And there are way too many other restaurants where we can spend our hard-earned money!  And for the record  the hostess was an old White woman (55-65 yrs old). We just so happen to be an African-American couple in our 30's  who make a combined income of about $300 000. We were both dressed professionally and well-groomed-as always. Yet  a White couple in their 30's walked up behind us  dressed in jeans  t-shirts  and a baseball cap--looking ever so bummy! The hostess lit up for them  saying  ""Welcome to Olives. Thank you for dining with us today. Would you prefer indoor or outdoor dining?"". Go figure! Not necessarily saying that race was a factor  but just saying....  I hope that Olives' management reads these reviews to see how the selection of your staff affects your business. I've already shared our experience with a few friends and family members (both Black and White). You may want to retrain your staff on proper Customer Service skills towards all customers."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Scallops are tender and juicy! Great flavor in the pork chop entree although slightly over cooked. Foie gras is superb! I couldn't find an appreciation for our side of fried zucchini. It's too reminiscent of bar food. The server  Paul  was great from start to finish. Super friendly with good humor. The manager gave a very nice birthday wish to my wife. Tables are a bit small and too packed. View of the fountains are fantastic.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Life is Fresh is the best drink I've ever had. The ahi carpaccio is amazing too  and the bartenders rock. This will be a definite ""go back"" next time we're in Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent!  My husband and I went here for my birthday lunch  based on a friend's recommendation.  Definitely get a seat outside just so you can watch the fountains.  We had a reservation and only had to wait a few minutes for a table outside.  We started with cocktails. The white sangria is excellent  my husband liked his dark and stormy as well.    We received complimentary bread  olives  and tapenade  and we could have made a meal out of that alone.  We got the pepperonata flatbread as a starter  I got mushroom pasta as an entree and it was AMAZING.  The service was fine  no complaints.  The food was excellent  the scenery amazing  and I am looking forward to going back on my next trip to Vegas!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had reservations for 7:15PM on a Friday night and had to wait a bit before we were seated. I chose this restaurant mostly for location and convenience since we wanted to have dinner before watching the O show.  I ordered the Grand Island Nebraska Beef Tenderloin which came with buttered asparagus  lobster whipped potatoes  red wine demi. The beef was cooked and seasoned perfectly! For dessert  I shared a Banana Tiramisu and Nutella Cream Brulee. The banana flavor wasn't that strong for the Tiramisu  which I liked and the Nutella Cream Brulee was good too.  Too bad that the weather was too cold to sit in the patio to enjoy the water show outside. Overall  I had a great experience and would recommend!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nice restaurant and servers. I forget who our waiter was but he was great. I could be butchering the name but I had the brick oven chicken which was good but not the best. It eventually got a little dry. Should've went for the steak -- next time! Their starters are very tasty however  so enjoy those. Overall it was a good experience and we may be back during our next visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For all the hype about a celebrity chef the wait was long but the food and service was just about ordinary. It wasn't by any means bad  but it didn't meet celebrity chef standards. The bartender and cocktails were awesome. The waitress was all smiles but didn't give clear recommendation or information about the food. The grilled squid and octopus with chick peas was completely under seasoned. Salt and citrus  are basics for seafood and this dish lacked both. That's unforgivable for an upscale restaurant like this. The portion size was huge for an appetizer. The entree was sea scallops served over mushroom risotto. It was cooked perfectly and risotto was creamy and well seasoned. The dinner highlight was the surprise birthday cream filled donuts sever with a chocolate handwritten birthday wish on a plate with a little candle. While I enjoyed the meal   I have had better meals and experience at other fine dining restaurants locally . Nothing to rave about   just another overrated place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I just had lunch here with two friends. From start to finish it was two hours for lunch  I think this is unacceptable. We were seated right away and greeted pretty quickly. The server was pushing a glass of Shiraz on me which I agreed to. He also took the drink order for my two friends. We got the 3 wines 15 minutes later  and when i asked for bread he said it would come after the menus were gone but he still hadn't taken our order. I had the Cesar salad that had no flavor and the tomatoes were too ripe and very mushy. My friend had the tuna carpaccio which was good and had very nice presentation.   The entrees came after an hour and 20 minutes from when we sat. We had to ask three people about our food and we heard our waiter ask someone where it was also. I had the pasta special which was with chicken  mushrooms  peas on paradelle. It was very bad  all the flavors muddled together and the paradelle was thin and overcooked. The chicken was shredded which I've never had on a pasta with white wine sauce  I didn't even finish a third of it. My friends had sandwiches which were just fine. We had to split the check and the waiter made a big deal about it and said he had to talk to the manager. For what i detailed above at lunch  it was $150.   I would never go back to this restaurant or any other Todd English restaurant.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I wouldn't recommend a carryout order from here. I live apx. 7 miles from Bellagio & that's plenty of time for freshness to hold true. Unfortunately  the proteins were severely undercooked & I felt robbed because there is nothing one can do about there order once they get home. The Salad was good with an abundance of all ingredients. The flat bread was undercooked and soggy. The octopus & squid was disgusting and should have never been sent out of the kitchen.  Such a shame... I was so looking forward to my $60 carryout meal & it turned into a $60 salad. I feel taken advantage of. I would like a refund of 2 of 3 dishes.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Known to be simple Neo-American cuisine that pays attention to its ingredients  overall it was a good experience. The interior design was very flowy and romantic  kind of like Lothlorien meets old Spanish metal lamp sculptures.   We shared three appetizers and a main course. The salad was satisfactory  the two different styles of foie gras served on one plate was what I looked forward to as soon as I saw it on the menu. One was warm and roasted  one was steamed. Mm... foie gras.... The only thing they failed on was that they did not de-vein the thing properly  which meant it did not cut cleanly and I was fishing for the stringy things. But it tasted great.  An interesting part of the menu was an offering of various flatbreads  topped with various offers. We got the simplest one with buffalo mozzarella sprinkled with dry herbs. It was nice and soft  the mozzarella having a bit more dense and less stringy consistency than plain mozzarella  which tells me there was actually thought behind the choice rather than just novelty. It reminded me very much of the pizza I had at Mozza  and I preferred this one much better.  The main course was seared salmon with a pepper crust. Very unfortunate in that the server was late in picking it up from the kitchens. It was sitting under the heat lamp for so long that by the time it came to us it was near well done. It still had decent texture  but because it was meant to be seared it wasn't flavored much  but since it was too cooked when we ate it  it tasted very bland. Definitely something I would try again when done right  to see it would have been. With every other dish done pretty well  it was a feeing of sadness more than disappointment.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was a little disappointed in the meal and experience. It was okay but not the quality that I expected at the Bellagio. The flavor and presentation were okay buy I was looking for an old world flavor that reminded me of Tuscany or France. Service was rushed. Ambience was crowded and loud.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The serving size is super huge no matter of appetizers or entree!  Food tasted ok  my pasta was way way overcooked that it glued together like a mess while the veal sauce tasted excellent.  My bf's pasta was average just slightly better than Olive's Garden.   We were much better off to grab a crepe at Jean Philippe instead!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I ate their on November 1st.  The supper was amazing the view of the fountains with the back drop of Eiffel Tower.  Erica seated us and took great of us  she set aside a table on the patio against the railing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The best food you will ever eat! The Carpaccio will blow your mind and if you have room for the main course.... Go butternut squash all the way or better yet another round of carpaccio. If you want the best bang for your buck go for lunch and ask for Joy! it's not as busy  they have more time just to work on your order rather than being in the middle of madness and Joy  well she's exactly that a Joy. The best thing about this combination is you will get a taste of what Vegas used to be. First class service  first class food and you are the V.I.P. wether your spending $30 or $3 000. If you have a problem she will move mountains to fix it  she goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and most importantly she lives by the old Vegas mantra 'the customer is always right and priority one'. If your from out of town the experience will make your trip and if your a local you can't help but come back for more and you might just meet a true Vegas contact and friend. Don't forget the carpaccio and raise a glass to the good old days.         Quick tip if you don't want to walk through the casino  the Bellagio has a valet side entrance right on Flamingo and the restaurant is in the door to your left go down I think about three or four shops and it is there on your right  but if your visiting take the main parking in  go through taking the larger walk ways until you get to the shops and then on your way out rather than going left to parking go right and you go directly into the atrium. It doesn't cost any money but it costs the casino millions it is absolutely gorgeous and a ton of work  it always seems to amaze. They change out the theme every month or so depending on the time of year. Hope this is helpful
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I liked the wine.  The food was yummy.  But for the money  I want a better overall dining experience.  The talbes were tooooooo close together.  ps - for the ladies  the floors are slick tiles.  Take that into account when selecting the stilletos you're going  to wear here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The ambiance if you are not right by the fountains is nothing to write about. It's dark in there  so much the bill has a neon light which is super bright & annoying.  Now for the food. The olives dips were very salty - I mean very salty. Hard to enjoy. The beef carpaccio is by far the most ordered item. We didn't get an appy  but saw plate after plate of it come out. It was a very big portion. I ordered the tenderloin and my friend got the scallops - unbelievable. Both dishes were done perfectly. The steak was divine and served with asparagus & lobster mash. The scallops served with veggies. Def go there!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Second time back was even more impressed!   I went for the first time in 2008 with the girls as we hit up Vegas. We 'waited' at the bar to see if we could get a table as you couldn't make reservations back then. Definitely not patient enough to get a seat on the patio we were seated 1/2 way through our first round of wines....no complaints here. We each got a few appetizers for the table and the ONLY thing I can remember from that first trip is the beef carpaccio. It literally melted in my mouth!   So headed back to Vegas for welcome in 2011 with my fiance (a magnificent cook and foodie) and 3 Australian friends. As I have been to Vegas before I wanted them to choose what they wanted to do....I had one request....ONE dinner at Olives. So we saved it for our last night. On a whim (the morning of) I went to our concierge to ask about a reservation and to my surprise she called and got us a 5:30 seating!   Upon our arrival we were seated immediately. My one concern is they really packed us in there but I wasn't complaining! It was a Saturday night and I was beside myself. Bread basket has some crunchy flat cracker with seeds that went super well with the olive tampenade. I prefered the black over the green. And they should consider not chopping the olives so much...it almost was a puree but still soooo tasty. They also included a cranberry walnut chocolate roll in the bread basket. It was sweet and I was surprised it was in the before dinner basket but really liked the flavor :) I don't think I will ever turn down chocolate  I don't care what course it is on.  Terry (fiance) ordered the Layer Cake  a Malbec from Argentina. Spectacular choice  we even ordered a second bottle. It is a great red that goes well with everything we ordered....and at a decent price (for restaurant wine pricing that is). I can't wait to find this for a cheaper price at my local liquor store! :)  Of course I ordered the beef carpaccio as it was burned in my memory forever. I was not let down....it was as good  if not better  than I remembered!  Kate ordered the flatbread specialty  a wild mushroom flatbread. Very rich and filling.   Bevo ordered the tuna tartare  I was especially surprised and pleased with this pick! I love tuna but this seemed just so delicate and fresh.   Patty ordered the squid and octopus which was served with some garbanzo beans and a smokey broth....I was really surprised of this flavoring but really enjoyed it as it was a way I have never had it seasoned and flavored before.    For dessert Terry and I split the Butterscocth brulee. Magnificent! (and butterscotch is not my first preference when it comes to dessert flavors) This dinner just wouldn't have been complete without it. I also tasted Patty's espresso martini that was perfectly balanced of espresso and liquor!  So although we didn't do entrees we were all stuffed and each got out with about $50/person including wine and with being able to taste so much!  If I EVER make it back to Vegas my one requirement will be to make it to the patio to watch the fountains from Olives  my favorite place in Vegas!  Synopsis: 1. Get a reservation if possible (on the patio if nice weather) or be prepared to wait for a table....it is worth it! 2. Order the beef carpaccio  you will not regret it 3. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is mine and my bf's go to place for a romantic date night. It's so nice being able to sit on the patio and watch the Bellagio fountains a couple of times throughout your meal.   Everything I've had to eat here has not disappointed. They start you out with olives (not really my thing but they look good) and seriously THE BEST bread basket in the history of bread baskets. I know my carbs and the white chocolate rolls are on the top of my list. I ordered halibut with a shrimp risotto on top and my bf got a steak. Both came out and we absolutely loved them. We were too full for dessert  but the waiter was kind enough to wrap some more rolls up for me to take home.   The service  atmosphere  and food will surely not disappoint!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I had high expectations going into this restaurant  and since it was conveniently located in our hotel  I thought ""why not?"" for a nice Christmas Eve lunch. For the appetizers  we had the Tuna Carpaccio  Grilled Squid & Octopus  and some kind of steamed mussels dish. The Tuna Carpaccio and Grilled Squid & Octopus were good  but nothing spectacular. As for the mussels  a couple of them were not even open and for the few that I had  there was this really unpleasant taste that lingered in my mouth. I've never had mussels with that kind of foul taste before... ugh. As for the entrees  speaking for everyone at my table  the resounding feedback? Too salty.  My brother  who ordered the Chicken Margherita since it was one of the ""Chef's Selections""  could not even finish his food. My sister  who ordered the Ricotta Ravioli  liked the ravioli  but said that the sauce was way too salty. My father  who seemed the most satisfied with his dish  had the Beef Fillet  and my mother had the Spaghetti Alle Vongole  which she thought was okay. I had the scallops  and the worst part of the dish was not the extremely salty rubber scallops  but rather the crunchy... undercooked risotto.  I would've loved to come back for dinner on the patio to enjoy the fountains with my meal  but that's okay. I'd rather not."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love Olives and I try to dine there as much as possible. I reccomend the patio seating because it faces the fountains and you have a lovely view during dinner. Everything from the bread to the olive tapenade is amazing. Their drink menu is featured in an Ipad. I had the double pear martini and it was perfect. The beef carpaccio is amazing. I almost ate half of it myself. I still haven't tried a better beef carpaccio than the one from Olives. My ricotta ravioli was perfection. This is a good place for a date because the lights are dim and it has a very romantic vibe to it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"So let me say right up front that -- in my experience -- celebrity chefs' Vegas restaurants are ALWAYS a notch or two BELOW that chef's ""original"" eatery.  The Vegas location is far too often a showplace  a place set up by the casino-hotel to draw in (or keep) patrons by having his (her) name on the door  but with little connection to the famed chef once the menu is approved  the kitchen trained  and first month of operation has passed into history.  (See my write-up of Nobu  as one example; and why go to Bouchon when the original is so [relatively] close to where we live?)  So it was with some trepidation that we boarded the Southwest flight to Las Vegas for my daughter's 12th birthday.    You know Southwest . . . you get there early  board the plane as part of the ""A"" group  and then wait as the subsequent hoardes of of ""B's"" and ""C's"" crowd the aisles -- moving nowhere  because someone's behind is blocking the aisle as they struggle to squeeze that rolling suitcase that should have been checked anyway into the overhead that's already too full with everyone else's stuff and . . . .   But I digress.  So I'm sitting in my seat -- the exit row with the extra legroom -- and waiting for everyone to take their seats so we can get this plane in the air  when I look up from my in-flight magazine with the spiffy articles  and who do I see standing in the aisle in front of me?  Celebrity chef Todd English.  OK  I've been to Boston; I liked the original Olive's and Fig's.  Our eyes meet; I say ""I like your food""; he says ""Thank you "" and works his way farther back to a free aisle seat.  I ask my wife if she noticed who that was.  ""Who what was?"" one of my daughters says in a gramatically incorrect but clearly understood reply.  ""Todd English "" I answer.  ""Who?""  ""Todd English "" I repeat  as if saying it again makes it any clearer.  ""Oh "" my youngest daughter says  ""I saw the name on the shirt  but I thought that was the designer -- you know  like Tommy Bahama.""  (Yes  it's true  Todd English was wearing his black chef's jacket with his name embroidered on it.)  I thumb through the in-flight magazine  find the ad for his New Orleans restaurant ""Riche"" and show the kids his picture.  ""Ooooooh "" they say simultaneously  suddenly much more interested.  So the wife and I explain who he is  that he was on the original (pilot episode) of Iron Chef America  that he has restaurants in Boston  etc.  etc.  About then  the plane pushes back from the gate  the ""talkers"" explain how to buckle a seat belt to all the people who haven't been in an automobile in 30 years  and we take off . . .   By the time the plane lands  our daughters are psyched up to have dinner at Olive's in the Bellagio  and I call from the airport to see if I can get reservations for dinner that night.  I can.  I do.  And that's that.  We get to the Belagio  and walk the mile and quarter from the Valet to the restaurant  and I give them our name.  We wait for about 10-15 minutes to be shown to our table  and as we walk in  Todd English comes out from around the bar to head off someplace and we nearly bump into each other.  We say hello to each other and shake hands; he looks somewhat surprised to see us; I say  ""Where else would we eat tonight""; he laughs  thanks us  and we go off in two separate directions -- him  to who-knows-where  and us to a gorgeous table outside on a patio overlooking the spectacular water fountains at the Bellagio.  Dinner was delightful.  The service was superb.  The food was fantastic.  The waitstaff was wonderful (even to the extent of taking a picture of the four of us for my daughter's birthday with his cellphone and sending us the picture!).  The sommelier was sorry that the name of the winery I worked for was mispelled on the list.  And for the first time . . . the food I had at a Vegas restauratn was BETTER than I had at the chef's original location.  All I know is that THAT night was magical!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Food and drinks were amazing. The staff took excellent care of us. Loved the view from the patio. One of my new favorite places in Vegas!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The four stars is for the manager. After Picasso it's hard to beat. The scallops is kind of sweet and on top of curry rice it's kind of odd for us  and the seafood with pasta need improvement on the flavor too plain for us. Then the manager replaced with um hum juicy steak cook with perfection.... delicious
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Better than expected. Made our last night in Vegas memorable. Make sure to get a table by the railing for the best view!  FOOD  Thanks to yelp reviews  we ordered what came with good reviews. Ricotta Pasta was great. Grilled shrimp was very good  portobello flatbread was decent. The view was amazing. Make sure to get seated an hour before sunset.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Absolutely perfect! Our reservation was for 7:30 and our table was ready promptly. Walked through the indoor portion to the outdoor patio where our table was. The only thing I thought was strange was the tables indoors were a little close together so my purse kind of hit some chair. Oops!  Our server assistant was very friendly and very attentive and our server just as well. To start our meal we went with Perrier Jouet and the ""Greek"" Style Baby Romaine. Excellent and very tasty. The entrees came out right as one of the water shows started which we had the best view of. I decided on the Ricotta Ravioli and my boyfriend decided on the Grand Island Nebraska Beef Tenderloin with buttered asparagus and lobster whipped potatoes. Both came out phenomenal. Cooked perfectly and the lobster potatoes were to die for. Lastly for desert I got to pick and went with the Chocolate Peanut Butter Lava cake. Very rich and the flavors were so perfect. Valentin the GM checked on our table regularly which was very nice of him and brought us an Anniversary plate to share.   Overall the experience was 100% amazing. The staff were polite and very attentive and the food was well prepared. Our table was right on the railing so our view was the best  however since our table was right there we noticed that every time the fountains would go off people would come crowd around the table to get a picture which was a little irritating but I understand that's what they came here for."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had one of my best gourmet burgers here  and it was because of one thing: soft  spongy buns.  The meat was cooked well  and was accompanied by grilled red onions  green lettuce  and large slices of tomatoes.  Yum.  The service was friendly and warm.  The atmosphere was elegant and cozy.  The portions are quite huge as well  so it might do some good to skip out on the appetizers.  Four solid stars from me!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is average ! I ordered bunch of items to for sharing in the family! None of the dish was WOW! It is pretty expensive comparing to the tasted that you'll get! The service is pretty good! I didn't sit outside but it looks gorgeous!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If you can get a table with a view  fantastic. Unfortunately we went when there was a large corporate event that took up all of the patio tables. We sat right smack in the middle of the entrance of the restaurant so it was a bit awkward having people walking by and staring in. Other than that  the food was great and the portions are pretty big. I love that their desserts are also big enough to share and not just a bite per person.. they were legit enough for two! The creme brulee and strawberry shortcake were delicious. I would even swing by just for their desserts. :P
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place  really really has great bartenders and staff. Best martini on the strip.The food was great as well. We sat at the bar due to no reservation but never felt like we missed out. Make a reservation give it a try or just walk in and have a couple drinks. You won't be disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Took my wife here during our trip to Vegas as I wanted to take her somewhere nice. Unfortunately the fountains at the Bellagio weren't on that night due to the wind.  Thankfully the food more than made up for it. We both got the 3 course meal for $50. My wife had the smoked duck salad  trout and strawberry panna cotta - I had the mussels  sirloin and chocolate pudding. All were superb and the breads  olives and tapanades were fantastic as well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I went here for lunch and had the burger and fries  which were very good.  I was fortunate enough to have snagged a balcony table.  You get a fantastic close up view of the Fountains of Bellagio  so close  in fact  that you'll probably get a little wet (just a little  don't worry).  It was pretty warm today  though  and I wish I wore a hat and had some sunscreen.  Anyways  the view was worth getting a little warm  and I walked away with good memories.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was in the restaurant last night.  My friend  and I arrived pretty late  but were told we could still order dinner if we sat at the bar.  Andrew was friendly and very accommodating when my friend didn't like her flatbread pizza. I had the lamb chops which were amazing! She had the flatbread replaced with the mushroom risotto. Awesome!  Will definitely come back again and hopefully will be able to sit on the patio to watch the fountains then!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Olives is a great double date spot and highly recommended by us locals. The atmosphere is warm and relaxing  with nice views of the Bellagio Fountain show. They start you off with a tasty selection of breads  olives  and tapenade that we couldn't stop gobbling. Their mixed drinks were delicious - the cable car is divine. We ordered a steak  salmon trio  prime rib  and a rabbit duo. The only ""miss"" was the rabbit  which was a bit dry and tough. Everything else was wonderful  and you'll wonder why you've never had salmon tabbouleh before when you try it.  Our vanilla bean souffle for dessert wasn't a miss exactly  but it wasn't terribly special  either. You'd be better off strolling across the casino and through the atrium to Jean Phillipe for some outstanding gelato. If you're looking for a great meal with good service and not an ounce of snootiness  though  Olives is your place."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A very solid place to dine while in Vegas.  Nothing too over the top  or extraordinary  but a menu full of very flavorful food in an exciting atmosphere.  Also serving a nice selection of wines and great mixed drinks.  If on a date and looking for more of a romantic dinner   I would suggest  asking for one of the more secluded tables with views of the Bellagio Fountains.   Outdoor seating also available.   Will be back during one of my future visits to Las Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Beautiful few especially if you you get seated on the balcony. Serve staff will give you negligent service if they feel your not going to tip. Food is ok  don't reccomend the pasta it's on the small side. Flat bread is great same with the drinks.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The view of the Bellagio Fountain Show make it a 5 star. The service make it a 5 star as well. The food is probably a 4 star as the portions are small for the price. If you are sitting out the patio  it will be extremely hot even with the misters which dont seem to put that much mist on you. The Chefs special Butternut Squash Ravoli was sweet  melty  handmade  and perfect to satisfy that fall taste. The fountain show comes on every 30 mins but they have mini-songs about every 15 mins. So during a lunch you can expect to see about 4-5 water shows. If you can snag an outdoor seat at night  do so. It will be a very romantic evening experience.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Really really awesome flat bread. We have been there 3 times in our last two trips to Vegas.  The entrees were also very good  but not spectacular like the flat breads.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've eaten at a lot of fine dining establishments during my time living in Vegas  and Olives is by far the worst  and one of only two restaurants that I refuse to go back to (the other being Prime  located just up the mall from Olives).    Where to begin? First  our party of three arrived for our 8:00pm reservation a few minutes early  and had to wait until about 8:30pm before we were seated -- strike 1.  We ventured to the bar to wait  where I decied I'd try one of their speciality cocktails they were offering for the night - except not  because they were out -- strike 2.  When we were finally seated  we were crammed into a crowded  loud  dark corner where we could barely move -- strike 3.   To expand  the atmosphere and ambiance of Olives is awful.  They have crammed way too many tables into their already cramped dining room  for no other reason than because they can  I would suppose.  The wait staff is constantly bumping into the backs of chairs and are forced to reach in front of you to accomplish even the simplest tasks.  A side effect of the crowded dining room is the noise.  Even at a small table  you can forget about conversation unless you feel like losing your voice from shouting by the end of your meal (I'm exaggerating  but this place is WAY too loud for a high-end restaurant).  The lighting is ineffective  and the tables are so dark that you can barely see what you're eating - this is not necessarily a bad thing  because the food was so overly complex  that it failed on just about every level.  Yet another restaurent that fails because of what I like to call 'Top Chef Syndrome' - leave the campy molecular gastronomy  overly complex sauces  and useless garnishes to the few professionals that do it well  and get back to the basics of just cooking your food well.  Everything (with the exception of the osso buco  which was the only highlight of the meal) was just not up to par with a restaurant of this reputation and price.  Our meal for three was close to $600 - apparently we gambled  and lost  on this one.  I wouldn't go back here even if someone else was paying.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I thought the appetizers were really good. I had the seared foie gras steak and the beef carpaccio  both were absolutely delicious!   I was not impressed with the fig & prosciutto flat bread. The prosciutto was cut too thick. Although I have to preface this by saying that I just had the prosciutto thin crust pizza at Mario Batali's Enoteca San Marco restaurant in the Venetian the night before  and it was absolutely delicious. So in comparison  Olive's prosciutto flat bread fell flat.  I also tried some of my husband's Grilled pork tenderloin dish  it was average.   The atmosphere was cool  but for the money  I would go with Daniel Boulud at the Wynn or Batali's Enoteca San Marco!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My wife and I make it a point to eat at Olives when we are in Vegas. We must have dined at Olives at least a dozen or so times.  We start with a class of Prosecco and The Fig Prosciutto flatbread. A fantastic way to start the meal! When I entertain clients  Olives is my ""go to"" restaurant. Last October we took some friends to Olives and they agreed it's a great dinner.   The service is usually excellent . . . except this time. My wife and I ate there Tuesday  7/23 and our waiter was okay. A couple times we had to hunt him down to get something. I had ordered the Maytag Martini. (Next time your in the mood for some great blue cheese try Maytag!) The martini arrived with pimento stuffed olives instead of Maytag. When I pointed it out to the waiter he brought over a couple of Maytag stuffed olives on a napkin rather than have the drink remade correctly. He then disappeared until after we had finished our dinner.   On their comment card I had written out what happened and asked the hostess to give the card to the manager on duty. I then saw her hand the comment card to the waiter who stuffed it in his back pocket. So far we haven't heard from Olives so I suspect he just trashed the comment card.  We are hopeful that the service on our last visit just means they have a bad apple on their wait staff. We'll give them another chance  fingers crossed. As I said  previously Olives has always been very good."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Be sure to make a reservation if you want to sit outside and view the fountain show. Since the balcony is not guaranteed  you must arrive early to put in the request. Dinner starts at 5 and you have a great shot if you arrive 15-20 minutes early to wait in line for the restaurant to reopen.   Wait staff is friendly and the ambiance is superb.  It is a little overpriced; we weren't quite prepared for just how pricy since the menu online has no listed prices. However the Handcrafted Gnocchi was delicious and the North Atlantic Sea Scallops w/ mushroom risotto was so good  there are no words!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very nice place to have a meal in Las Vegas. Everything was just perfect. It's the kind of a place where you just want to have a great dining experience and excellent service.  Do reserve a head of time if you want to sit outside and watch the water works in the Bellagio pool.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Go to spot lunch or dinner in Vegas - not overly fancy or avant garde but just darn good food and ambiance
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Got lucky and got a table by the fountains on New Years weekend the view of the fountains is spectacular and the food is amazing.  I was buying with house money I won at craps so I treated myself to a nice 3 course meal.  Very impressive place with quality food and service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives is always a mainstay when I go to Vegas! The dishes are consistently fabulous  the staff is so friendly  fun and accommodating! The salmon salad cant be missed  love their flat bread and desserts are bomb! Check out my pictures.  We sit at the bar most of the time for quick service but the outdoor veranda overlooking the Bellagio Fountains cannot be missed!  Take that special someone and make some memories!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I didn't actually get to eat here.  I had reservations.  I wanted to sit on the patio.  I checked in and told the waitress that I wanted to sit on the patio and I was willing to wait however long it would take and she said no  absolutely not possible.  Even if I'm willing to wait 2 3 4+ hours?  No  it's impossible  she states.  I just left.  I was so looking forward to that dinner but it didn't happen.  Disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wonderful lunch and service! I highly recommend the beef carpaccio. We also had a fig and prosciutto flatbread that paired nicely with a bottle of a sparkling rose. The wait staff is top notch. They did a great job start to finish.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is by far the best restaurant I have ever been too! We ordered several appetizers which tasted amazing. Also  we sat outdoors and you can see the whole view of the fountains in front of Bellagio while you eat! I would fly all the way from the East Coast just to eat here again!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Everything we had was amazing! Beef carpaccio  white fish with shishito mashed potatoes  and scallops with mushroom risotto. All was awesome and you cannot beat the view!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Good view (bellagio fountain) + good food + good service = 4.5 stars!  Bread Basket + olive tapenade= delicious (but BEWARE... do not fill up on  bread  even though it tastes great  gotta save room for the amazing food)  Beef Carpaccio = AMAZING!!!!!!!! This is a MUST if you go here! Seriously  it is melt in your mouth amazing!   Fig and Prosciutto flatbread= sweet and salty. savory to the extreme! a must try!!!   Go here  try it out! but make sure you have a RESERVATION  this place is always packed. So a reservation is your best bet.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The salmon entree and the scallops risotto was amazing. The salmon was moist  and the cream sauce that went with it compliments it perfectly. The watermelon salad was light and perfect too. But the dessert was a disappointment. The creme brulee was good and it wasnt too sweet. However  the molten lava cake was overcooked. The cake didnt even came out warm  and i wish it was a little more bitter than sweet
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very dark place inside so don't eat here if you like to see your food. Sitting on patio would make all the difference. Wouldn't eat here unless you're seated outside. Food:  Rolls /relish too salty. I had chicken entree $29   average at best  pretty dry. Wife had butternut squash ravioli...a bit soupy with more butter than butternut...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,So tasty topped off with fantastic service.  Arrive ahead of your reservation and ask to be seated on the balcony. The view can't be beat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This review considers a couple of italian dishes on their menu. Failed the Italian test: gnocchi was hard and our Italian dishes were ready in under 10 minutes! The mushroom pasta wasn't all that either.  I'm used to much better Italian food in San Francisco. This might do the trick for folks who frequent the olive gardens and maggianos of the world. Perhaps I'm being too harsh  it is billed as a Mediterranean restaurant after all. But it don't get anymore Italian than gnochhi. At around 20 bucks a pop  I'm expecting the softest gnochhi that doesn't resist the bite and that doesn't come out in under 10 minutes a after the order was placed. I can count half a dozen places in San Francisco with better Italian fare for 2/3rds the price.  Service  location  ambience  however were very good  in true Vegas spirit. Maybe their non Italian menu items are better. Again  take nothing away from the place itself. You're paying for possibly the best view in Vegas  good service and ambiance. Also  some fancy wine sommelier tablet thing on the table that seems to be there for more form than function.  Evaluate your priorities before going in.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came here for dinner on Thursday night at 6:45. Although we had reservations for 5 people  we still waited a good 15 mind for our table.  Ambience: this place was happening. The vibe is nice  especially on the patio. Clientele appeared more business oriented. Older crowd by far.  Service: mostly it was really good. Out waiter was on top of things. They did recommend a veggie dish that turned out to have meat. That was corrected right away. Water was constantly refilled. Food came out at a decent pace. The waiters recommendation was good. My only issue was that the rib eye special ran out by our 7pm slot. Food: overall food was good. I wasnt impressed with the bread (cold and hard). The beef carpaccio was really good. It is def meant to share and came out like a salad. Very good flavor. You wouldnt even know you were eating raw beef. My main entree (since they ran out of the rib eye) was the lamb pops. I asked them if they can have the same accompaniment as the rib eye (lobster mac n cheese and bacon brussel sprouts). The lamb was good and cooked well but only had 3 pieces. I would have liked four for my main entree. The mac n cheese was disappointing. It was mixed in with the brussels sprouts and i couldnt even locate the lobster. The Brussels sprouts were ok. Maybe i should have opted for the sea bass. That got rave reviews.  Vegas has a ton of great restaurants. I would prob opt to try a different one. Its not bad but nothing that stands out.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just as delicious the third visit as it was the first.  My only complaint would be the seating assignment. I booked a table for two over 60 days in advance with the request to have a patio table. I chose 6pm thinking that it would still be light outside at that time and the patio might not be as popular for requests as it would be later in the evening.  Anyhow  fast forward to the evening of our reservation. We arrived 15 mins prior to check-in. Patio was completely full and although I had made a reservation  we were told a table outside would not be available until approx. 6:40 (almost a full hour after our arrival).   (Insert pouty face here) However  if this classifies as the biggest wrench in our trip - I'll take that any day.  We were seated at the window  so all in all  we were able to enjoy our evening right away.  Bonus: we had the best ever server named Jaime B. She was professional  attentive  and most importantly made us feel so much at home. Her pacing of the meal was spot on! We have dined here twice before in years past and her service was far superior to the fantastic service we had before.  Okay  the food. THE FOOD!!!  This is why we keep returning to Olives.  Their bread basket and signature olive spreads are phenomenal. I know... bread? Phenomenal? YUP. Can't even explain it - you must try it. And whatever those parmesan crisp things are... Mmmm they are great!  We then had the charcuterie board: If you love cheese and meat as much as we do. Get this. You will not be disappointed. It also had spicy cucumbers in a cute little jar.   Main dishes: I had the Nebraska Beef Tenderloin (medium) with asparagus and lobster potatoes. Yes you read that correctly. LOBSTER IN MY POTATOES! Heaven help me. I ate every. single. morsel. This would be my request for a last meal if I was on death row. Seriously.   My husband had the Seafood Risotto that pretty much had every thing found in the ocean in it with a little chorizo thrown in too. Hot damn that was good! It wasn't as creamy as risottos I've had in the past  but that didn't derail the dish.   Too stuffed for dessert. Yep  you read that right too. For once in my life  I was too full to order dessert. (Next time I won't let that happen! Ha ha!)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Where to begin.... For me  this is THE Olives to go to. Better service  nicer staff and even a better menu than the NYC location.  We booked our Bellagio stay via Virtuoso and part of the perks was a dining voucher for Olives. Little did we know what a treat we were in for. Our waiter was excellent  let us move tables twice and kept the bread and oil coming before we had ordered a single item. His attitude didn't change when we told him we had a voucher - which is huge. Almost a huge as the portion sizes! I am  as I mentioned before  a food whore. There cannot be enough food. But...Olives came close. And it wasn't just the quantity  it was also the quality. The beef carpaccio was a poem on a plate...delicious  thin and lean slices of well seasoned beef over a bed of polenta and some greens...mouthwatering. We also got some flat breads  scallops and a few other items. Spending the amount on our voucher without overeating proved to be mission impossible - but that's what to go bags are for!  Between the amazing location (overlooking the Bellagio lake)  the great service and the amazing food (which truly is well priced!) this place is a 'must' for any of our future trips to LV!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Always wanted to visit a Todd English restaurant. Popped in here today for a quick lunch. A very contemporary and classy atmosphere  with tons of indoor and also outdoor tables overseeing the Bellagio fountain. Service was prompt and friendly. The tuna carpaccio was very tasty with olive oil mashed potatoes. My pasta pescatore with red sauce  prawns  clams and white fish was delicious! The spices in there really elevated the dish! My wife's shrimp linguini looked pretty good too! There is also a large bar to accommodate walk in who wants a drink. A well rounded restaurant for lunch or surely dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was my first time dining here. Great ambiance. If you sit on the patio you can view the water show but you do get sprayed by the mist.  We didn't want to wait for a table on the patio so we ate inside which was still very nice..and dry!    To start I had a Slingback which was a ruby red vodka  passion fruit puree  lemon sour and sugar rim. Super yummy. Then we had the fig and prosciutto flatbread which was amazing and the tuna tartare which was okay.   I had the pan seared halibut with risotto and spinach.  The fish was perfectly cooked and the risotto was creamy and delicious. My friend had the sea scallops which were also perfectly cooked and tasty.   For dessert we shared the cookie platter and the hazelnut souffle.  I didn't eat any of the cookies but the souffle was to die for. They bring out the souffle and place the vanilla ice cream in the center and pour as sauce into the center. It all melts together and is super light and airy but creamy. It was definitely worth the 15 minute wait.   I can't wait to eat here again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There Brussels sprouts and truffle fries are delicious!! We had to settle for bar seating because the wait was more than 45 mins. The bartender (waiter) was awesome and really took care of us. Would for sure go here again :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,A trully Vegas hangover cure!   Lobster roll Sunny terrace with The Bellagio fountain backdrop
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The food was tasteless and the beans were not cooked and hard. All four of our meals had no taste with the exception of the sea bass but it was on top of the hard beans. very very disappointing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in Las Vegas in a long time. The service was impeccable (Frank was the waiter). The Caesar salad had a very delicate and flavorful dressing. We also had an excellent Greek salad. For my entree  I had the carrot hummus which was so unusual and delicious. It came with thin strips of pita that were baked. I also had the oxtail soup  with a rich broth and tender chunks of vegetables. The breads were assorted  freshly baked  and scrumptious. My husband had the cheese ravioli with sausage - as good as we recently had in Italy. All in all  a divine dinner. Hats off to the chef!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Holy crap  get the $18 beef carppacio appetizer.  Normally when you order beef carpaccio you expect about 8-10 thin slices... not here.  You get seriously about 1/3 lb of beef.  I wouldn't say it's the best beef carpaccio ever  but it was very good... and with a generous portion.  I elected for the 3 course prix fixe menu.  Came with a watermelon salad  seafood pasta and fruit sorbet for $32.  Pretty cheap.  The watermelon salad was.. okay... the seafood pasta was good  albeit a bit bland and boring.  the sorbet was pretty good.  My gf got the scallop risotto..... which was amazing.  The risotto was flavored with truffles and I could be wrong but the bite I tried from her had actual pieces of black truffle....... it wasn't just truffle oil!  I was jealous of her dish.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,There is a lot to expect from a Las Vegas Strip restaurant. Everything has to be on point because remember these prices are usually more expensive on the strip and in vegas than lets just say Bakersfield CA. This place Olives was a total let down and let me explain why.   I have been to MANY different types of luxury restaurants everywhere in the country and notice everything from the front of the house to the kitchen to etc... This place just had a small portion of what makes a restaurant great. So let me begin.  It was five of us that wanted to go to dinner on that Saturday night 05/28. We are staying at Bellagio and since it was a long weekend we did not want to leave the hotel and go on the strip because it will just take forever to go somewhere so we decided to go to this restaurant. When we approached the front we asked for a table of five. Immediately got shot down from the gentleman because we did not have a reservation. While I understand dont get me wrong if it is a reservation only restaurant I am all for it but you also have to remember that we are paying customers. Anytime you have a chance to take in a paying customer you TRY to make an exception out of it and see what you can do for the paying customer. So after we were told we only need a reservation a lady who i assume was a manager or supervisor said that she can accompany us to a table with out a reservation (hence why I am giving this place two stars instead of one. an EXCEPTION was made)  We sat down and was greeted promptly by a gentleman who was nice and after about 15 mins we got our complimentary bread and dip. I was wondering why it takes this long to bring out some bread and dip but since it was packed that night i knew certain patience would be in order so I didn't really get mad at that point on why the bread was taking forever to come.   so we ordered our entrees and i made the worst mistake in ordering the Ravioli because let me say that dish literally tasted like someone unfroze a TV Dinner and Microwaved it. THERE IS no WAY that is made FRESH and if it is than the chef should be ashamed to accept that type of dish to go to a customer. I should have sent it back but I didnt feel like waiting literally an hour for a new dish to come.   Wait time for food= TERRIBLE. My god it took literally maybe 30-45 mins i want to say to get our food. Now i understand that its a busy restaurant but that's not an excuse at all. Customers will wait for good food so when food comes out  make sure it is GOOD food and not the shit i ate. Terrible.   One positive note is that the Lamb Chops my Dad's GF ordered after she was done i had two of them and they were FREAKING AMAZING. Probably one of the best I have ever had in my life so i will give this place a star for that.   Overall: Probably would never try this place again unless I am craving lamb chops. Kitchen is a disaster when it comes to expediting food. No one should have to wait more than 20-30 mins for food and when it comes out tasting so bad  than that is terrible. Staff was nice  waiters and everyone was nice dont get me wrong. my this was just the quality of the food and how long we waited.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,For the most part  I don't venture to the Strip for my meals. After hosting my parents this past week  I realize I have what might be best described as an ethnic food addiction. This past week I experienced major withdrawal  as my parents prefer casseroles to curry.   We went to Olives for a big family dinner. In addition to my parents  two uncles  one aunt  a great uncle their spouses and a distant cousin were also in town. Heck  we should have shirts made. Anyways  we had a great table right next to the window overlooking the Fountains.   The breadbasket contained some delightfully sweet rolls. They were like a healthy  wholesome cinnamon bun  but without the icing and more bread like. I ate several of those tasty buggers. I ordered the chicken. I know: boring. The leg part of the chicken was good  but when I got to the breast  it was dry. I barely remember the accompanying sides. I think there were some potatoes hiding under there! Everything was covered in a gravy--very Southern  but not necessarily to my liking. I have a problem when a sauce is drizzled over every item on the plate. It was good but not scrumptious  and I want scrumptious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a great experience. We had dinner reservations at 9:30 though we had requested a table to be in the patio there was none available  but that's okay they assisted us by finding a nice table inside with the window views  they also suggested that for dessert we would be offered a table outside in the patio. What impressed me the most was that they didn't forget the suggestion they actually came up to us and asked us if we would like to move outside for dessert  what great service!   They start you off with bread assortments paired with olives and two different tapenades. A little bit on the saltier side...  Dinner was great  the steak was my absolute favorite very flavorful tender and cooked right. We also had the cheese platter which came with various garnishes one was more tastier than the other. Was very impressed with the service and the ambience of the restaurant. If you are in Bellagio you should definitely stop by. If you're lucky enough to get a table outside the views of the fountains and the strip is amazing at night. Definitely five stars  will go again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I got there at 6pm and all the patio seating was gone. That's really the only place to sit  so you can enjoy the outside fountain show. I got the butternut squash ravioli but it was just so-so. The  olive spread and warm bread was good. They gave my friend a free desert for her birthday. But I felt the waiters were very pushy in getting us to order a lot.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wow...what a view! Made a reservation for Sunday night and had to wait about an hour because I requested patio seating and let me tell you it was WELL worth the wait! You are right there for the Bellagio fountains (behind them) so you get a different perspective/backdrop.  Jamie was our server and she was so sweet! I asked her what she recommend for a drink and she told me the slingshot( or back...can't remember exactly) which was awesome. Very light  and creamy. Very very delicious!   The food was good  not incredible but it was good. The highlight of the meal was the drink and then the dessert. Cookie butter creme brulee! New favorite thing ever! I will totally return here just for the drink and the dessert....they are THAT good!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've eaten here every time I'm in town.   Great food and great view of the fountains at the Bellagio.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service was excellent  but food was mediocre. My bf and I stopped by for lunch since it looked crowded and we figured that the food was good. He got the fish and chips and I got spaghetti with meatballs. The fish came out as fish nuggets with Mcdonald's style fries  I've never seen fish and chips look so cheap  its always been fillets. Half the meatballs were cold  and the others were warm. I barely touched my plate  but the bread was good  and olive dips were definitely the best I've ever had. Guess I should've stuck to ordering the restaurant's namesake.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Oddly enough  I have never dined at the original Olives in my hometown of Boston  but on a recent visit to Vegas   my husband and I decided to have lunch at the Olives at the Bellagio. Olives serves up Mediterranean-inspired fare with potential views of the famous Bellagio fountain. If you are lucky enough to score a seat on the patio  you may get to see the fountain's ""performance"" while you dine.   We really enjoyed our lunch  we started off with the Beef Carpaccio which was very generously portioned and very  delicious. We followed it up with a Portobello flatbread which was crispy and rich with wild mushrooms and white truffle oil."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When we arrived we checked into the host stand and  they were kind and seated us in the main dining area near the bar. The patio was full but the bar was alive and busy. the noise was a bit loud but that can be expected in the area in which we were seated.  The waiter seemed impatient and almost immediately grabbed the wine and drink list from us without making any suggestions. We had to ask for it back later and the same nonchalance was given.  The bread and olive pastes were exquisite!  The meal: we received our dishes but one of our entrees came out cold and had to be returned to be reheated. Sea scallops were good and so was the onion soup but was not the very best but no complaints. The butternut ravioli which we were told was prepared in a unique and special manner was kind of alright. Not the best nor the worst either and for the price was not an excellent value.  The banana tiramisu was delicious and espresso martini was heavenly to end our experience. Overall this is kind of a good experience but I think I had higher expectations of the food and service that we're not met.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives provided us with a very tasty lunch with a wonderful view.  We had the fig and prosciutto flatbread to start with and that probably could have been enough with a salad.  But we pushed through and each had the butternut squash ravioli.  It was so worth the extra effort  and it's easy to see why that dish was one which helped make Todd English's name.  I look forward to trying it for dinner at some point.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My 1st time back to Las Vegas in 3 years and this was one of the best places I've eaten at(probably one of the best Restaurants on the Las Vegas Strip). Me and Nathan were walking through the Bellagio and decided to stop here for some drinks but it ended up being our Dinner destination. Todd English is a master of Mediterranean Cuisine and one of my Favorite Chefs it was nice to eat at his establishment. We sat at the Bar and we were waited on by a Bartender named Zach (cool guy  so down to Earth). Nathan got himself Vodka while I got a Cocktail called Bababuie (Silver Blanco Tequila  Creme de Cassis  Lime Juice and Drambuie) Creme de Cassis is a Sweet Liqueur made from Black Currants and Drambuie is a Golden Liqueur made from Scotch and Honey.  Nathan wasn't feeling all that Hungry so all he got was a bowl of Crispy Taters with Thyme and Garlic. For my Appetizer I had Grilled Squid & Octopus with Chickpeas  Tomatoes  Garlic  Parsley and a Hummus Vinaigrette (Tender Octopus  texture is like Grilled Sausage  the best way to eat Squid is Grilled I love that is was swimming in an Ocean of that Vinaigrette but too many Chickpeas on top  I would've preferred less). I also enjoyed some homemade Pita Chips.  For my Entree I got Gnocchi handcrafted with Yukon Gold Potatoes and Parmesan Cheese mixed with a Corn & Leek Puree with 2 different Preparations of Duck  a Ragu of Duck Confit (which was Incorporated with the Puree and mixed into the Gnocchi) and thin slices of Smoked Duck Breast along with Cherry Tomatoes and finished with a Drizzle of Pomegranate Reduction (There was a lot going on  Gnocchi that were light as a Cloud  Tender duck infused with a Smooth Creamy Puree of Sweet Corn and Mild Leeks  get a Pop of freshness from the tomatoes that sliced Duck had a subtle but not to intense Smokiness and the Pomegranate gave some Tartness.  They also make Flavored Vodka's in House  Blueberry  Pineapple and Blood Orange  I tried the Blueberry and it was Awesome. For Dessert I got the Coconut Pound Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream topped with a Malibu Rum Caramel Sauce along with a Scoop of Watermelon Sorbet with Fresh Berries (It was a big piece of Cake that resembled a slice of Texas Toast  Crisp on the outside but Soft and Fluffy on the inside topped with Sweet Vanilla Ice Cream  the Caramel was Rich. The Sorbet was a refreshing finish to the meal  although I didn't have any of the Berries).  For a After Dinner treat Zach whipped up a Cocktail called the Slingback (Absolut Ruby Red Vodka  Fresh Lemon Sour  Passionfruit Puree  Simple Syrup & Lime Juice). It was both Sweet & Tart and the Sugar on the Rim helps tone down the Tartness with each sip you take.  This was by far one of the best places I've dined at on the Las Vegas Strip  I'm gonna recommend this place to my Dad for our Group Dinner next year. See ya then !!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"At Olives within the Bellagio  You'll find shades of light Caravaggio    Would love to portray.    Its chefs  I would say  Hit zesty home runs like DiMaggio.  The dark interior of Olives with its spot lamps creates a play of light on dark that a 16th century Baroque painter with a dramatic flair for chiaroscuro would appreciate. The evening we were there  they also hit a tasty home run in my culinary ballpark. However  you don't have to know much about Caravaggio or Joe DiMaggio to appreciate the goodness of this excellent restaurant at the Bellagio.  We arrived early on a Friday night in February before attending the 7:30 Cirque du Soleil ""O"" show. We were shown to a table next to the window where we could easily see the fountains out front. Our waiter  Paul  promised not to dally too much so that we wouldn't be late for the show. Because we were time constrained  we only ordered main courses and wine. There were five of us who ordered and shared four dishes: a sirloin  a beef tenderloin  a pork tenderloin and (last but certainly not least) a lamb popsicle special that I hogged all to myself except for a few bites.  These delicate lamb chops  served rare  were simply luscious. I sampled the tenderloins and sirloin  but their flavor paled next to the lamb. Complementing the meal perfectly was a Petite Sirah from Clavo Vinyards near Paso Robles  CA. There was absolutely nothing petite about its robust tongue-tantalizing presence. I got my big ""O"" for the evening  not from Cirque du Soleil  but from the meaty delights found at O-lives.  Being that we were at the Bellagio  the meal  the tastiest I had in Vegas  was a major $$$$plurge. The bill (excluding tip) came to $330 for four entrees and two moderately priced bottles of wine."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great place for lunch. I love the bread basket here. The parmesan crisps and the onion bread. Mmm. I started off with the tomato flatbread and prosciutto and fig flatbread. Both solid.  Main course: I either get the butternut squash ravioli or a steak. The ravioli portion is small and it was a bit too sweet. Still very good.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"As there are many reviews  I will stick to a few points:  1. Gorgeous views of the Bellagio Fountains!!! Sit on the patio if possible (unless it is the middle of summer and you are willing to redo your makeup after your face melts off)  unless it is windy  in which case you want to sit just inside at the windows.  2. The bread and olive spread is beyond heavenly. I had to hold myself back to keep from eating so much I couldn't eat my entree.   3. Fun ambiance and trendy decor.  4. Great place to eat before seeing ""O.""  5. No service problems/issues here with the exception of waiting a little longer than planned to get the table near the window we had reserved.  I would definitely go back when taking another trip to Vegas."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Came here because of a recommendation from a friend while staying in Las Vegas and had a Greek salad with grilled chicken. The waiter was excellent  very friendly and personable. My salad was good  I just wasn't really ""wowed"" by anything we had in particular. I would happily return there for lunch on my next weekend getaway in Vegas !"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was recommended to make a reservation here for the outside terrace where there is a stunning view of the Bellagio light and water show. Great recommendation.  For three girls  we had two appetizers and split a less expensive bottle of red wine and it came to around $100 before tip. A good value for excellent food  service and a great show.  As young girls on a budget  we chose the cheapest red wine on the menu and the server - a lovely older gentlemen was nice enough to point out that it wasn't a typical wine and doesn't have much flavor so he gave us a sample. Definitely the blandest red wine I've ever had. We were so grateful that the server was looking out for his guests rather the check average. Or at least it seemed so. So we ordered his recommendation  a wine only a few dollars more.  As for the food - ordered the beef tartare and the fig and proscuitto flatbread. The beef tartare was very good  but the flatbread was out of this world amazing. So simple  but the ingredients went so well together.  If you had to go to one nice restaurant while in Vegas  this one is a good bet. Excellent food  great view and show of Las Vegas and wonderful service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Lunch Prix Fixe menu. $30.  Salad was a bit on the salty side but a good mix of the greens and dried lemon. Soup was a good choice too  not too salty. The yellowtail entree was well done  perfectly cooked. The other things on the plate though  not so much. Dessert was also good  pumpkin mousse.   The bread and olive spread were absolutely delicious though. I even took a basket home.   Overall this restaurant barely made it to four stars  I'd say that it would be good to try and the price  well  you're probably paying more for the view than for anything else.. So get a window seat.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Went in without reading any of the Yelp reviews or knowing anything other than that this place is run by Todd English  whose immensely complex recipes I've always liked. I was very impressed. The meal was not haute cuisine or anything very experimental (in fact the dishes seemed addressed to a wide audience) but it was one of the most satisfying meals I can remember. Let me echo Yelpers' praise of the butternut squash tortelli  which is so heavenly that I can't imagine that I will ever see this classic being done any better.  A friendly waiter with cool wraparound glasses took charge of our table for the evening  which had a fine view of the Bellagio fountain which had the unfortunate accompaniment of a Lee Greenwood song. The waiter was very knowledgeable and hospitable  even offering to split my pasta dish so that we try a few varieties. Started us off with some cocktails  which initially struck me as pricey but after a couple more days in Vegas seemed like a rare bargain. Nice varied breadbasket with olive and walnut tapenades. Ordered a beet and watercress salad special with port and bleu cheese dressing  which was original and outstanding. Continued with sea bass  which was excellent but not transcendent  and the unforgettable tortelli  which though half the price of the meat options was better. The desserts were also excellent; English seems to have downplayed the complexity of the desserts (I have the Olives desserts cookbook  which demands about a day's work per confection) a little  though not to their detriment. The ""Triflin' Drunk"" is an alcohol-and-chocolate eightball. The tangerine creme brulee was a bit easier on the tummy but equally delicious.  Highly recommended. Reasonably affordable (we paid around $60 per person for a three-course meal with the lower-priced entrees and one cocktail apiece)."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I was here couple months ago  is located inside of Bellagio Hotel  very outside view for the Bellagio fountain.   Service I give 3 stars  for a restaurant inside a 5 stars hotel  I expect higher services.   I have a lunch meeting here  I got here around 2pm  which the place was slow.   I thought since I'm meeting someone  I will first seat at the bar and wait  and while I'm there  why not try out what they got on the menu.   I ordered the Tuscan Farmhouse - It was just okay  nothing really brag about.  Truffle Fries - You just can't go wrong with Truffle fries. lol   So before my order got there  a few drunk women and guys came up and sat next to me and start speaking very loudly  so I decided to moved to a table instead.  Since I moved from the bar to the regular table  they never assign anyone to serve me  I was sitting there for good 20 minutes  my glass is empty for awhile  no one ever bother to come check on me. Now I'm not sure how the tips work  maybe because i was sitting at the bar first  the tip should go to the bartender? I don't really care  I would have happy to pay more tip if someone willing to take care of me with refilling my glass.   Overall  food was just okay  service is 2 stars ""IF"""
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"In my poor college student life  there are rather few opportunities to get dressed up and spend some money on high-class dining.  Luckily  the aligning of the stars (along with the double-whammy of getting paid today *and* it being restaurant week) allowed me to go to Olives at Bellagio today  for a three-course lunch.    ""Be advised that our attire is business casual.""  Or so they said  and I obliged with a button-up shirt and slacks.  I was late for my reservation  but they seated me immediately  despite how busy they were.  My friend and I were seating at a table near the window  which was good for viewing the fountains outside  and we were quickly asked for our drinks by the server Julie.  We ordered a Pellegrino and lime to share  and ordered our Restaurant Week prie fixes.    Starting with the bread tray  I was prepared to be amazed.  The large pieces of bread were very good:  chewy and spongy  and perfect for soaking up the olive and olive-oil tepanade.  It was gone quickly.  The star of the bread tray show  however  was the thin pita-chip bread with cheese.  It was so good that I wanted more  and they gave us more during the course of the meal  as requested.  I had the BBQ pork tart  which was incredibly good  with tender pulled pork baked into a buttery bread tart  topped with blue cheese and a strawberry.  An odd mix  but one that worked together well.  I think a bit more cheese and a bit less strawberry would have helped it just a little.  For the main dish  I had the lamb chops with the Fattoush salad  which also very good.  The lamb was again  very tender and flavorful  and without the gamey taste that many lower-end lamb places seem to leave in.  The only gripe about this was I ordered a medium rare lamb chop  and they said it was medium rare  but it seemed closer to medium well to me.  It did not detract from the experience  however.  Finally  the dessert was an interesting mixture of chocolate pudding  vanilla ice cream  and white chocolate liquer glaze  each of which complimented each other well.  By this time I was very full  but even so  I ate every last bite of it.  Overall  the experience was good.  The service was good  but for the most part left you alone.  Since we ordered Pellegrino  the bottle was on the table  and we did not need to be refilled.  It took a little bit too long to be given dessert  however  and if I wasn't engaged in such a good conversation  I may have been a little annoyed about it.    All the staff was professional  and adhered to the Bellagio Signature standard.  I even asked someone who hadn't helped me at all where the restroom was  and was walked to the entrance of the restaurant  upon which time he pointed to the hallway that had it  immediately dropping the conversational chat he was having with another server.  It's good to know where their priorities are.  Recommended!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had the antipasto flatbread. It was average.large pieces of artichoke and sundried tomatoes with olives. ravioli was average. The side of lobster mac n cheese was kind of disappointing. Wish it was less watery and more creamy. Good service.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was quite unimpressed with the fare. For over 30$ a plate  i expected more than breaded fish sticks when i ordered halibut cheek. I expected my daughter's spinach not to make my gag reflex twitch with memories of frozen spinach mush from my youth. I also wanted some good olives  and although the bread was top notch  as was the olive tepenade  the actual olives tasted worse than the ones i buy from Trader Joes.  At least the service was decent if unenthusiastic. Seems like some servers think because i do not drink i don't know how to tip. Too bad for them.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My new husband and I went to Vegas for our honeymoon  and after reading some encouraging yelp reviews  we decided to check out Olives during our stay at Bellagio. It was by far the worst restaurant experience we had during our 5-day stay. My husband had been feeling a bit under-the-weather  so we chose not to order any drinks. Once the waiter realized this  he paid absolutely no attention to us except to bring us the food and the bill. He didn't even ask us how the food was  which was too bad  because it was TERRIBLE.  Everything looked pretty promising when we brought it out  my husband had the salmon and I had venison on top of bacon polenta. The polenta turned out to be the most offensive part of the meal. It was dry  mealy  and over salted. The spinach side was also too salty  and while the venison was decently cooked  it was ruined by the horribly textured mess underneath it. I left most of my food on my plate  and my waiter flew by the pick it up without even beginning to ask if I enjoyed it. My husband's salmon was significantly better than my dish  but still unremarkable for a $25 dish.   The only upside to our experience was the olive tapenade and bread basket that was served during the wait. Delicious. Unfortunately it did not make up for horrible service  and lackluster overpriced food.   Don't waste your money here  if you're in the Bellagio go to Yellowtail  it's incredible!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had very high expectations for this place  and it did NOT disappoint!!! Everything I tried was fantastic. We shared the fig and prosciutto flatbread  which was very tasty. For my entree  I chose the Veal Agnolotti  and they were amazing!! The mix of flavors and textures  wow!!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I ABSOLUTELY love this place. First let me just say that while all of Las Vegas definitely has the ""service"" part down. Olives has taken that and run with it. The service here has always been personable and efficient. If you love Martini's definitely visit the bar and see what latest concoction the bartender has whipped up. The food is in one word PERFECTION! The atmosphere is great for a date or special occasion. Request table 83 out on the veranda overlooking the Bellagio fountain and take in the views of the Eiffel tower across the way as well. I love to explore new restaurants when I visit Vegas  but Olives gets me back every time!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I picked this place because of the location. I didn't mind the food reviews just because I really wanted to view the fountains. With that said  the food was okay. I think that the service was what made the kicker for me to have actually enjoyed this place.   I ordered the mushroom flat bread and my boyfriend ordered the club. Overall  his sandwich looked great and he says that it was really delicious. My mushroom flatbread was good but could have been better. The drinks that we ordered were just simple vodka tonics and jack and cokes but the great thing about them were that they were strong and delightful to drink under the beaming sun.   The show was awesome to enjoy but I'd probably would have liked more privacy. People were coming out of the restaurant and would gather around the table. I suppose I understand but then again  it's just common courtesy  right!?   The service is what made the experience worth dining. Our server  Joy  was just that -- a joy! She was honest  funny and very attentive. I'd come back to just request her. :)  Ohhh  that reminds me! Even though it was over 100 degrees  the host turned us away because my boyfriend was wearing a tank. I suppose I understand but we were going to sit outside for goodness sakes! Well  she saved our table so I'm grateful for that but just a FYI for future diners - if you're even going for lunch and sitting in 100 degree weather  you must wear something with sleeves!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Returned for lunch today  and am never disappointed! Made reservations for 4 for a late lunch on the patio. Seated shortly after we arrived with a great view of the Bellagio Fountains. (a late lunch  you'll get to enjoy the fountains)  Not a fan of bread baskets  but this one you can't pass up.  Fresh olives and olive tampanades to spread onto a variety of fresh made breads.  The flatbread is crisp  cheesy with a kick... I could have made a meal out of it.   We ordered the Ricotta Ravioli  Rainbow Trout  Skirt Steak and Beef Carpaccio.  We all had a bite of each others entrees loving everyones cholce!.   The Ravioli had a sausage  tomato basil sauce that was hearty and light.  The Rainbow Trout  cooked perfectly on top of a heap of fries with truffle oil.  The Skirt Steak had a maytag crust and served with grilled vegetables including grilled romaine lettuce.  Beef Carpaccio melts in your mouth with a savory mustard. Its served on top of mountain of mixed greens with polenta hidden underneath.   The great thing about Olives is if you have enjoyed an entree before  months later  you can order it again and experience the same great taste. They are spot on everytime  and the service is excellent.   Looking forward to going back!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The host and hostess went out of their way to make sure we had amazing table for my birthday.  It was very much appreciated.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was pretty excited for brunch on Mother's Day.  Great atmosphere  great view of the Bellagio fountains  but everything else was average at best.  Ordered a Bellini that they forgot to bring out  10 minutes later after everybody at our table was enjoying their drinks  I asked the waitress to get a Mimosa since I haven't received my Bellini.  Nonetheless  she brought a Bellini.  Okay  no big deal  I'm easy.  My father in law's chicken came with a long hair sticking out of the chicken  which we sent back.  He ordered a Caprese flat bread instead  which I thought they would comp  but didn't.  I ordered a Mimosa again with the waitress  and she must have taken a moral stance on Mimosas  as she brought me another Bellini.  The Seabass was very fishy  but the Scallops were pretty good.  Overall  I thought average at best.  I'd like to think it was just an isolated incident  may or may not try again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Carpaccio is great. Sea bass is a game changer.  Make reservations!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place is great! A little on the expensive side so be prepared to dish out a little more for your average size plates but I seriously recommend making a reservation with a request for a seat on the patio in front of the fountains. It's a marvelous view and so worth the extra expense. Unfortunately  the winds were too high to have the fountains on which was a total bust but I imagine if they were on how incredible front row seats to the show would have been. I had a fantastic waiter which his name was Paul. I overheard him speaking to another guest that he has been waiting tables for 17 years at the Bellagio and loves his job. That is a BFF waiter you want! I highly recommend his services for anyone. Again  little pricey but your in Vegas so yeah....lol
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This restaurant is located in the Bellagio Hotel and is known for it's breathtaking view of the Bellagio Hotel water show.  Make reservations  especially if you want a good view of the dancing waters.  Many love to view the dancing waters so come early and come often.   The waters the food the service make the total experience worth the visit to Olives.   We were instantly greeted by our waiter.  He was very professional and knew the menu perfectly.  He recommend the popular drinks and allowed us to review the menu.   Drinks and appetizers were great.  The bass was wonderful and the butternut squash tortellini was divine.   We ordered sorbet for dessert but all the dessert choices were tempting.    The water show  service  food were all top drawer.   This was five star yummy.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The man friend took me here for a date night while we were staying with his family over Thanksgiving.  The decor is nothing too memorable and it's another one of those dimly lit restaurants  but the view of the Bellagio water show was pretty spectacular.  Request a table near the window if you can.  Unfortunately  it got really window as the night progressed so the water show stopped at just about 9pm that night.  The service was friendly and prompt but our head waiter was a wee bit odd.  He'd come up to the table and just look at us....without saying anything.  The rest of the wait staff thankfully were normal and very kind.    They start you off with a variety of delicious  fresh baked bread and olive spreads - our favorite was the roll with cranberries and walnuts.  We had to control ourselves from filling up on the bread.  We shared the Belgium Endive salad and they were kind enough to split it into two separate plates.  Bosc pears  endives  pistachios and grilled brie - what a great mix of flavors.  He special ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and asked that it be prepared like the Salmon entree with the Salmon fixings and I had the Duck Two Ways.  They were very accommodating to his customized request and it came out fantastic. Both my pieces of duck were infused with flavor but I like my seared duck breast much better than the crispy confit leg.  We were stuffed up to our eyeballs but still devoured the Banana Tiramisu for dessert.  Everything was scrumptious.  I recommend dining here in warmer weather so you can enjoy your dinner out on the balcony under the heat lamps while enjoying the water show.  Now  that would have been pretty sweet.  Great all around spot for a date  special occasion or even a business or nice group dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Based on the reviews  I'd say we had an off experience. We had a casual late lunch here and we left underwhelmed. The bread basket they start you off with was decent. I had the burger  which was a little over-cooked (though still very juicy. The bun was a lot larger than the meat - perhaps it shrank due to being a overcooked. The fries are steak fries  which we enjoyed. Couldn't taste the cheddar cheese. Wife had the chicken sandwich which was uninspired. Chicken wasn't particularly juicy and the foccacia was middle of the road in our opinion. I give this review based on the Sandwiches being $16 each  which i feel is aggressive for what we got in return.  Nevertheless  decor and ambience is perfect. I can tell that what we got wasn't the restaurant's best. Given the reviews  I might give it another shot.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is long overdue.  My expectations for this restaurant were high as the name of the chef behind it warranted such expectations.  While Todd English is known for Mediterranean flavors  this restaurant by no means showed any of this besides the olive spread and bread we received in the beginning.  As I perused the menu  I was highly disappointed that it didn't feature more Mediterranean style food.    But alas  I ordered the steak and what came out of it was the sides were bigger than the steak itself.  It was a sad sight to witness.  Just because we are in Las Vegas  it shouldn't change a chef's roots.  All I saw in Las Vegas were a bunch of burgers and steakhouses opened by famous chefs known for other types of cuisine.  I shake my head at this cop out.  This is a MAJOR cop out.  At the end of the day  the food tasted alright but the smores panna cotta was a disaster.  I did not get the gooey taste of marshmallows nor the sweetness of the melted chocolate.  Like the dessert  the restaurant was equally a disaster in its own right.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,the bib salad was only ok. the onions were saggy  the amount of cheese was undetectable and the walnuts were not toasted. the portobello flat bread was overpowered with mushrooms and we could not taste the wild mushrooms or the truffle oil. we remember this restaurant when it was light and happy and the food was better. we will not return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"With the list of hot celebrity chef restaurants its hard to figure out where to eat first.   We were staying at the Bellagio and had been watching the MLife channel (I know who watches tv when in vegas) ANNNYYWAYY  they featured this restaurant.  Todd English is not an english place  which threw us off... in a good way.  We stopped by spontaneously bc we were pretty hungry.  We split the burger (which you need to try with truffle cheese)  It was very good.  The quality of the meat was excellent and well seasoned.   Even better  I found 'My Drink""!  Best drink I've had the whole trip... the two pear i believe it is called.  Minimal ingredients  and pear puree.  soooo good and not overly sweet (which I was afraid it would be)  Such a great drink.  It should be their signature.    Check out this place  I'm pretty sure you will enjoy the view and relaxed atmosphere"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,That view sitting in the Bellagio just makes everyone feel like they are a million bucks. The food was exquisite and pricey but you are paying for the view as well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had a really fantastic experience here-- great food and attentive service. It gets quite crowded at lunch time  so make sure you have reservations or come prepared to wait.  The must-have is the beef carpaccio. I don't even know how to describe it  but it's amazing. They're also known for their house-made pasta; the meatball pasta was really delicious. I didn't like the fish too much because the cilantro rice was bland and not that interesting. However  the fish itself was cooked perfectly. I would say to order the beef carpaccio and some kind of pasta and you're 100% sure to have a fabulous meal!  It could have been a 5 except two things: 1. the rice  and 2. they couldn't accommodate us for window seating even though we specifically requested it.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had a wonderful dinner last night. Sea Bass was the best I have ever had!!!!! Drinks were amazing too. Beautiful decor as well.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Truffle burger is LEGIT. Great view of the fountains too. Went here during lunch  wasnt too crowded. Worth a stop if you're in the hotel and get hungry
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ok let's try a straight to the point format :-)  Good food (not amazing) Slow service Very loud and busy NOT cheap by any means Can probably care less about my review cause they will remain busy
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We sat at the bar and the bartenders  Ernie and Jay were great. Friendly  patient  great since of humor and prompt. We sure will be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Hmm... Where to start.... It was a very pleasant experience overall! Service was very nice  speedy and attentive. Food was very nice... We had the flatbread with BBQ shredded beef  shared that as an appetizer... Also had the lobster carbonara fettuccine and the filled pork loin with root vegetables....flat bread was really  really Great!  As for my carbonara dish  the pasta was a bit to delicate but the rest of the dish was just melting in my mouth  very well balanced dish overall! The pork loin roulade was a bit dry  the sauce a bit too sweet and the root vegetables a bit to crunchy for my taste...but we cleaned both plates  it was too tasty to mention this  since it's all just in my opinion. BTW  loved the bread  tapenades and the olives! Thank you TEO team for a very nice experience... Definitely will go back :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great upscale atmosphere. Loved the bread with the olive tapenade. Shared Bibb salad with white onions and sprinkled with blue cheese  a walnut vinegarette dressing. I had the ravioli filled with pureed peas and fava beans smothered in mushrooms and more peas and fava beans. A white wine and butter sauce. If you love mushrooms  you'll love this.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,i went here on my last vegas trip and i have one word ..overrated..i mean the restaraunt itself its nice i think i mean i barely  could see in there..its so damn dark .. service was ok the food was ok but for the price should have been amazing.. everything for me was ok ....i would have expected something more considering its one of the nicer restaurants in vegas..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Meh. Dining room was super loud. We couldn't have a conversation without shouting.  I had the half ravioli and half butternut squash pasta. Read all the reviews and was excited to try. Just meh. The squash was watery and too sweet.  Hubs had the seafood risotto. I tried a bite and it was really fishy.  Won't be returning:(
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Fantastic night out with the ladies.  Would have loved a seat on the patio but we were too hungry to wait.  Great wine selection and great help from our server in picking out a bottle!  Kept it simple with a flatbread pizza!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We chose it because of its special location overlooking the Bellagio fountains.  This will be a restaurant I will return to every time I go to Vegas because of nostalgia.    Notice that I didn't give it 5 stars though.  Here is why- Our waiter was very inattentive.  After we were done with our meal  it took a long time and some flagging down to get our check.  Also  when I looked at our credit card bill later on  mysteriously our waiter was given $3 more tip than we had written on our receipt.  I am currently dealing with the credit card company with this issue.    Also  our reservation was at 10pm.  We had written as a note on the reservation that  we requested a seat on the patio.  Unfortunately  they didn't have a seat for us when we arrived.  We had to wait about 30 minutes for a seat on the patio- Not the biggest deal since the seat we did get was right on the railing!  The food was great! Food--- Dinner came with some great foccacia bread with olive spread- too bad we don't like olives.  Major Faux pas when I asked for butter!    We ordered the fig and prosciutto pizza for appetizer.  So unique!  Amazing!    For dinner we ordered 2 different pastas... A butternut squash tortellini and ricotta ravioli.  Both were great  but the tortellini was amazing!!!!!!    Oh  and did I mention the fountains.  Magical...
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Forget about the view  let's talk about what really matters!  Great meals  great specialty cocktails  great service...  Got a drink at the bar to start things off and as soon as our table was ready  the hostess graciously carried my drink to the table... (Thank god because I am clumsy as hell!)  Once seated  I could not decide between 2 dishes and the waiter told me I could do a ""half and half"" plate in order to taste both of the dishes I was eying. Awesome!   The food came and was DELICIOUS! Not an over sized portion  not a tiny ""fru-fru portion either  but rather just right...  And even though we did not sit outside (it was 8 pm and still way too hot)  we still had a pretty good view of the Bellagio fountain which was great.  So bottom line  if you want to sit outside and experience the fountain up close then definitely make the wait and sit out on the patio.  If you just  want a delicious meal  with air conditioning and a semi great view of the fountain  sit indoors. You will not regret it.   Oh and definitely make a reservation to be on the safe side  restaurant is not too big and is very popular..."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"THANK GOD!!! I have actually had a good meal on this god-forsaken TRIP!  Well it's no wonder because it's a Todd English establishment!    The service was on par with the food....excellent!  I planned a whole bachelorette weekend for my best friend and this was where I picked for our ""fancy night.""  I called in ahead of time and they had us in a private section of the restaurant just overlooking the beautiful dancing fountains of the Bellagio.  It felt like the real Lake Como experience (well  vegas-style LOL)   The prices are VERY reasonable for Vegas.  But you wouldn't know the difference when you try the food! PHENOMENAL!    To start  I had the heirloom tomato caprese stack. Delicious! For my entree I ordered the Brick Oven Roasted Free Range Chicken Breast with avocado puree  crispy fried polenta  roasted pepper butter sauce  radish sprouts  and watermelon vinaigrette. I savored every bite!    Our server was the cherry on top of this Todd English sundae!  His name was Russ and he made our experience more than just a meal.  He was patient with 6 of us girls and a true gentleman. He even serenaded the bride for us!! Adorable!  Then he surprised her with a plate of chocolate truffles with ""congratulations"" written in chocolate sauce!  The entire restaurant staff made it a point to stop by and welcome us to Olives. Special thanks to Russ  the best server EVER!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"So for my birthday I wanted to sit out by the Bellagio Fountains  so we chose to eat at here. I had read all these great reviews and heard good things  so I figured the food would be amazing. Not the case.  Good things - the service was amazing - the cocktails were exquisite (especially the ""Life is Fresh"") - the bread basket before the meal was wonderful - the chocolate cake and panna cotta  Bad things - every entree was gross (I can't think of another word) - the scallops were covered in a weird  thick brown sauce that ruined the dish - the sea bass tasted like water - the duck was overcooked and tough  I think the view is nice  and the service is great  but I wouldn't go back except for cocktails and desserts."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Believe it or not I come to this restaurant 2 days in a row! The food is so good I even missed it in my sleep!! The beef carpaccio is the best I ever had in my entire life!! The scallops were done perfect that I eventually ordered the same food!! It's a pity I live far away from here or else I would have come every week!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Las Vegas is the epiphany of dining options  with something for every palette at seemingly any time of day.  Sure  one can get ham and eggs for $1.99 in the Fremont Street district  but save that for the end of the trip when the dealer's gotten the better of you.  While you still have a few bucks in your pocket  splurge on yourself at Olives at the Bellagio.  The hotel housing Todd English's only west coast outlet is a spectacle in itself- go a little early to admire the artwork and gaming floor.  Yes  the gaming floor- classy doesn't even stop there.  But getting the right table at Olive's will give you a view that you'll still be talking about on the plane ride home- the Strip  of course  but a front seat view of the fountains from an entirely different angle.    The menu is largely seasonal  I understand  and may require a bit of study.  Think cruise ship menu- there's always something that you're not going to have one clue how to pronounce or  even if you do  you have no clue what it is.  But don't count it out- Coq au Vin (Coke-ahh-Vin) is actually chicken in a wine sauce  for example  and is delicious.  But I digress.  We ordered meat dishes  I the pork tenderloin with polenta and green beans  my cousin and steak.  They were both superb dishes that I can still taste if I close my eyes and focus.    The service was a little subpar- disappointing for a Todd English restaurant  in my opinion.  The sommelier seemed disappointed that we only ordered one glass of wine each.  And the wait staff probably assumed that two younger guys either weren't going to tip well or who knows what.  Despite my disappointment in the service  I remind myself that Olives is all about the food.    Overall  Olives is what it is- great food in a pleasant environment.  The wait staff was a slight misstep  but that could be the stigma of Las Vegas too.  Above all  don't let some slow service discourage a decision to enjoy this menu.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,What a breathtaking view when seated on the patio!  The gal and I were lucky as we got in just before the rush without a reservation.    Service was great from the moment we got in until we left.  Even had a manager ask us how everything was.    We had the foie gras for an appetizer--delish.  And I got the Duck Cooked 2-ways for my entree.  The sauce was good  the Moulard duck of excellent quality but it was a little dry--more past medium than the med-rare to medium that the server recommended.    Would've tried dessert but there wasn't anything that looked that extraordinary.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Ate here last week for dinner while on a quick trip to Vegas.  Overall  it was pretty good.  We started with the Crispy Tempura Prawns  which were quite tasty with the avocado cream.  I had the Butternut Squash Tortelli  which was delicious (although I was hoping for some textural contrast with the amaretti cookies)  and my husband had the Dry-Aged Ribeye.  It was also very good  but under his medium-rare order slightly.  The service was a little slow  but it was quite loud and busy the night we were there.  My only complaint would be the seating.  When I made the reservation  I had specifically requested seating on the patio.  When we arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation  and were told it would be at least an hour before a table on the patio would be available.  That said  we will still return next time we're in town.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I have been to Olives so many times I cannot count anymore. I have been to Vegas over a dozen times and Olives is my favorite spot in Vegas. I do not review many spots in Vegas  but I feel with some of the feedback I have seen  it is time to be real.  This is very good  quality establishment  with a solid reputation for food  where you do not have to be in a 3-piece suit and spend a minimum of $200 to dine here. Therefore  it will be a bit busy  crowded  and hectic  pretty much from the time the doors open until they shut them at night. This is usually a good sign.  I have never once been disappointed with the food. The grilled octopus is one of the best dishes I have ever had  and I dine in NYC often and have exposure to top notch food. If you can eat seafood  then you must try this dish. The bread and spreads you receive upon sitting down is great. The entrees are very tasty. I have had many  mostly daily specials  so I cannot pick a favorite  but you cannot go wrong.  Olives has an extensive wine selection. You should be able to find a bottle which is to your party's liking. The sommelier has been knowledgeable and friendly every time I have had a question about a selection.  Now  there is a bit of advice I have for anyone who wishes to dine on the patio facing the Fountains of Bellagio. Make a reservation. Get there before your reservation (20min plus). And ask if it is possible to wait for a table on the patio to open. THEY DO NOT guarantee a table then when you make your reservation. This should be obvious as to why  but some folks seem to forget that  the table you are looking to enjoy is probably a top ten  or even top 5  dining experience in Vegas. I have dined at Olives at least 10 times (AT LEAST) and all but one time I was able to get onto the patio with my parties (and this includes parties of 8+). The one time I wasn't  was due to a small wedding reception (and they probably paid a fine penny for that) which was being held early evening on a Saturday. A little savvy  a little understanding  and a little patience can go a long way.  The service has always been impeccable. My water was never more than 2/3 empty  the wait staff was around  and the server was never rude or ignored me or my guests. Yes  at times it took a few more minutes to get my food then 'normal' (whatever that is). But with the amount of folks usually in the restaurant  this should be expected and understood.  This establishment is one of the few finer dining establishments I would ever entertain giving 5 Stars on Yelp. So that's why I did. I highly recommend and I will return the next time I am in Sin City.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This was the worst meal I had in Vegas by far. It is a step above a diner but charges 3 times more. Just stay away!! The view of the fountains doesn't cost that much!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I went here for my birthday.  Very nice place.    The bread and olive paste they bring is very good (no surprise  given the name).  For an app  we had the margarita flatbread which was tasty.  My wife had the butternut squash tortelini.  She really liked and you can tell by the way the pasta was cut  it was made fresh (none of those predictable  pre-formed crescent shaped tortelini from a box).  I had the chicken and gnocci which was very good (and filling).    They have a very good wine and drink menu.    The service was outstanding.  They brought me a special desert free of charge.  It was standard for b-days but still very nice.    It is a bit pricey  however  so be prepared.  $193 for app  two entrees  a bottle of wine one cocktail  tax and tip (although I tip fairly well).    Overall  very nice experience at Olives!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"So  we arrange for a 2:30 reservation at Olives  and end up getting there a little closer to 3. Upon our arrival  we find out (unbeknownst to us) that the chefs leave at 2:45  so they are no longer serving lunch  but there is a one-page bar menu  consisting of mostly appetizers. We were disappointed  but hungry  and decided to accept  and requested a seat outside so we could sit by the fountains.   Despite NO ONE being outside  we were told that we were not allowed to sit outside. Upon asking why  we were told that it's closed except during lunch and dinner.  This made no sense to us  but we proceeded with the meal nonetheless.  We ordered appetizers and drinks  and saw a basket of bread and butter go by  and asked our waiter if we could have some bread. We were informed that bread was actually a MENU item  and came at a cost. I can't think of a time in my life that I've been at a restaurant that CHARGED for bread and butter. I was very put off by this.  So our food finally comes  and it was very good. I had the burger with carmalized onions  and it was very good. All in all  I was disappointed with the service  and general atmosphere of how this place was run ""between lunch and dinner."" I wouldn't go back there  despite the positive recommendations and quality food options."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It has been about a month since I ate at this restaurant but what a treat!  The service was great  we ate at the bar and the bartender was very helpful in stearing us in the direction of what we would enjoy the most.  He was very forthcoming with what was good and what was not so great.   I had good ol' steak and potatoes and it was made in a way that I had never experienced before but oh so good.  The Tuna Tar Tar was also exceptional.    The menu is varied and interesting I would recomend to anyone.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Okay  I know it's weird that I would give a 3-star for such nice restaurant in vegas locating in Bellagio.    I actually liked the environment because I were seated in the outside patio.  The view was super nice! It's very very pretty at night.  Don't worry about the cold weather because there were heaters outside.  The only sad thing about the night I was there because there was a little rain and it was super windy.  so I guess if you are planning to go  check the weather too!  I ordered the following plates: 1) Pan cake with Foie Gras steak $25 (again  if you know I'm a big fan of foie gras.  I give a-OK to this one.  It's not that I don't know it but it did not have the original taste.  But guess what  the mini pancake tasted really special and i love it!)  2) Escargot - $18 (hmm... i don't recommend this.  sorry)  3) tuna tartare - $18 (no..... don't order this.  it was just plain tuna sashimi (i think it was not marinated) and some cucumber in the bottom..... If you are in the SGV area   please go to La Grande Orange Cafe in Pasadena for the tuna tartar only $14)  4) Lobster Pasta - $41 (a big disappointment.  I'm sorry to say I didn't like it.  I saw many people recommended this and it's about lobster so I gave a try.  Failed.  It was a big ""plate"" with a little portion of pasta and two pieces of lobster.  The lobster tasted like it's only boiled.  The sauce to the pasta was okay but for $41... I was hoping for more.)  5) Lemonade - $6 (it tastes different and was good.  But $6 I think it was overpriced)  The service was okay  not at my expectation.  The view  again  super nice  despite of the weather.  We took some photos there and the server was nice enough to help us take one photo.    The total bill came out around $115 which is quite expensive to me.. but the good thing is I have $60 from my mlife credit so I only had the pay the rest.  So don't forget your mlife card.  If you gamble  use it to pay!! heheh   My tip is make reservation ahead of time.  Go around at 6PM before the peak time.   If you are like me  prefer bigger portion of food... maybe it's not really a good place to try.  But if you like to enjoy the view and enironment and not about the food  there you go  a must try!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is such an amazing place! Fantastic food  incredibly attentive staff  and  if you're close enough to the window  a great view! We were there when they were only serving 'bar' food  and we almost kept walking. I'm so happy we stayed. The squid was really spectacular and the mushroom flatbread was excellent. The waiter was so nice and professional.. he recommended drinks and also helped us with the food selection without being pushy. If we'd been in Vegas for a bit longer  we would have gone back to Olives for lunch or dinner!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Love the beat salad! Love the lobster roll! Make reservations  one of my favorite spots for lunch. Impeccable service and a fountains view.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend and I decided to try Olives for my birthday which happened to fall on a Monday. We had a reservation so there wasn't a wait but the restaurant was very busy. It was extremely dark inside and very noisy  which took away from the experience I found. The food was better than average  I had the beef tenderloin and he had the salmon which was great. Loved the bread basket  onion bread was delicious! Overall I think it was a good experience. If I could've heard my boyfriend speak over the other chatter then it would've been ideal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Erica couldn't seat us in our time frame but she went out of her way to call another restaurant and put our name on the list right away.  Wonderful customer service on a very busy weekend.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Came recommended by a friend but the food was really poor. Don't bother.  I'm not sure how this place has a good score on Yelp. The service is odd  too many people try to get involved with your table and none of them are particularly helpful or useful! The food was very average/poor.  My espresso martini cocktail was excellent  the best of its kind I've ever had. When we came to order wine a strange lady approached us  asked if we needed help then  after we said we thought we would order the Riesling we had seen on the menu   proceeded to talk about the fact they had Riesling while looking across the room at other tables the whole time. Very odd and completely useless.  A gentleman came over  told us all about the 3 types of water they do and brought us tap after we asked for that. He frequently topped up our water glasses  far more than was necessary and to the point where it was annoying to have him lean over us every couple of minutes. The bread basket was ok. One of the breads was strangely sweet and not nice  the others were just alright. The olives and tapenade were just about edible  nothing special and not particularly pleasant  some of the olives were quite bitter.  The mains came out with a side of zucchini that I'd ordered. This was stone cold so I sent it back. It was replaced but so slowly that we'd finished our food by the time it came out but they still charged us for it! Such poor service. My main of butternut squash pasta was no better than any high street Italian restaurant but much more expensive. The plate was cold meaning the food was lukewarm and the kitchen hadn't bothered to wipe the splashes of sauce off the edges so the whole thing looked messy. The hazelnut biscotti crumbled on top gave the dish an unpleasant sweetness.  They then brought us an small plate of profiteroles (3 tiny things) as a 'treat' for our honeymoon. These were dry and tasteless  we had been planning to order desserts but this put us off and we just left.  Do not go to this restaurant it's really substandard for the price. Maybe I had too high expectations for Vegas in general. I can't believe what rubbish they get away with serving here and charging for!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My go to place when I need that Yumm in my life. Accompanied by the beautiful fountain show and nice atmosphere. Heaven. Great prices for an upscale restaurant. Great service. Great food.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Just wow! This place is upscale and gorgeous. Definitely dress up for this place and don't wear jeans. You'll feel a little out of place in this charming restaurant. All day  but even better in the evening  you can watch the Bellagio fountains dancing away if you're sitting near the windows or out on the terrace. Olives comes with complimentary bread squares with some sort of carmelized onion on top. With it comes two different olive spreads (green&black) as well ad whole olives themselves. Personally I thought the black olive spread was better than the green  the green is too salty for me   Save a little bread for your entree so you can sponge up the BUTTERNUT SQUASH TORTELLINI! This was so good I was sinning and making noises. The tortelli was sweet  not heavy and just the right amount; the sauce was buttery and salty to compliment the tortelli. It may not look like a lot  but it will stuff you!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very good! We were not super hungry so our fabulous server Stephanie suggested we share the Carpaccio. GREAT Recommendation! Wine was perfectly paired  and she made sure we were all paid and out the door in time for our show. Highly recommended.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Had been here before with better experiences  hopefully this was just a one-time fiasco. Hostess friendly  sat us outside  watched fountains  all good so far. Waiter during entire stay acted like he didn't have the time to wait for us to answer silly questions like what we would like to eat. Then  warning  the nice outdoors area becomes a lot less nice when everybody starts lighting up as for whatever atmospheric and architectural reasons that would explain this  smoke just stays in the little cove of the tables instead of dissipating. My meal tasted good  but it gave me food poisoning :(  Update: General manager tracked me down and she seemed genuinely concerned about the shortcomings of that night  so a refreshing plus for that.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Wine list was superb and the views from the balcony overlooking the Bellagio pond and waterfalls are breathtaking. The staff and manager were delightful and treated us like we were high rollers. Highly recommended.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. They don't have an expansive menu  but you'd be hard-pressed to find something you don't like among the choices. The scallops are always delicious  and when one of my friends got a load of their marinara sauce he swore that it was the best he's ever tasted. I also love the assortment of olive spreads that accompanies the bread.  It's a little pricey  but still very reasonable compared to a lot of other spots on that section of the strip. Eating alongside the Bellagio fountains is a nice treat as well  but if you're seated outside then be careful. You just might get a little wet. :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Service: 5/5 Free bread and olive appetizer: 5/5 Charcuterie board: 5/5 Ambience 5/5  I really really liked this place. The view from the deck is one of the best views of manmade objects on planet earth.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Didn't stay. Hostess took us  without warning  outside to the only table without shade and then waited around to come back and say ""oh is this too hot?"" Very unfriendly."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,LOVED this place! my friend recommended this place since i was looking for restaurants to eat at in vegas... we had lunch reservations and this is what we ordered  appetizer: Beef carpaccio - polenta  roquefort crema  shaved parmesan  cipollini onions (excellent! good size for 2 people.  the meat and the sauce was a good combination)   entree: Pan seared jumbo sea scallops - with mushroom risotto and arugula salad with crispy onions (excellent! the sea scallops were cooked perfectly! couldn't ask for more... the mushroom risotto was a perfect match with the scallop)  entree: catch of the day - chilean sea bass (cooked perfectly! not overcooked or undercooked! the portion was just right so it doesn't make you feel stuffed!)   they also provide bread/flat breads with 2 different olive spreads (very good)   we were so full that we didn't even get dessert... it's a must-go-to place in vegas
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,omg.. my husband and i enjoyed this place so much and he doesn't really like italian stuff. i wanna go here again the nxt time i come back. it's fancy and lots to choose from :)
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,The service here was amazing. The food and cocktails are great! Get a seat outside and try the caprese salad!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and I decided on this as a lunch one day when we were trying to figure out a place to eat.  We were glad we did.   We arrived shortly after they opened at 11am  and were promptly seated with a choice of either the balcony overlooking the Bellagio Fountains or the dining room.  We chose the dining room as it was very sunny that day.    Our server  Dennis  was very attentive and made was able to answer any questions that we had about the menu.    We chose the Manila Clams Fra Diavolo for my wife and I chose the Short Rib Pappardelle.  Both came out very quickly and were very fresh and flavorful.  Service was wonderful  and we never felt rushed at all.  I definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking  for a nice quiet meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We had reservations for 6 guest at 7 on a Sunday  once there I requested a patio table but the wait would push us back till 9:15. All of the group had tickets to various shows so we opted for a table inside. To our surprise we got the best table in the place. We had a wonderful view of the strip and the fountain show. (Bonus points while I went to get our O tickets from the box office at the Bellagio the hostess sat our party  which usually doesn't happen unless everyone is there to be seated) Our waiter was gracious and patient  always very polite about any requests we had. Everyone at the table enjoyed their dinner. I had the Filet Mignon Oscar  which I ordered medium. It came a little more on the rare side but was so delicious. ( Side note I had a friend whose steak was also a little more rare than usual  so my guess is that is how the steaks are cooked here...) My husband got the chicken finished the plate  even though he said he wasn't hungry when we got there. When I made reservations I was asked if we were celebrating anything  I did mention it was my husband's 25th birthday trip  so after dinner they brought out a small dessert that read Happy Birthday. I thought it was nice  and my husband liked that they didn't make a big fuss.. like sing.   I would definitely go back on our next trip to Vegas.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My wife and 2 of our friends ate here on 9/19/11  the last night of our Vegas vacay.  We had patio seating  and while the view of the water show was great  the food was a huge disappointment.  We started with the calamari and mushroom flatbread.  Came out promptly and tasted good but both could've used a little less salt.  My wife and one of our friends had with the butternut squash tortelli.  Neither tasted good (sauce seemed to taste of beef stock) and both were sent back.  I had the short ribs which were extremely dry and tough as if they had been sitting in the window for a while (which they likely did considering it took our entrees close to an hour to come out).  The fourth member of our group was the only one happy with his entree.  He ordered the steak special  which according to him and his wife was great.  Overall an extremely disappointing meal...at least the view was good and our server took both tortelli's off the bill.  Will not be back on our next Vegas vacay.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is a great location for a romantic evening or just  a night to gather with friends and take in the fountains of Bellagio. The added feature to this dining experience is that you could make reservations to dine on the outside patio that over looks the fountains. I would recommend making reservations.   The evening started off with a basket of bread and three various olive spreads. Now I don't do olives but I had to try it especially with this being my first time here. I tried the dark jam like spread which was really good. I didn't really care for the other spreads since it had a really strong olive spread.   Our server was awesome very friendly and really was the driving for in our experience. I was tossed between the Salmon and the Chicken and after speaking to the server I ordered the chicken which was set on top cream mashed potato with side of green beans and with some greens with a lite vinaigrette dressing. My friend had the same dilemma between the two ravioli dishes that they have. The server recommended getting a 1/2 and 1/2 order.   WOW!! That's all I have to say the chicken dish was awesome. The chicken was moist and filled with flavor. The greens with the dressing was a nice touch. I took a bite of my friends ravioli dish and wow it just melt in your mouth it was de...licious... I will have to try a full plate of that next time I go.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing Rose. Amazing tenderloin beef steak. Amazing service. Amazing tapenade/specialty olives. Hands down amazing.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,4 stars for the kick ass bartender who took care of us.  Too bad i forgot his name.  Great service  good menu  vibrant and lively location.  Don't worry about the prices  just order and enjoy!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,One of the most unique dining experiences you can have. ... Terrific food  great service and a table next to the Bellagio fountains?  It doesn't get any better.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,It was hard for me to decide how many stars to give this place so three it is. The restaurant is the place to go to if you want to ooh and ahh at the Bellagio Fountains and feel fancy while you are sipping on your wine/cocktail/beer and eating your overpriced Vegas meal. I live here and have seen it many times. Also  we didn't dine during the fountains schedule. From what I saw  there were five tables with a frontal view and maybe ten other tables behind those five tables in the small patio area. My group and I sat indoors that day.  They start you off with three types of complimentary bread and parmesan crisps with olives  black olive tapenade  and green olives tapenade. I'm not a big olives fan. I have tried it many  many times too. I just don't like olives. I'm not taking off any stars for that because I don't think it's fair to judge a food you know in advance that you don't like.  We ordered a bunch of items and sampled each other's dishes. I really like the Zucchini Crisps. I thought it seemed more of a bar food item and not a fancy food though but I couldn't stop eating them. The Chilean Sea Bass was out of this world. The fish was cooked perfectly  seasoned right  and melted in my mouth. The seared sea scallops were delicious as well. Some of the dishes were OK but not something I would order again. The butternut squash tortelli seemed more like a dessert to me due to its sweetness. The lobster scampi with squid ink is not my cup of tea. The desserts were sufficient and good enough. Nothing extraordinary  just something to appease your sweet tooth.  OK  here comes the gripes. My friend noticed there was a fruitfly in my drink which I already had drank out of. Gross. We told the waitress and no apologies or nothing comped. I didn't make a big deal out of it but I was thinking at least say sorry or something.  She replaced the glass (well hoping she did). Later  everyone got refills but me. I was slightly put off by this so couldn't give this place 4-5 stars.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I was totally bored with everything in this place. The service was so so  the food was so so and unfortunately we didn't get a good view seat so the dining room was so so.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,WOW!  Olives at the Bellagio deserves the highest star rating possible!   Aside from the outstanding food and service  the strip view and outdoor seating next to the dancing fountains was unbelievable!   Definitely stands out as one of the best of Vegas experiences.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Drinks and food were great!  Atmosphere and service were lacking.  When you are paying top dollar for it you don't need to be crammed in a corner and then have strangers sitting one foot from you.  Will not be returning even though food was pretty outstanding.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I agree with the reviews on here that say the dishes are very hit or miss. What a bummer this place has major potential  maybe they should rethink the size of their menu. It made up for it I guess when the dishes really hit because I love American Italian done right.   We had just arrived from the airport with a big group of friends  we couldn't wait to get in grab a nice cold drink and lots of food. Our waiter came  seemed like a decent guy until after we got the drinks. One of the drinks was mixed dreadfully  everyone tried to confirm how awful and inedible it was. When we simple asked for it to be made again  the waiter claimed he personally tried every drink he served and it was made correctly. I couldn't believe what I was hearing  did this guy really just tell me he had time to personally taste test every drink that he waited on? Wtf dude.    Ah  weird twist in the night. The food was kinda boring. The service is blah.   Had a super fun time but only because we had a fun group of friends that could have been anywhere.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Grilled octopus and squid appetizer on a bed of garbanzo beans with a classic Mediterranean sauce was excellent. Tuna carpaccio was so and so by itself but married with crispy wonton skin and the med sauce was good. The artichoke chicken flatbread was excellent also. Just a wonderful mix of chicken  artichoke  cheese  spinach and the bread itself... Really good. Beef tenderloin was beautiful. Though it was blanketed by greens  the tasty  tender  cooked-to- perfection beef tenderloin was outstanding. Paired with carrots  silky white gravy  and I don't know what else  just made everything taste great! And the salmon.... What else can I say  it was outstanding as well. This restaurant is Vegas great!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Nothing memorable.  We were craving some foie gras and yelped pulled this restaurant.  It was good (isn't it always?  :P) but the other items we ordered were whatever.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Very disappointed. Extremely poor service and mediocre food. Even the hostess stand was unprofessional. Salad was served wilted and very over dressed. Never saw waiter after salad was delivered to check on us.  When he cleared our plates he never inquire why the salad was nearly untouched. Will never return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Do not eat here.  Food is terrible for the price  they do not honor reservations like ""normal"" restaurants  drinks are over priced.  We espected to may $75-$100 per person  but we also expected amazing food.  This was not the case.    Forget about outdoor dining  if want this  plan to wait 2 hours even if you have reservations.    Like I said  forget about this place."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great service and great food. Had seating right on the terrace with a beautiful view of the fountains. Definitely recommend this place.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I will be very careful and selective with what i say because I have only eaten here  once  and very rarely will i review a place unless i have 3 experiences. I don't think I will ever eat there again so I decided that I will review it now based on my experience. Here my run down:  I think I set my expectations too high because I enjoy Todd's other restaurants so much (Kingfish and Tuscany) But after having an amazing meal the night before at Scarpetta i realized that Todd English cannot shake a stick at Scott Conant and maybe that makes me biased.   Service- From hostess and waiter; TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. You should be ashamed of yourselves  your water guy/ busser out shined you by far. I wish I could remember your name but man oh man get your head out of your ass and serve the people!  Food- Bread and olive tempanade was terrific. But that's where the meal fizzled. The scallops and risotto was over ambitious and the Diver scallops we FAR from fresh. The waiter only said 3 words the whole night and two of them were Tuna Tar tare. Well i have 2 words for you buddy: TRY AGAIN. It was lacking texture  flavor and complexity you would expect from a $30 appetizer. That's all I have to say about that.  Ambiance- Ehh romantic efforts with obnoxious tourist loudness  Overall- Wont be back  Todd sorry you didn't win my heart over this time.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"My dinner here last night was probably my most disappointing dinner experience in Vegas - ever. And I am here 1-3 times per year. It really ruined my whole evening and while it was obvious I was unhappy  no one cared to ask why.   We started with the Beef Carpaccio. Good portion  and tasted good. The only decent thing about the night.  Entrees finally came  I had Seafood Risotto and husband had scallops.  The seafood risotto dish was cold! Other than the sauce on the risotto which was lukewarm all the bits of seafood were room temperature. Not chilled  but just cold. It felt they put my plate together from a steam table that wasn't working properly. The sauce was also very bland and the lobster in the dish was severely overlooked. So as I decide that I'm not going to eat it and send it back  the waiter does a quick ""drive by"" while my mouth is full of bread and my back is facing him  (he doesn't even make eye contact) so I don't get a chance to tell him to take it back. He's gone. And he was very un-attentive so we don't see him again until my husband is done with his food. No one was around to help!  When he returned I had taken about 3 tiny bites and he clears the plates  and doesn't even ask why I didn't eat. He quickly comes and goes. My husband's scallops were fine. Warm at least. Sauce was very rich. Nothing bad but nothing special.  We both left very dissatisfied with the service and overall food quality. Too many great choices in Vegas. This is not one of them."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Todd English's Olives has it all - good service  good food and a goooood location!!   I made reservations for 10 people to Olives super last minute (the week before) for a Saturday at 5:30 pm and they were very accommodating of our group  even though I added two people to the reservation at the very last minute! Keep in mind that although the patio seating for the Bellagio fountain would be amazing  they really can't make room for a huge group there. Also  they will hold your reservation for 15 minutes only!  I ended up sharing a couple (pretty hefty sized) appetizers with the girls. The beef carpaccio recommended by Jenny J. was humongous and so good! The meat was definitely fresh and high quality and it covered a mound of crispy polenta. It was topped with parmesan and some greens meaning every single bite had a little bit of everything - super delicious and highly recommended as an appetizer!  I also ordered the crab fritters which was very generous with the crab meat. It had a more Mexican food taste with avocado and a corn salsa type teal on top if it. Also recommended!  All in all this was a great place to kick off a bachelorette weekend. I think I will always remember sitting by the gates to Bellagio and people stopping by to yell ""Don't do it!!!!"" to the bride! Classy  delicious...I just may be back!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Was not impressed at all with the food or service. Started off with a peach Bellini. Not amazing at all. Ordered 3 appetizers. The beef carpaccio  mussels and caprese salad. I was disappointed in the flavors of all of them. Will not return.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,My boyfriend took me to dinner here for my 26th birthday. We were seated on the patio with an amazing view of the Bellagio fountain show.  They even let us move closer when a small table was available.  I started my meal with a cocktail  the Lychee Blossom  and it was definitely flowery... a little too floral for my taste.  The bread and cracker basket was alright; it was fun to taste the different tapenades and olives that came with it.  We had the infamous Beef Carpaccio  which was really saucy but tasty nonetheless.  We also tried the grilled octopus dish  served with chickpeas and tomatoes  which was also tasty.  My boyfriend had the shortrib with a truffle fried egg and I had the butternut squash tortelli.  I had a bite of his short rib  which was alright...but I've had better. My tortelli was good  but a bit sweet.  We ordered some corn/polenta dish that was a little weird.  We usually love polenta but this had fresh corn mixed in and it kind of threw the texture off for me.  The garlicky spinach (compliments of the chef  I guess) was really good.  We ordered the lemon tarts for dessert (I LOVE lemon desserts) but I was  a little disappointed when it arrived.  3 little store-bought tart shells (I work pastry in a kitchen...so I know the brand) with a bit of raspberry puree and runny lemon curd sloppily spooned in  topped with over whipped cream and some pretty candied lemon rounds.    They also sent out their salted caramel cheesecake  which sounded good  but needs just a little bit of work (I enjoy salty-sweet desserts  but this one was a tad heavy on the salt).   Bottom Line:  It was a nice birthday dinner.  The weather was nice enough to sit outside (keep in mind it was the beginning of November) and the Bellagio fountains were  beautiful.  The food itself was so-so considering the amount that I can assume he payed.  I would come back for lunch if I was in the area just to have the carpaccio  but I do not think I'd come back for a full blown dinner.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Todd English  you had me at flatbread. That flatbread special you had the night I went there smothered in three or four types of cheeses and onions was true perfection. My brother doesn't even like fancy food  but he found himself in love with that flatbread! I wish I had your flatbread cookers in my house so I could have one of these every day even though then I would need to go to the gym twice as much! Mmmmm cheese....  I also got to try one of your pasta special dishes too which came with all kinds of seafood piled amongst all of the noodles and in this tomato based sauce that was so flavorful. After the flatbread though I barely had room to finish this dish and be able to walk to my fancy vegas show afterward! Everything in that dish was perfect though. And my mom and brother were both happy with their dishes too!  But the reason for a star knocked off was a) our waiter decided to take his sweet times at some points with bringing us our drinks b) for staying in the bellagio and this restaurant being in the bellagio and us making our reservation through the hotel we kind of expected to have a table with a better view...Our view was of the fancy shopping stores outside of the restaurant and really as fun as it is to look at escada normally  I would have liked to be able to focus on my food a bit more. Especially if I could have gotten a view of the fountains instead... c) our mixed drinks were just so so in my opinion. Not sure if it was because of our waiter being slow  so maybe some drinks got diluted  but they could have been a little better.  But Todd  as I said in the beginning  you and flatbreads really do have a beautiful beautiful thing together  so don't change a thing about that!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,We made reservations because we were seeing the cirque show at the Bellagio! We were treated like royalty from beginning to end by Paul our waiter. We were definitely impressed. We are nurses so that is hard to do to impress us. He allowed us time and space and to go at our own pace. While the food was wonderful it was enhanced dramatically by this gentleman. At the end he insisted on a phone I handed him mine and he took our pictures without being asked. What a great way to end the first part of our evening.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Amazing brunch here yesterday  Tuna Carpaccio  seared Sea Scallops  and stuffed Prawns were our choices along with Bloody Marys  Chablis  and Espresso Martinis = HEAVEN. Service was excellent as well as the views of the water show. It is a must visit.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I don't usually like to eat olives  but the olives they served with my bread were delicious!!  They have foie gras on their menu which I really wanted to try  but I opted for the grilled squid and octopus since my husband doesn't like squid or octopus and this was my opportunity to have some.  While I enjoyed the squid  I didn't like the octopus.  It was too soft and I could tell it was boiled to the point where it had no taste.  Honestly  I don't mind the chewiness of squid or octopus so I think they over did it trying to make it not tough.  But what I really loved was their chestnut ravioli.  It was so delicious in it's reduced brown butter sauce.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,If I could leave more stars  I would. Gorgeous restaurant overlooking the fountains at the Bellagio. On the pricier side  but well worth it. Ambience is appropriate for a romantic date  but also suitable for a large group (like mine). We had a group of 10 and everyone was very pleased with their meals. Combine that with some of the friendliest and welcoming staff  and you've got a really outstanding evening. I highly recommend the beef carpaccio -- but beware that it is rather large for an appetizer  large enough to be a main course in my opinion. I ordered the portobello flatbread in addition  and was too full from the carpaccio to make a real dent in it. Although  the couple pieces I had were excellent. Others raved about the scallops -- they looked delicious.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Overall  food was good but nothing exceptional. We ordered lamp Chops (45$) and their famous fig flat bread. I am a die hard fan of lamb chops but was not fascinated by their at all. Flat bread was ok but again  nothing crazy. Ambiance was good esp is you sit outside overviewing Bellagio's water show.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I love this restaurant which is in the Bellagio.  You can eat inside or outside overlooking the water  which is great when they have the water fall show.  Ok so this restaurant is best for lunch  the ambience is quaint  beautiful colors  chandliers and candles.  They start you off with green and black olive tapanade with breads to dip in.  Soo good!!!  I would recommend the flat breads  no matter which one you choose  it will be fresh  earthy and very filling.  Def make a stop at Olives  they are even in NYC  which is great for me.  But Vegas calls me once a year and Olives will be seeing me again for a fantastic lunch.  Yummy tapanade and flat breads here I come.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We made reservations for five to make the ""O"" show.  We arrived at 450 in hopes of getting a drink  we were told to get in line .... At 512 pm we were seated once seated it took ten minutes before a server showed up. My wife's seafood risotto was less than par. The took a few bites and ended up not touching it at no point did the server ask how it was nor offered to replace it. My pork chop was good.   This was the first dinner in Vegas we didn't feel like it was worth the money   the service was also less than what we have come to expect in Vegas  Will not go back"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,When you have the opportunity to sit on the patio  Olive's is hands-down one of the best Vegas experiences. The restaurant is trendy and romantic  but still great for larger parties. We dined with two other couples (six total) during restaurant week and the menu with wine pairings was great. I ordered off the menu and enjoyed a perfectly cooked Sea Bass that was to die for; however  it's really the atmosphere with the Bellagio fountains in the background that won me over. I recommend saving this for a late(r) dinner when you can really enjoy the fountains and the vegas strip as it's backdrop!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,They have delicious vegan gluten free options! Incredibly accommodative. Thank you for a great food experience
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Olives lived up to everything we hoped it would be. The food  drinks and ambiance were perfect. We had the cheese and meat board to start which were great. The Gnocchi and Fig and Prosciutto flat bread were to die for! Add the view of the fountains and it's perfect!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I've dined here several years ago and remember it being amazing. We went for dinner last night. Let's just say my favorite part of the dinner was the olive spread we received.  My husband got the prime-- the sauce ruined everything. It was bitter and awkward.  I got the gnocchi-- a dish a frequently order. It was too soft and didn't have any taste. I picked through the dish and ate the olives and tomatoes.  I won't be returning. Very disappointed.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This is a highly rated fine dining establishment. I decided to come here for lunch since prices can be a bit high for dinner and I had been wanting to try this place out for years now ever since I was in high school!   Well  it was pretty busy that day  but luckily  we were seated next to the windows to get a good view of the Bellagio fountains. Our waiter was really friendly and had given us what he thought were the best choices for our meals.   The bread basket had a nice assortment and there a black and green olive dip on the side for them. I'm a bread and butter kind of gal so it wasn't really to my taste.   I chose the Dungeness crab salad for our appetizer and it was absolutely delightful! I shared it with my date and he loved it too. We both ordered the chicken for our meals and it was a bit dry. It came with green beans and I really didn't like that at all. I would've preferred asparagus  spinach  or broccoli. Definitely not green beans.   The bill was really expensive. We didn't even order cocktails and it was close to $100. Way too much for our meal.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I'm going to try to make this as simple as possible :)   ***********Pros*************** The starter bread was great with the delicious spread given. There were two olive puree dips and whole unpitted Olives....I put that on even my main entree! (Photo Provided)  They have cool touchscreen menus!! (Photo Provided)  Our waiter was very kind and prompt! I wish i remembered his name to write it here.   The meal we ordered was Tuna Tartare (Excellent!)  Beef Carappachio (Well Made and Yummy for my first time trying it) and Prime Tenderloin w/ Tempura Asparagus and Crab Cakes (Most interesting  and  Taste was GREAT overall). I've never had big slices of onions carmelized inside the mashed potatoes before which were Awesome!  (Photo Provided)  The presentation of their cocktails were most delicious looking. I ordered the Pineapple Doli was absolutely delicious! The foam on top reminded me  a lil' of the Dole Whip Factory from my previously visit to Oahu  HI. (Photo Provided)  The only mentioned that we were celebrating our First Anniversary was on Opentable.com  I wasn't sure if they got the message but the end of our meal they were soo kind enough to bring us a creme puff dessert with ""Happy Anniversary"" handwritten perfectly in chocolate to enjoy! That was seriously the highlight of our wonderful experience here! (Photo Provided)  ************Cons:*************** They have tables indoors and outdoors with the view of the  Bellagio Fountain Show. We made reservations for 5:15pm  (restaurant opens at 5pm) requesting this but a couple SERIOUSLY ONE minute before us got this special view table! DARNN!!!  Oh well.....If you guys want an amazing view table  you should definately try the outdoors ones available. It was 115 degrees this weekend so No thank you for us this time. Not the restaurant's fault at all......(Photo Provided)  My Prime Tenderloin wasn't cooked to the ""Medium Rare"" as requested  but more Medium more.  Just two small cons....I count those as not so important overall!!"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I went in a group of 10 on our 2nd night in Vegas.  Our group consisted of mostly New Yorkers and LA mid-20-somethings - so we're used to good food and over-hyped food.  To start  it was extremely difficult for us to choose a place as a group because the ""nice"" restaurants in Vegas are just a sister/brother restaurant to some restaurant in NYC  LA  or Chicago.  To find a place that we all have never been to was difficult.  Oddly enough the one we decided on finds its home in Boston where all of us all met (in College).  We made reservations and upon arriving there  our table was ready.  Points. As soon as we sat down (though our party was not complete)  the waitress was ready to take drink orders.  Points again.   When I ordered a dirty martini with blue cheese olives - the olives came skewered by a fig branch with pimento olives on the side. Points (I love olives).  One of the girls wanted to have some blue cheese olives - so i asked for another skewer - the waitress said it's $2.50 PER OLIVE...  HUH?!?! EXCUSE ME?? PER OLIVE?!? So like Vegas right?  Negative Points! But then the waitress was able to bring me an extra skewer on the sly. Major Points.    The food portions are A LOT bigger than she makes it seem.  I'm not sure if it's all the money the gambling folk lose that makes them come in with extreme stomachs.  I'm not sure if it's more that we were planning a long night out and had to save room for copious amounts of liquor.  But the portions were huge.  My best friend and I shared 3 appetizer plates.  The tuna tartare was HORRIBLE. I mean I couldn't find a single person to eat it at the table after one bite.  The tuna was used as the boats to ship large barrels of sesame oil into my mouth.  I could taste NOTHING but sesame oil.  Luckily  the rest of the food was good.  The Beef Carpaccio was AMAZING.  It was giant.  I think the two of us could have ordered that and it would have been plenty.  It is thinly cut and beautiful.  There's a mound of a frisee/arugula salad in the middle but it sits UNDER the thinly sliced layers of beef so you don't know what it is until you cut into the pieces.  Fun surprise :)  We also had the duck and truffle flatbread.  Again.  It was a large order.  It was amazingly delicious but it was large.  I must say. I am always nervous to order Dirty Martini's because every bartender makes it differently - but it was ON POINT. One of the best I've ever had.  I actually had 2 - a rarity these days as I stay away from vodka.  We were all SO full after this.  We all ate WAY more than we planned and to be honest - it sort of made the rest of the night difficult as it gave all of us massive food comas.  We were probably the most depressing group of girls to sit at the vip table in Prive EVER as we couldn't MOVE from eating such a giant heavy meal.  But hey  at least now all the yelpers know that it's a lot of food and it's THAT yummy. :)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,This place was highly recommended but honestly was a disappointment. The service was good  but the food was not worth the price. I ordered the seafood risotto and I was not able to eat the arborio rice as it was undercook and had no flavor at all. The carpaccio was very good and the only dish we had that was worth it. The pork chops were very dry. The view is beautiful  but food lacks taste. I don't mind paying for good food  but this was a waste. Will not be going back as there are so many better options around.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Yowsa!  If you are worried about doing the fine dining thing and leaving hungry  leave your worries at home!  We generally order 2 things to share  and this time we both wanted to steal each other's plates.  She had the raviolis and I had the seabass.  After eating Tao's seabass religiously I was skeptical  but omg omg.  Not sure how to even describe it really.  It has a nice crust on it  over risotto  heavenly.  In the rotation for sure..
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Great food! Waiter was awesome great view of the fountains if you sit outside.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Went here a while back for dinner.  Without exception that staff was rude and condescending.  From the hostess to the waitress and water boy  all acted like they were doing us a favor  I don't think one of them ever smiled.   We had the free range chicken which came on the plate swimming is some thin broth.  Looked and tasted exactly like boiled chicken  bleck!  Also ordered ravioli  got three ravioli in a thin watery light red sauce  bland  tasteless.  Will NEVER be back.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Reservations are strongly advised!  This place was packed  even at 10pm on a Sunday night on memorial day weekend.  If you come here for dinner  you MUST dine on the terrace at night to get an unobstructed view of he Bellagio Fountains and the vegas strip.  Unfortunately  you can only request the terrace once you check in and will most likely be placed on a wait list.  If this happens  go play some blackjack or craps  because it is worth the extra wait time.  The food was good  but not outstanding.  My husband and I shared a salad  sausage flatbread  and their ravioli with lobster.  I have to admit  the ravioli dish was delicious and different - somewhat sweet with corn essence.  It was also made with fresh spring peas which I am always a sucker for.  Anyway  I highly recommend this dish!    Overall  food was good and the view is AMAZING!!
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"I ate here when it first opened (that is  when Bellagio first opened) a zillion years ago and it was spectacular then. This week I finally had the opportunity to come back. I brought a very choosy eater with me  but I had scoped out the menu in advance and figured there'd be enough variety to make both of us happy.  Service was attentive  but a little detached - not really warm. That's OK  I mean it's Vegas  I'm not there to make friends  but the other places where I ate  the servers managed a little friendliness.  Seating was not as tight as it is in some other places  but they do bunch together all the table-for-two diners so we're practically in each others' laps. Wouldn't be too bad if peoples' behavior was uniformly civilized  but naturally that's not the case so you might end up with an undesirable dining ""companion"" from the next table staring at every forkful you put into your mouth.  ANYWHO. You came here to read about the food  not the other person there  who you probably will never run into anyway! Well I started with the Bibb salad which was overly oniony for most people  but perfect for me. My own dining companion ate most of our shared bucket of bread - there were four different varieties  with two pieces of each  and an olive and tapenade plate to spread on them. Rich  salty  saucy - a great starter.  For our entrees  I got the scallops on a truffle-mashed potato bed  starting out nutritiously-conscious enough by diligently eating all of the sauteed sea greens first  but then dropped the act and over my own but-I-really-shouldn't protests I licked the whole melty truffly scallopy plate clean. The scallops were like perfectly broiled butter-pats of the sea  not an iota of rubbery or chewiness. High marks.  My companion developed an epic inability to make a decision  suffering a choice-freeze of Shakespearean proportions  so he ended up ordering three sides instead of an entree: A side of lobster tail (oh em gee  how spoiled can you get - just the tail? None of the effort? He's not from New England)  a side of grilled shrimp (anyone else counting the cholesterol points  or am I just copping a sea-bean-eatin'  healthier-than-thou attitude? But wait)  and a side of ... lobster mac and cheese. He was in bliss. Ah  to have a twenty-years-younger heart!  Other reviewers had mentioned how dark it is in the interior seating area  and that's no joke. It takes a long time to get adjusted. Luckily the bill comes on a lighted notepad (no  really) so even if you can't really see what you're eating  you can at least see what you're paying."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Took my sister here for her birthday dinner because she's always wanted to go. We had a great view of the water show. The food was nothing special really. The reason for two stars is because the service we received was terrible. The server constantly forgot our orders it took forever to even get our drinks in. I mean for what we were paying I would have expected better service at least.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Would be five stars  but for the hefty $ bill.  My SO and I both had the $50 prix-fixe dinner menu.  It was very delicious but one should expect nothing less from a $150 dinner (including beverage  tax  and tip).
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"Wonderful restaurant!  YOU must call and reserve a spot on the patio with the Lake Bellagio and water show right in front of you.  Really  really nice!  Inside beautiful contemporary decor.  Lunch was delish!  Roasted chicken was succulent  salads perfect  soup extraordinarily impressive. Decently priced  modified Italian.  Every item I saw come out of the kitchen looked very good!  BTW what is the deal with ""flatbreads?""  When did pizza become a flatbread  what a contrived bunch of nonsense!  The ""flatbread"" did look good tho ;)"
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,"We had reservations for a Friday night for a party of 5 at 10pm.  We showed up extra early to request a table on the patio and said we did not mind a long wait to get a table on the patio.  We were told that we could  not get one and were seated inside close to our reservation time.  As we walked by the patio I saw several open tables and was wondering about them but did not say anything other than asking the  person who sat us to let us know if anything opened on the patio as we  would really like to be out there..  Since it was my mother-in-laws bday weekend I decided to go ask the hostess again if when we got to dessert we could possible be seated outside and walked in on the hostess offer a party of 6  a table outside!  What?  This was  very disappointing and made no sense since we had said we would wait as long as needed for a table outside.  I gave her a look and just said ""can you please try to move us outside for dessert"" and she said yes.. she definitely knew she had been caught giving a party basically the same size as ours a table outside.  I know they say they do not guarantee tables outside but it seems that even if you want a table outside they will try their best to sit you inside.  Focaccia bread and white chocolate bread (similar to a Brioche) with a green olive tapenade and black olive tapenade - 4 stars.  This bread was very good!  Fig and Prosciutto flat bread - 5 stars! this dish was delicious!  Layers of prosciutto  creamy Gorgonzola  sweet figs  balsamic marinated onions and some sort of chive!  Yummy!  Ricotta Ravioli without Sausage - 3 stars The ravioli were extremely tender with a creamy light ricotta filling.  I think this dish need the sausage though!  This will teach me not to mess with a chefs flavor combinations!  This dish would probably be 4-5 stars with the sausage.  Tiffany cocktail - 3 stars. Very sweet. Strong flavor of raspberry!  Warm bread pudding with white chocolate  caramelized pears  cranberry and Caramel ice cream. - 3 stars.  This was not a true bread pudding.  I am always disappointed when I order bread pudding and get something that really does not resemble it.  I would not order this again.  I would give it 3.5 stars for the awesome flat bread and wonderful view of the fountains."
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,8pm reservations...its 8:21. Have we been sat yet ? Nope. What is the point of making a reservation if you dont get sat on time and wait. And we are staying in the hotel in the suite tower...come on....
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Only gave it 4 stars because nothing was particularly AMAZING  but  everything  including the service  was GREAT. Food was flavorful  portions were large  my glass was never empty  didn't feel rushed but didn't have to wait too long for our food either. Would definitely eat here again.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I think I had high expectations on this restaurant because my friend told me how good it was to dine here. My friend from California came visit  and I made reservations at olives. Ordered the beet salad because I'm obsessed with beets. Omg!!! The beets were so sweet and yummy. My friend ordered scallops and I ordered the porkchop. Both were okay!!! Nothing special. For dessert  we got the souffle  which was okay as well. I know that souffles are made of egg whites and other stuff  but this souffle came out smelling like scrambled eggs. Presentation was lacking too. I'm not sure if I want to take my future visitors here.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,Excellent spot for lunch (maybe dinner too  but we lunched there this time). Good location in Bellagio arcade with patio dinning with a view of the Bellagio fountains display  but get there early or better book those tables early because they fill up fast.  For an appetizer we shared flatbread with prosciutto and fig- generous  portion and fabulous flavors.  Great wine choices and a variety of excellent main courses.   Service was superb without being overbearing.  Pricey  but a good value for the money.
Bars;American (New);Restaurants;Nightlife;Mediterranean,I had Sole Milanese and Mushroom Tart for lunch as part of the Restaurant Week special.  The food was absolutely delicious  and the portions were generous.  I sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender.  The staff is very friendly  something that I experience at most Bellagio restaurants.  The vibe here is a bit more relaxing than other places in Bellagio - less fancy  less trendy  more cozy.  I will come back again next time I'm in town.
Books;Mags;Music & Video;Bookstores;Hobby Shops;Shopping,Kind of a varied assortment of items.  Some cool  some just tacky and seemed a little out of place.  I didn't talk to the staff much  but overheard conversations between them and other customers.  They seemed knowledgeable and overall very friendly.  Allowed customers to take pictures of various things in the store  including the necklace the girl working was wearing.  I didn't find anything worth purchasing  but I'm glad I popped in.
Books;Mags;Music & Video;Bookstores;Hobby Shops;Shopping,I am on the NORTHSIDE of Las Vegas  however this GEM of a store is so worth the travel. They have so many things to choose from  a gift for someone special to supplies books  candles etc..... The thing that makes this store so unique are the truly wonderful owners and sales people.You feel like you are always among friends. Go see for yourself !
Books;Mags;Music & Video;Bookstores;Hobby Shops;Shopping,"The lady was nice and the prices were ok.  I liked that she talked to us openly without the usual unholier than thou attitude we get at psychic eye.   However..I got a grab bag for five bucks said to contain  among other possible ""treasures"" a magic wand  crystal ball  fairy dust and trinket. What I got for five dollars was a popsicle stick  a marble   some glitter and a wood pog with a star sticker on it.   Oh yes. I'm serious.   I thought grab bag...well   I would get some random delightful item worth five bucks...or a clearance item...not a bunch of crap...it wasn't even good enough to be crap.   I laid out the stuff and took pictures to make a joke blog about my magical grab bag. It was so pathetic I was loathe to admit I had wasted five dollars that could have gotten me a combo meal and abandoned the idea.   Harry Potter doesn't kill dementors with a popsicle stick!  Miss CLEO doesn't read fortunes from a marble! I can't join any self respecting coven with these as my tools!"
Books;Mags;Music & Video;Bookstores;Hobby Shops;Shopping,I was wonderfully surprised at this awesome little shop. This shop carried unique items and wicked awesome prices.
Books;Mags;Music & Video;Bookstores;Hobby Shops;Shopping,I stepped in out of curiosity after going to the home brew store next door- It's not my cup of tea...a smallish shop featuring items for your rituals/magic. Perhaps your seance or divining. I don't do religion period so being in here was almost as weird as being in church  but I suppose if you need sage or incense  you may need to stop in here at least once. All in all I'd say psychic eye has more of these sorts of things with a bigger shop and more house adornments for your chamber or altar.
Financial Services;Auto Insurance;Insurance;Home & Rental Insurance,This is definitely the best place to get your insurance  very nice and friendly workers .

Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Coming from Sacramento The shows I have been to were either in Arco Arena where the acoustics are Terrible and the others at the memorial auditorium which has better acoustics but is a nightmare to get out of when a show ends  this place was a breath of fresh air for the most part.   I had GA floor tickets and ended up about 2 to 3 feet from the stage for the show and was very very impressed with the acoustics in this place and the venue in general has the small feel and helps to make the show that much better. I have never been to a venue that allows cameras and video cameras to be used during the show and that is the one star deficit you see here. Not because I am trying to be like Lars from Metallic and crap all over everyones choice to share the music but I tend to get aggravated when a 300lb sweaty dude next to me has his stink pit right in my face while trying to record the ""ENTIRE SHOW"".   Other than the distraction of cameras in your face and Miss teenage dreamer screaming in your ear with hopes of getting on the tour bus this place is awesome. I would not hesitate to see a show here."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Yay  I'm a fan! No complaints about the venue here at all. There didn't seem to be a bad seat in the house and the alcohol wasn't as insanely expensive as I'd have thought ($5 for a beer  albeit a small one).  It was really easy to get in and out of the venue  and that's a huge plus in my book. I hate waiting for an hour just to walk out the door.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Halloween night I went to the joint for the Swedish House Mafia show and was pleasantly surprised with guest DJ's dropping in on the action.  First Kaskade then Tiesto and finally Dirty South.  What a show with the only billed DJ's being Swedish House Mafia.  Gotta love Vegas that's all I can say.    I got VIP tickets which meant Open Bar and Balcony seating.  This was great as drinks are pricey and I got a great view of the show.  After some drinks I had to go dance though so I went downstairs and was told I can only be in VIP area and I said I'd take my bracelet off they wouldn't let me.  So I hopped the rope and went to go dance.  The sound was great and I couldn't have asked for a better time on Halloween.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,***************************** 1427 ***************************     We worked with NACS conference and The Party At NACS 2015 was held here (http://www.thepartyatnacs.com/). The main floor looks a little bit runs down but the suites are well kept. The venue is bigger than it seems. With 7 suites upstairs on the second and third floor. Private rooms  bars  and bathrooms are convenient for artists and the entourage to be together. It was about 2 000 of us  and we had plenty of space  comfortable with about 300 people on the dance floor. Easy access in and out of the venue  good security  well organized event.     Chef Todd English was the guest chef to cook us a 10 courses nice sit-down dinner. Artists performed this year was Darius Rucker  Brett Michaels  Yellow Brick Road  and Flo Rida.      The Party at NACS has partnered with the Rex Griswold Foundation and Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health to Fuel the Fight against Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) - a fatal degenerative neurological disorder currently affecting a few of our own. There is no treatment.      This year  the biggest musical event of the NACS Show week is raising awareness about MSA and funds to accelerate research toward a cure - in support of the strength of those currently fighting  like Tom Gillard (Tropicana  QTG  MetRX) and Rex Griswold (Nestle Waters Vice President Strategy C-Store & Food Service) and  in memory of those like Rock 'N' Roll Chef Kerry Simon whose strength and spirit will always inspire us to do more to fight this horrible disease.    The service was great. Especially on the second floor with a private bartender in our suite  Precious Pat  he was amazing took care of our group and control the bar and Meet & Greet with Flo Rida. Our company and partner Celsius Drinks and D3M Licensing Group  we did an amazing job. When Flo Rida performed  the crowd when nut.      The sound systems were very good and so the lightings. Good time had by all.      You can see the party pictures here: http://nacsvipparty.phanfare.com/
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I came here for a Muay Thai fight. I couldn't find anywhere online where I could view a seating chart for a boxing ring set up which made buying tickets difficult. I ended up with a view of the corner of the ring slightly obstructed by the camera boom. A friend whose view was terribly obstructed complained and was re-seated easily. Getting in and out of the venue was easy. The seats were super close to each other. They can work on labeling row and seats better. Despite my apparent bitching I liked the venue enough for a fight. Unfortunately  the person I came to see didn't win. Boo!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I just saw the new Motley Crue show here.  AWESOME! the layout here is great and you should go with general admission if you can because the seats on the main floor are kind of far back.  Plenty of bar service so the lines are short.  I want to go back!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I really didn't love this venue.  Saw Hall & Oates here (don't judge me! lol) and I was expecting to have as good of a time as the last time I saw them at the Borgata in Atlantic City.  But this venue made it less enjoyable.    We initially got on a line we thought was to enter the venue.  Turns out it was just to get tickets and you had to go a very roundabout way to enter at the same spot if you already had your tickets.  We weren't the only people to make this mistake.    Seating assignments weren't very easy to decipher.  Little stickers on the floor label the rows.    Also  it's just a tight space.  A heavy set woman sitting next to me was pinching my thigh the whole time we were sitting.  Not her fault that the seating situation isn't spacious enough  but it was really uncomfortable.  When people would come through the aisles to get to their seat  you'd have no choice but to just move your knees to the side to let them through because standing up just made it even more difficult for them to pass by.    My drink was WEAK and expensive!  But I guess this is no different from any other concert venue.    On the bright side  it's not a very big venue so it kind of harks back to a time where concerts were in small  intimate spaces.  Any seat here would be a pretty good location in relation to the stage  it seems.    Wouldn't come here again except to see a concert that I really cannot miss.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The new Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel is still a average venue. In this latest expansion it appears they only made the Joint wider and added more BS VIP seating in the balcony but have yet to still address the poor acoustics by leaving the rafters open and having bare walls that resemble guitar fret boards. One of the supervisor of the ushers had bad attitude and reminded me of this b1Txh I worked with chiding people who wanted to go and view the souvenir stand by sending people around the long way out the corridor and back into the casino. The douchbag factor went up with the addition of the Affliction store and tattoo place. It still takes over an hour to get out of the POS garage on Paradise on concert nights. Parking at Terrible's might be a better idea during a concert.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I miss the old Joint. So many memories and great times there. Plus  it was smaller  cooler  and just sounded better - to me anyways. But alas  the old Joint is gone and the new Joint is here.  But new Joint ain't so bad. It's significantly bigger  but the spirit of the old Joint is still there. The best thing about the old and new Joint is the tiered floor levels. It's all GA  but there are several levels of railings to perch on. And this means you can be in the back and still see the full stage unobstructed - which is a great thing if you aren't exactly tall.  And the sound is still incredible. And the bar area is larger at the new Joint - so less time waiting for a beer. Plus  there are flatscreens showing the show above the bars  so you never have to miss anything.  All in all  it's still a great venue to catch a live show.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,From 8/30/16 Not only was this my first time to the Joint  but I was also seeing Deftones for the first time as well. The Joint is located in the Hard Rock. This is a huge concert venue  compared to their other one Vinyl. We had Balcony seats which are by far the best perspective to see a show. The bar was reasonably priced  bathrooms easily accessible  I was pleased with my visit here.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I always enjoy going to the Hard Rock for dinner drinks or my favorite local activity..People Watching! Last night was my first venture into The Joint. -Parking was a pleasure ever since they added the new garage off of Harmon -The line that was formed from the box office area all the way past the tattoo shop in the hallway. This would not be a big deal but the line moved so slowly. Is it always this bad for a concert? I was in line 30-45 mins before the start time and i made it in just in time for the opening song. I felt bad for the others who were still waiting. The was the biggest turn off of my experience!!! -The concert area was larger than i expected. A large floor for general admission and balcony seating on the sides and in the back. Sound was great and there are two monitors for even better viewing. I would definately go back for another show here but i hope they would work on their pre concert screening so every makes it in on time.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,great venue  big enough to not be cramped and tight but small enough to be intimate and close to all the action on stage.   My friends and I got Motley Crue tickets and sat in the 5th row dead center. best seats I have eveer had at a concert in my entire life. looking forward to my next show at the joint
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,So  I went to The Joint last year to see the Black Eyed Peas perform. My friend Tabitha were lucky enough to get free tickets to the show because she knew someone who knew someone that was giving away tickets to the show. Anyway  we get their early  and after waiting with other ticketholders for an hour  the doors open and we go in and find a good standing spot close to the stage  their is no seating on the entire first floor.  Their is a bar and its way in the back towards the entrance  and good luck trying to get back their during the show. So we stood for another hour waiting for the show to start. The show starts and everybody who didn't get a spot in the front trys to force their way closer to the stage  making me personally feel claustrophobic. I only saw two hours of the show before my feet where killing me in my semi comfortable dress shoes. So  I left and sat on the couch outside until my friend was ready to go. Overall   I would never go to The Joint again because what I had to endure for that free ticket made the show not worth it.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This was the second weekend in a row that I've been to The Joint for a concert. The first artist I saw was Kenny Chesney and just last weekend was Dashboard Confessional.   This is a great sized venue with no bad seating or standing area. There is a bar in the back or if you don't want to lose your place then you can wait to see a waiter to order a drink. The stage is big for the artists to move around and the music sounds really good at this venue.  The set up of the venue changes from one artist to the next. For the Kenny Chesney concert it was all standing only unless you were in the balcony but for the Dashboard concert it was seating in the front and standing in the back. It's just something you'd need to check as you are purchasing tickets.   Be aware that what they deem as a professional camera is not allowed. Also  if you buy a drink from the bar and go out of the venue they will  not let you back in with the drink. I was let down by this as you might want to buy a t-shirt during the concert because the lines might be shorter and you have to go outside to do so.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"This was my first concert here  was pretty good...we saw Prince.  The concert was pretty short  which was disappointing  I thought it would be longer than an hour and 15?  Only mentioning it in this review  because I'd think that the venue would have a longer show...we were at the 8pm first show  the second was at 11pm. Anyways  the concert was good  not a bad seat in the house  great small venue.  However  it was weird.  We had tickets for the front stage area  standing room only.  Which I got on Ticketmaster  and were the ""best available seats""  also most expensive available at the time.  And were good.  But  weirdly  when we scanned and went in  not one staff member ever checked where our tickets were  we just walked on down to the front.  Making me think it was so crowded down front (we had to stand way to the side) because everyone just went where ever they wanted  no one was checking tickets.    Also  of course the drinks were a complete rip-off.  We got in line and I got 2 Blueberry Vodkas w/ Soda ($22)  boyfriend got 2 Bud Lights ($24).  WTF  how is beer more expensive than Vodka?  Weird.  I asked the bartender but she just said ""they're large beers""  Not like we're at the Hofbrau Haus in Munich and they're as large as your head...they were probably 20 ounces.  Whatever.  I didn't go to Vegas thinking I'd come home with a lot of cash."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue  bigger than the HoB  with better drink prices.  The only drawback is having to fight the casino crowd getting to and from the show.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This was a great venue for my first concert at the Joint. We saw Prince on Friday night and would see him from the floor and from the suite. What a show!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came here for 2 nights of  Widespread Panic & it was pretty flippen sweet. Security was cool..no problems. They even let us bring in booze from our room. Dont think that is allowed tho. We were able to roam about where ever we wanted. And we found a great spot right by the stage. It was also nice that the security turned a blind eye to all the party favors going around since it was alot like a dead show. Gotta love jam bands!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I love the bar area. Great acoustics make this a venue worth visiting!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The wait for drinks at the back is terrible.  Get your drinks just outside the arena in the store in the hallway  and bring it in in a plastic cup.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I was here for Tiesto in concert March 5 and it was off the hook! This venue is awesome but the only draw back for GA floor tickets is there is no place to sit! I notice this with almost all the clubs I been to in Vegas. If you don't get bottle service  expect to stand all night long. Other then that  I had a very very very great night =)
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,i have seen a pet shop boys concert and it was my first time to see them live here.   IT WAS AWESOMEEEE!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The Joint is a perfectly fine and generic music venue. The acoustics are dandy  the beer prices are steep  and you will have to wait in a line of cars to get out of the garage afterward. (Pro Tip: Park at the Silver Sevens - formerly Terrible's - walk the half block and save yourself the headache.) However  if you want to see certain bands  you do not get to pick the venue (unless you are Scrooge McDuck)  so we are stuck with places like The Joint  The Pearl  or House of Blues - which is not all that bad. They are corporately ran  so you get perks like cleanliness (relative to concert venues)  security  and a decent layout. They may not be exactly ideal  but these venues are decent enough - and most people I know are not coming for the theater  they are coming for the act.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I'm very torn on this venue.  On one hand  they bring in some of my favorite bands (I saw Death Cab For Cutie and The Raconteurs two days apart recently) and it always sounds top notch.  On the other hand  I can never seem to find a spot where I can see the band (I'm 5'8"")  and both of the bars are always pretty packed  so it can be awhile to get a drink.  I have had some luck with the upstairs balcony... they have assigned seating so you can sit for the duration of the show rather than stand  and the bar upstairs is less crowded.  Unfortunately  the balcony is not always open  and when it is  the tickets are usually higher priced.  But like I said  I've seen some great bands here  and I love the Hard Rock  so it's 4 stars for this music venue."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The Joint is a huge venue. In my youth  I would have loved to be in the general admission and fight my way to the front  but now I am more of stand on the balcony type of person. At least that was how I was during Kenny Chesney. Being in the VIP area up top was definitely the way to go. The bar upstairs never has a line and the cocktail waitresses come around frequently. If you are sober at a country concert then you are not doing it right.   I was shocked that the venue was doing a drink special. Malibu had a spiced rum specially for the No Shoes Nation tour. It tastes like Captain. Any drink or shot with it was only $5. For two bud lights and three rum and diets  it ran us $31. That is unheard of on the strip.   The view from the VIP area is awesome! There is room to dance and drink without others bumping into you. We were on the far left side and had the perfect view of Kenny. Of course he sang all of his hits and played for two hours straight. I just wished that Zac Brown Band was opening up for him like they do on other stops. I can't complain too much though. Great night!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I've been here several times and this is my favorite venue in town for concerts.  I'm writing specifically about getting VIP tickets to shows.  Last month was the first time I requested VIP tickets via email and the process was smooth and the tickets were great!  I'm too damn old to be standing for a 6+ hour concert and the balcony provided a great view of everything.  People are whining about the price of drinks  but the price is pretty on par to the rest of the strip.  You should know if you are going to go to a concert  you'll pay a premium for drinks.  Be wise and pregame like the rest of us old folks!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,pretty cool spot. multiple levels  and bars all over the place.  yay!  went to a private concert here - had a great time. the food sucked  but that was the people hosting the party  not the venue.  for concerts there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house.  just big enough  but still has a bit of that small club feel.  liked it
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I love the newly remodeled Joint! Especially since I'm short  General Admission is not a fun option for me  however  the floor is tiered (so that even if you are in the back  you will still be about 2 feet higher than the people in front of you). We saw Linkin Park here and surprisingly  except for the pit area  the rest of the crowd was pretty respectful and not pushing even though it's still general admission floor. I can't complain about anything - great acoustics and really nice place to see a band!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I love The Joint! We saw GNR here in Nov '12  and not only was the show AH-MAY-ZING  the venue really kicked ass too. We bought some of the least expensive tickets and had an awesome view. It was clean  the staff was friendly  all around a great experience. I can't wait to catch another show here soon.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue!  I attended the Them Crooked Vultures concert this weekend at The Joint  and was thoroughly impressed at how organized and accommodating it was for what felt like thousands of people. (Guess that's Vegas for ya!) The sound and lighting was obviously a well thought out part of the design. Much props to the AV team there as well.  Can't smoke in the venue  but their system of scanning people in and out made it real simple to take a break and come back to rock.  Drinks were affordable and access to them was simple enough  and the efficient and friendly bartenders made it work  and kept the lines reasonable.  I had a wonderful time with my group of about 15 other rock enthusiasts  and I'd love to attend another event here.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This place was great. Saw motley crue here and by far it is the best I've ever seen them. The place was clean and we had a great view from the 300 section tables. There were plenty of bars so it was not crowded. The restrooms were super clean and the waitresses were friendly.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw British Pink Floyd.  Awesome performance. Less than awesome venue. The venue had the most uncomfortable folding chairs placed together with small isles. The sound was good but not nearly as encompassing as a The Palm.  Would have been full 5 stars but the venue detracted from the evening  The British Pink  Floyd is awesome and I look forward to seeing them again. My hope is that it is somewhere else.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I came to the new Joint for the first time for Friday night boxing last week.  The original Joint was where I went to my first bout.  It was interesting to see how it had changed.  The seats I purchased for the fight were towards the back just in front of the standing room section.  Though my dad and I were in the back  we could still clearly see the ring and the boxers within.  The lights above were rather bright but that is what you get when you go to a televised bout.  I saw a few celebrities down ring side who were taking pictures with fans and signing autographs.  Most noteably was Oscar de la Hoya.  That was exciting to see.  While I had a great time at the fight  it was not due to The Joint and how it is set up.  In fact  that is what I did not like about it.  There are terraced sections that head upwards as you move towards the back.  This may provide a better view of the stage but it also contains people in small areas with no place to go but sideways to get out.  These terraced sections are enclosed by a fence and railing.  If everybody had to escape in a hurry say due to an unfortunate fire  there would be some even more unfortunate incidents in trying to escape.  I hope that never happens.  On the lighter side of complaints  the seats set up for the boxing are not at all comfortable.  They are slightly padded but not enough for the several hours spent in them for a boxing match.  The backs are also inclined too far.  It put a lot of pressure on my lower back.  For comfort and possible safety concerns  I have to dock The Joint a bit.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,went to the joint this past weekend to see headliner Tracy Morgan perform stand-up comedy. He is hilarious and our second time watching him live.  The joint is located inside the Hard rock casino. I would not consider staying at this casino since it's a bit far from the strip but i would return to the joint.  Here is why:  the space has an open feel  adequate seating  cold air conditioning which is important when it's 106 outside  excellent lighting and non smoking venue. (which i love).  The ushers helped us find out seats quickly and our seat location turned out to be excellent. we had a wonderful evening.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The new Joint is great. Because of the layout and new sound it tops the Pearl for best mid sized venue.  The old Joint I loved the layout but the sound was awful!  The new Joint the sound is great  same great layout only larger. They even have reserved seats for the people that dont truly like the concert experience. To me a venue should be 90% or more  general admission otherwise its a total corporate experience and not built for true music and concert fans.  Great sounds  good promotion with Live Nation. Happy they got rid of Andrew Hewitt  he robs fans on ticket prices and the bands don't get any more money.  I only wish the Hard Rock would get a better parking garage for when concerts get out. That or  a larger valet area.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This place is amazing for shows! A huge stage and awesome seating. There are two floors that you can go to and watch from above so the view is amazing all the way around!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Tiestooooo's Club Life!  I came here last weekend to see Tiesto like many of the other Yelpers here.  I was blown away by the entire show and I couldn't have asked for a better night.  I was with a great group of friends and the music made us all feel the love that night.  I had no problems with will call and waited in a 2 minute line to get my ticket.  It was actually a really relaxing concert entrance compared to other concerts that I have been to at places like Staples or the Honda Center.  The Joint was spacious: large without being ginormous.  When we walked in around midnight the intro dj was still spinning.  While waiting for Tiesto  I was able to get a good feel for the place.  The stage is larger than you would think could fit into the Hard Rock's tiny casino.  The two floors above the main floor were way up!  I was on the main floor and I almost forgot that the second and third were above us.  No claustrophobia here.  All of the lights  streamers  confetti  and tiny birds that fell from the ceiling made the show even better.    The only downside of the night is that water cost $15 a bottle.  It is pretty hard to not get thirsty at a 4 hour show  where you are jumping and fist pumping the whole time.  But what can you say... water is ridiculous at all clubs in Vegas  The Joint was a great venue to host Tiesto's Las Vegas residency.  If I could I would come again in a heartbeat.  Surrender to the sound...  *Highlight of the night: Escape me
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"First visit (post rebrand): WEC 42.   It was moved from one part of the Hard Rock to another and resized from a club venue to a monstrosity that affords you only a fraction of the awesome lines-of-sight that the previous The Joint afforded before its relocation/renaming to The Joint Rogue. Anyone who walks into this venue after having been in the other one really gets a shock when they see the new size of this thing and a bigger shock if they get a terrible line-of-sight to the stage/cage.  I have attended too many shows and Mixed Martial Arts events here to list  both before when it was club-sized and probably a four-to-five star venue to now where it has no idea what it is (is it a mid-size venue with arena-level shittiness?) or have enough competent staff to be able to fulfill their duties.   One specially asinine experience with their incompetent staff:  my girlfriend was dizzy from the BTU-heat being generated by the crowd on the floor during an Interpol/White Rabbit/Imagine Dragons concert. So we walk out of the pit and get to the back wall off to the side (bothering no one  except one overly inconsiderate staff member) and she sits on the ground so she does not keel over while I run over to the bar to get preposterously priced bottles of water. ""Get up!"" she is yelled instead of affording her a minute to bring down her body temp or asking if she is feeling alright. I get there right after she is threatened with being kicked out in her condition. Awesome. Hard Rock staff in a nutshell.   Another asinine experience since I have so many:  different show  same award-winning staff. We queue for an Arcade Fire/Local Natives Coachella runoff show. Once we are inside on barrier centre there is this fat  clearly Mallcop-Paul-Blart-inspired staff member (with a shirt one size too small for his portly mid section). He is so intent on being a Employee of the Month that he is watching everyone creepily like a hawk to make sure he can throw someone out. Of course he throws someone out  and since his friend protests -- although he was doing nothing besides protesting  which he has a right to do since the fucking show had not even started yet  this goon security gets in his most gut-sucked  chest-out posterior and squares up from across the barrier with this guy from LA and keeps repeatedly asking in an agitated manner if he wants to join his friend. Great conflict resolution. Something tells me that this clown would not be so brave if he was not inside The Joint with all the other black shirts backing him like a gang of unfit J.R.O.T.C. rejects.   The afterparty room upstairs is overly tiny and sucks as much as The Joint's staff but at least Blart is not there. - E"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Downgrading to 3 stars after going to Santana tonight. So  I guess for show that have a large +40 crowd they need to put the chairs on the floor so there brittle knees can sit. However the the 100 section before you are on the floor that is usually standing with rails should NOT HAVE CHAIRS! FUCK! You take an open section that is about 9 feet long and add 3 rows of seats that literally leaves  2 feet of width between seats. Meaning you are jumping over crashing through people to get to your seat and then every time the 50 year old women in the middle need to double fist drinks for refils you have to have to get up. Which they did 4 times during the 3 hour concert.  The old people crowd as the show went on decided to dance but it really looked more like epileptic seizures all around.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Nice bartenders  friendly security (yay to both The Joint and Hard Rock in general)  decent set up. It's mostly general admission setting with a wide floor and some upper level seating. The sound and lighting seem really good.   I was on the floor in the front next to the stage and speakers... Loud  obviously...  great light.s.. it's a little harder on the floor and I'm getting too old to deal with the crowd  but it was fun.   ++ for the strong drinks the bartender served!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Worst ever. I work production  Own a Successful production company here in town  and this is just a sad case of people not doing there job. Buy tickets to the Brooklyn Bowl or HOB. The joint is BS.    This was the first and last time I come here. Got tickets for row CC seats 1 & 2 and row DD seats 3 & 4. They didn't add enough chairs for row DD. Gave my seats away in row CC and didn't have the seats for row DD. An hour later they corrected there mistake after having to talk to several security guards (with attitudes) and managers (who were dumbfounded) was pretty simple to me. Seats 3 & 4. I could count down the row and figure it out. But it was my fault you set the wrong seating chart then wouldn't move the people in the wrong seats because they didn't want to move. Like I said. Never come here again. Will be protesting you for a while after this unprofessionalism.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,What better birthday present to self than a concert?  I saw Tiesto at The Joint on Feb. 5th & it was wonderful!  My only complaint  it was really hot & difficult to breathe in the general admission//front. I know this is Vegas  but I still wished it was not a smoking-friendly joint. I probably got enough 2nd hand smoke throughout this 6 hour long concert to last me a lifetime.   Also  the bar charged 15$ for water bottles...really  guys? I could understand 5$...you know there are  people drinking or taking pills and there is a risk of dehydration & you fully take advantage!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is by far one of my favorite venues to see a show! I'm kind of over the huge arenas where everything is far and unless you pay a ridiculous amount of money you are so far away that you have to watch the show on the big jumbo screens anyway. Not at The Joint! You get a great view from wherever you are and since the bar is located inside you won't have to miss one single moment while getting your drink on.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,My 1st concert at The Joint and I got to get real cozy with the place as we were all waiting on beloved yet notoriously late rock and roll star Axl Rose to take the stage.  Show was supposed to be 10PM but it was almost 2 hours later that Axl made his appearance with Guns N Roses--and they played until after 3AM.    The venue looks just about like the Moody Theater/ACL Live in Austin though if you've never been there this would be completely irrelevant.  What I'm saying is that the venue is intimate enough to make you feel like you are up close yet big enough to hold thousands of people (thank you 2009 renovations).  There is the stage  and a concert pit area coming out from there and then 2 other levels above that.  Lots of famous musicians have played here including Aerosmith  Motley Crue and last year's residency of Tiesto.  This year Guns N Roses picked The Joint to do their 2ish week run of shows.    The sound system is great speaking from a perspective of being in front of the stage on the floor though I have no idea what the effects are from the other levels as I have heard mixed things.  Drinks will cost you your first born child but you can save up as a concert of your life might be worth it.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I bought tickets for my hubby as a birthday gift as his favorite band was performing at the Joint.  We saw Carnival of Madness featuring Shinedown with special guests Papa Roach  Skillet  In This Moment and We As Human  playing on Sunday  September 15th  2013  We love love love love Shinedown which is one of our personal favorite bands ever.  This was a 6 hour concert so I purchased balcony tickets  front row of the top tier which was actually very good seating.   We really enjoyed the concert and being together as this was our first visit to The Joint for an event.  My only issue is that I wish the box office Management and staff had more integrity and were more up front with seating and ticket purchases. I explained to the box office agent in person that I wanted to get very good specific seating for this special occasion. She claims that the front section of the balcony was sold out as we were going over the seating chart together which is what I had wanted.   So I picked out the best seats left on the balcony  front row of the 2nd tier and was told that I had 72 hours to obtain a refund or exchange for different seats.  I went in person to the box office to purchase tickets so I could specifically discuss seating as I wanted something special for my baby's birthday.   She then tells me in order to purchase VIP seating I would have to email a certain person at jointvip@hrhvegas.com who only handles those request. I emailed the representative as informed to do and am sent back the following price list.   The seating I wanted was VIP Loft Level Tickets which I was informed was ' SOLD OUT"" by the box office agent. Which was not true  they were available however only through the VIP contact at a much higher price.   I just ended up keeping the tickets I bought and it worked out as the seats were decent.   The Joint don't impress me much so I hope the next time Shinedown comes to town they perform elsewhere.  *********************************************************************************************** A VIP Table on the 2nd Level costs $1 200 and includes: (Section 201 - Studio Level)  - 4 tickets - An open bar - An escort through the crowd and to your table - Custom VIP Credential for each guest You can purchase two tickets to a VIP table for half of the price  with the understanding that you may be sitting with another couple.  A VIP Suite on the 2nd Level costs $5 000 and includes: (Suite 1  2 or 3 - Studio Level) - 12 tickets - An open bar - An escort through the crowd and to your suite - Custom VIP Credential for each guest - Suite Food Packages available for an additional charge    A VIP Loft Level Ticket costs $100 and includes:  (Balcony seating in Section 302  303  or 304 - Row A) - 1 Seated Ticket in the front row of the Loft Level / 3rd Level   - Custom VIP Credential for each guest - An escort through the crowd and to your seat"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The jerkoff bouncer made me check my SMALL NORMAL SIZED purse at the front desk before entering the venue.. I told him he could look in it  whatever  but he claimed it was house policy to not let purses in? HUH? I won't waste my time with this place unless a really good band is playing.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,We saw Rascal Flatts last night here.  Our seats were very comfortable and the sound was great.  We sat in the upper section and couldn't have been happier.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,You know The Joint is Ok - when there's concerts I wanna see. But it does suck. VIP Seating is upstairs.  The last time I was there was for Bam Margera's bachelor's party. It was ok. There were a lot of kids. I gave someone my all you can drink wristband. Because I had an extra. She was grateful. You know what makes this place bad is how they herd people in and out. It's not the most efficient method. Drinks are ok - there usually are 2 but they wheel in a portabar if needed. I think we need more seating in here. Better accoustics  and definitely better methods of entry.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw the Deftones here and thought the sound and lay out of the place was great for a concert. I like the tiered floor space so that you can have a better view. Great sounds and I think the beer guy walking around selling beers is a nice feature. I am sure I will be back!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The venue is nice and intimate  not a bad seat in the house. The staff however I could do without.  I had purchased tickets for the Def Leppard Hysteria concert on ticketmaster.com  when we arrived at the venue they scanned our tickets at the door and told us they were coming up as already being used. If I'd have purchased the tickets off of Craigslist I'd have been concerned that someone had scammed me  but seeing how I bought the tickets direct I knew it was  problem with their system. The girl at the door admitted they'd been having this problem all night and asked us to move to the side while she tried to get a manager. She asked someone to get a manager for us and she kept the traffic moving while we waited... and waited... and waited!  We waited nearly a half hour before a manager came and said a word to us  even though we watched 2 separate staff members flag her down numerous times  she was apparently too busy to help us. When she finally did come over she took my tickets and asked my my ID then went into an office full of people and we waited some more. Finally she returned with our tickets and said  ""Okay you're good to go."" But there was no apology for their apparent problem with their scanners  no apology for our wait  and no offer to make our experience better - more of just a  ""well OK  get on your way"".  I had purchased general admission tickets which were standing room only. I was concerned after our long wait that we'd be at the back of a huge crowd  but turns out there were only maybe 80-100 people in general admission all together so we actually had a great view and people weren't packed in too tight. Next time I think I'll purchase the table seating on the balcony  but I'd say our GA tickets were as good as the seated floor seats and we actually had even more room to move around than they did. It's not like people sit during most concerts anyway right?  The drinks were a bit ridiculously priced - $14 for a Bud Light. But they did let you bring in drinks from the casino as long as you put it in a plastic cup so we just got free drinks from playing slots and brought them in that way.  I am sure we'll come to another concert at this venue. Doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house and you're up close and personal with the performers. Just don't expect to be treated like you're anything special from the staff."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great acoustics here.  Went to see Motley Crue and were definitely pleased with the show.  Would definitely go back to a show here again.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Revisited The Joint Friday night for another show and it  again  disappointed us. We got a single drink this time to try it out  a different one  too to see if it were better and it wasn't. And then we went to sit on the side of the walkway and some mop pusher came and told us to move. OK whatever  the ledges looked like seating area so bad design on Hard Rock's part. But then later in the show we were at the very last stadium standing part and this girl with a cast on her leg was sitting down on a small edge of the back wall and they MADE her get up! It was just so ridiculous. She wasn't in the way at ALL and she was clearly sitting for medical reasons. That and other reasons we'll never come back to this venue no matter who is playing.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Soundgarden last night.  They crushed for 2 hours 15 minutes solid.  But the Joint; well that's another story.  First  the the positives.  Great view from any point in the venue  and nice restrooms.   Now the negatives: My wife and I bought VIP tickets in order to have a seat.  200 dollars each; again; great view.  Wanted a couple of draft beers; were instructed that they only have draft beer on the first floor.  Proceeded to first floor and were told that we were not allowed at that bar.  WTF?  If we had GA tix we could go  but not VIP.  HUH?  We have wristbands and tickets  what is the problem.  Well  the little security man was just a cattle prod with a penis and could not be bothered with logic; so we went back upstairs.  A very nice bartender upstairs offered to get us some beers after he saw our frustration.  He was then promptly written up by his TOOL of a manager for going downstairs.  To add insult to injury  the only draft available was Bud and Bud light.  Earth to Hard Rock; calling the Hard Rock -- this is a friggin rock n roll venue;  where the hell is the draft beer?  They will gladly pour you a canned beer into a plastic cup  but no draft?  Seriously. Secondly; the sound was loud to the point of distortion.  Now  don't get me wrong  I like decibels until my ears bleed; but it shouldn't be a muddy mush of audio soup.  Get some effin clarity please.   All in all  wouldn't go back.  Probably a great venue for those who want to stand five hours in the GA section  but VIP at the Joint must stand for Viscious Internal Probing.  I think I need some Preparation H.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,You have to hand it to Vegas hotels- they definitely don't skimp on their music venues. What The Joint may lack in sweaty east coast charm it more than makes for with amazing acoustics (millions of dollars from gaming can be useful!)  awesome lighting  and fantastic decor. Although far from being intimate  the Joint has a less cavernous feel than The Pearl. Saw Phoenix here recently  and although  it may have been the thrill of seeing them play live  I totally enjoyed the Joint.  First of all $3 landsharks!! Not sure if this is the norm but I was expecting to pay way too much for some watered down concotion. Instead I found myself enjoying a delicious beer at happy hour prices.  Secondly  it was super easy to get to the front and the crowd was tame compared to most venues I've been to. Being able to breath was definitely not a problem here.  Most importantly the acoustics and lighting were top notch and they let us up on stage for the last song  which was beyond priceless. I just stood there snapping pictures and dancing around waiting for some sweaty bouncer to drag me off stage  and yet that sweaty bouncer never appeared. It was fantastic! Awesome show!!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I saw The Moody Blues this past Friday night and the acoustics were great. I sat in the Orchestra Reserved section where there was plenty of elbow room between seats and enough room for whenever people needed to pass by to go to the bar. The bar in back had several bartenders and was always at least 5 deep. I didn't have the patience to wait for a drink. Proving that The Moody Blues are just as good sober.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I first saw Atlantis Morrissette here back in the late 90's when The Joint was very cozy.  We saw Darius Rucker at the expanded joint recently and were not as pleased with the experience.  The place is okay but does not have the same feel as the previous Joint.  The staff were also very disorganized and not very friendly.  You have to enter by their convention area which is a pain.  It would be nice it you could exit that way as it is pretty close to the Paradise Garage.  Of course they make you exit through the casino though.  I would attend another concert here as the place isn't horrible.  Parking can be a bit rough  especially if there are multiple events going on.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I love this venue! My first time here was for the Shinedown concert. I was supposed to be upstairs in a seat but had a friend with me who had GA tickets. I love GA in this venue! It was perfect  I could stick myself up against a railing and have a blast dancing and singing alone. The bar lines moved quickly even though they were long.   I will definitely be back for future shows!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,My husband and I arrived at the Joint for a Santana concert two Saturdays ago only to find out the concert had been cancelled two months prior.  We received no notice that the concert had been cancelled.  Our tickets had been purchased in person and there was no request for information in case of cancellation.  Our money was refunded but considering we had planned our entire trip around this concert we were not too pleased.  We were offered discount meal coupons (too late we ate right before) and awful drink coupons for well drinks in the worst bar in the casino.  We never heard why the concert was cancelled  but we won't be paying to see Santana or heading back to the Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Prince was awesome. Nice little venue  not a bad seat in the house.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I saw Def Leppard on April 5  2013. What a great show. We were in row GG  on the right side of the stage. the view was acceptable. The seating goes way outside the sightline for the stage. We were in the last two seats on that row. ...7th row but how the seats were set up  we were actually 3rd row. The sound was great. It was easy to get in and out. Took a cab there and back to the Flamingo. Once we got to our seats  we never left them. it's not often that you can see a band like DL in such a small venue. The place only holds 4 000 people.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Tiesto on April 2  2011 was freaking awesome here! The line was really fast and I purchased the 3rd floor seats with the open bar. The whole layout of this place is awesome and you would never know that it was tucked away at the Hard Rock Casino. Anyways  the open bar was from 9pm-11pm and you just had to tip the bartenders a buck. Instead of fighting in line to get drinks  there were several stations set up to serve drinks.  The good thing about the third floor is you get to sit in seats. You can dance but when you get tired  you can sit  unlike the main floor where you have to stand for a while. Great view from the third floor and the bass was hard hitting  even though we were the farthest section away from the stage.   Go with a crew of friends and you should have a blast.  The show lasted from 10pm-4am! It was an epic night. This is a great venue for artists and if you want to see Tiesto live  Vegas is the way to go.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Def Leppard here on March 27  2013. The concert was excellent  definitely one of the best  of hundreds  I have seen  in addition to being one of the best Def Lep concerts I have been to. The venue is small enough that even standing in the back you can see the stage great. The sound and lighting were perfect. I would totally go see a concert here again.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I went to see Kenny Chesney and paid a premium for a balcony seat. To my surprise I had a partially obstructed view from what I can only assume was lighting equipment?! (It was a large black encased platform coming from the ceiling). Yes I was sitting 1 row from the top but the joint should have warned me about the obstructed view before buying the tkt.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I got free tickets to Bill Maher at the joint.  The place is just the right size for standup.  Fits a few hundred to maybe a thousand people comfortably.  I can only imagine what it would be like to see a really awesome band in such an semi-intimate setting.  Maybe that's why it costs $100+ per ticket for most big name acts.  It's not dive bar or concert hall intimate  but about as close as you'll get for a place in a Vegas mega-resort.  There's a bar area on the opposite end of the stage.  Can't recall how much my beer went for.  This was back in August.  The Joint is inside the Hard Rock  which is fairly easy to access  since it's off the strip.  And for some reason the Hard Rock is always crawling with some of the hottest women you'll see in Vegas  so that's a huge plus.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to the Tiesto event here in Feb... Not sure how other nights may be but this is my experience:  I had will call and it didn't take me a long time to get my tickets and get into the venue. I did go at 10:30 though so I'm not sure if it took longer later on. The 2 opening DJs were pretty good and did a good job at getting the crowd ready for Tiesto! The bars were pretty easily accessible and it didn't take a long time to get drinks so that was good.  The venue is AWESOME. It's a BIG music hall with LOTS of tables... I feel like if they took out the whole first row of tables and made the dance floor bigger it would have been better because the dance floor def got pretty crowded around 12 and I had to move to the side to have any space to dance.   When Tiesto came on it was just CRAZY. The visuals  music  everything was just really AMAZING... There are a lot of surprises so I won't spoil it for you all. If you like trance/house music or if you like Tiesto  you have to go see him. I think he's the resident DJ there and will spin once a month... This is DEF A MUST!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,1 of the best venues in Vegas.  (House of Blues @ Mandalay Bay is pretty sweet too and comparable in capacity.)  Anywho  nothing like seeing 1 of your favorite bands and then hitting Pink Taco to finish off the night.  A night to remember: 311 with Pepper & The Wailers in '06:  http://www.flickr.com/photos/diana985/sets/72157600398958270/
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I saw linkin park here. I enjoyed it. I saw them at the sunset music festival and it was not that great. The venue is small so you feel the intimacy even if you are in the back at the bar. They have rails to separate people. PLus they have levels if you can not handle being around people. I will defintely see them again here.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Worst venue ever!    Waited in a short line by one entrance   about 15 feet from the merchandise table.  Security said we can't go straight to table   have to walk around.  So we walk 1/4 mile around to another line.  Wait.  Go in. As the lady was about to scan our tickets   I asked about the merch table.  She said go now and come back when done.  So we do that.  My kids get yelled at by security because we aren't allowed to come back in.  No line   we just need to go back around.  Again. So we exit (by the first security guard) and walk the 1/4 mile again. As we get close to the front   security stops us. We aren't allowed to bring in the merchandise that we just bought at the table.   Are you ducking kidding me??   I managed to shove the crap into my purse   and they reluctantly let us in. So we're back at the ticket scanner lady when some other lady cuts in front FROM THE MERCHANDISE TABLE and gets her ticket scanned before us.   My jaw fell to the floor.  If my daughters' lifetime of happiness was not so dependant on seeing Austin Mahone tonight   I would have seriously flipped my shift at this point.    Ticket scanner shrugged her shoulders and says   ""she's VIP.""   Ok. I get it.  I'm not important enough to be treated like a human being.  Well then   HRH   you can go duck yourself.  This will be my last experience with anything related to Hard Rock.  I'll spend my money at places that appreciate me and don't treat me and my kids like lab rats.   And you know what else?  It's Vegas   summer   110 degrees.  They waited until 20 minutes after the show started before turning on the a/c.    -- as I'm about to submit this   my kids just pointed out paramedics helping someone that passed out.  I wonder if the heat had something to do with that."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This venue is huge and the layout is pretty awesome.  Don and I came here for the first time the other day after winning some Cedric the Entertainer tickets. We were given free balcony seating tickets. The seats were pretty far back  but it gave us a pretty nice view of the entire venue. Plus  they had two large projected screens anyway. The show started on time with two openers whom were both pretty funny. The sound system was great. I could hear everyone loud and clear. However  there were a few things that annoyed me  like the group of extremely loud and obnoxious people behind us and the dirty lady sitting next to Don that was FILING HER NAILS and had so many belongings that she didn't even notice her big coat was taking up half of Don's lap. She also kept taking pictures WITH FLASH. Why would you take a picture with flash on when you're pretty damn far away from the stage? That just made no sense  but no one stopped her. In fact  there were a bunch of people taking pictures with flash in the audience. I mean  I understand they let people take pictures  but they should really prohibit the use of flash. It's just very distracting and annoying.   Other than that  I still had fun here and I'd love to see an actual concert here because the venue is very nice.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"4.7 Stars  Location Overview: Hard Rock Casino is definitely a place for the younger crowd. Casino-The Joint is nothing but filled with historical musicians and records. This place is perfectly decorated with Musicians pictures  clothes  records  musical instruments and great music playing all the time. The joint is a decent size for any type of concert. There is a big section near the stage for general admission. About 100-150-ft back it breaks off into General admission with higher stands. Up top towards the back there are about 100 seats looking straight at the stage. On the sides (which I have stood) have a great view of the stage and you are closer than those in seats and those in (a crowded area) in general admission. I have bought tickets for this area twice and have never had a problem with it. It is off to the side with no seats but standing is not a problem when you are jamming to the music and do not have to deal with over crowded people. That is the difference between this section and general admission. You can see the stage  the artist and not be over crowded.   Customer Service: The first time I came here it was to see Paramore and It took about an 3 hours for everyone to get through the door. Ushers were there to great just usual ""hey guys  welcome and things like that"". The people at the concession stands were fine. Just trying to rush each person through the line because everyone wants a drink which I didn't mind.   Quantity/Quality: Quantity in a sense of space and room there was plenty. Quality of course there was a great amount of time put into how a concert room should look.   Side Notes: Just like any concert general admission can be good and bad. good that you are close to the stage but bad when there are about 200 others making it hard to breath. I would personally pay the extra $30 to get a seat or upstairs side seat."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came for Lion Fight 18 Sept 5 2014. Great experience from start to finish. My 11 year old son thought everything was so cool and he had a blast. Staff seemed pretty friendly for the most part. Not really any bad seats unless you have a super tall person in front of you. We'll be back. I'm hoping to see a concert here in the future.   Bathrooms were clean. So that's always a bonus.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw The Black Crowes on 12/10/10.  Pros: Parking is easy  every seat in the house has a good view of the stage  and staff is helpful.  Cons: The sound for The Black Crowes was terrible.  Not sure if it was the venue or the mixing  but you couldn't make out a single word of the vocals and when the music got loud  everything came across as muffled.   Again  as this was my first show here  not sure if it was the venue or the sound guy  but I had to leave early it was so bad.  Other than that  the bands performance was great as well as the other positives I mentioned in the beginning.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Jim Jeffries there today. Good sound. The entire ground floor appears to have been folding chairs. Row DD  there was only one seat between us and Jim. There was a large full bar in the back. Location was drowned with model looking amazons. Double plus.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I've seen a few shows and been to some non-concert events like a Super Bowl party and the Fetish and Fantasy Ball.  This venue is fine for all that in my book.  Nothing extraordinaire.  Just a decent modern concert hall.  I'd much rather be here than the MGM Grand Garden Arena.    The VIP boxes are a nice  comfy way to go.   But you don't pay as much attention to the show since you end up interested in what food is coming out next  letting the servers know what you want to drink and bs'ing with other folks there.  The side tables are only good if they're comped.  They aren't worth the price.  I'd rather just be in the standing area above them.      It's a little less personal compared to The Pearl or House of Blues but if one of my favorite bands play here  I'm there.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"This was my first show at The Joint and I figured a fun-loving crowd would be in attendance for a Darius Rucker show.  To back up a bit  I bought our tickets on Vegas.com about a month in advance. A previous experience picking up Vegas.com tickets for Penn & Teller at Rio was awful and when I went to pick up Rucker tickets at Hard Rock  I just hoped I could do it without issue as I had a busy afternoon planned.  No problems at all! I was in and out in minutes with tickets in hand. (Memo to Rio: Get more people working the box office during afternoon hours or we won't bother with shows there  ok?)  It was a Saturday night show. Doors opened at 7pm. However  thanks to fellow Yelpers  I knew better than to show up early because of the price of drinks inside the venue. We drank at the Race & Sports Book instead and literally saved $9 per beer than what we would have paid inside The Joint.   Knowing Darius Rucker was in his dressing room watching the same Notre Dame-Florida State game we were at the Sports Book  we waited until the game ended before heading inside. (My friend even said  ""Darius ain't starting his set until this game ends. He's a football fan just like us!""  My friend was absolutely right and we walked in The Joint after the game ended and Darius took the stage about 15 minutes later.  Even if Darius had not closed the night with Purple Rain  I absolutely loved this venue for a show and it reminded me of some House of Blues venues in Chicago and Orlando...only about twice as big and very comfortable.  We bought the cheaper GA ticket  which offered plenty of viewing options as long as you were willing to be on your feet the entire show. I never even bothered going up near the stage  because the elevated area behind the reserved seating near the bars was perfect in terms of sightlines and sound. Bathrooms were also convenient  clean and large just around the corner from this standing room area.  Also  while this crowd was certainly rather mellow and not exactly looking for trouble  the staff is very aware of what is going on in the audience. Within a minute of us noticing a guy standing to our left almost pass out on his feet  security was there to efficiently remove him before he could potentially fall again and cause himself or others spilled drinks  conflict with others and/or injuries.  Sure  that $12 Budweiser is more appropriate for a pro sporting event  but I'm already looking at future show schedules for The Joint to plan a return on another Vegas trip after KISS finishes their run as the ""house band"" in November."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is an awesome place to see a concert!  The venue is small. There are 3 floors. No place is a bad area. If you want a seat you need a ticket for upstairs. General admission is on the first floor and its standing only.   I would recommend this place to anyone over seeing a concert at a large venue like MGM. You actually get to watch the performance instead of the big TV. Unless you are sitting in the back on the third floor then you might want to watch the tv. They have bars and restrooms so you don't leave the area. They have elevators for those who need to go up and can't use the stairs or escalators.   I've been here a few times usually standing on the first floor. This time we had seats. The seats are narrow so if you have a big booty like me it's a snug fit. They have cocktail servers going back and forth. Drinks are pricey just like any concert venue.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I like it here as a concert venue.  While other yelpers have voiced a negative opinion  I had a great experience watching the Guns N Roses concert here.  We purchased the floor tickets and had to stand the entire concert.  These were great tickets.  We got to stand up close to the stage and that is what I liked about it.  Being to able to get close and not pay an arm and a leg to do so.  I was expecting the floor to be packed and oversold but it was not the case.  Lots of elbow room.  Bathrooms are easy to get to and it wasn't a very long wait to get more beer.  I have no complaints about the sound system either.  If you want an up close view  I would recommend standing on the floor...  that is that what I will opt for again...
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I saw a concert here on January 2nd (Morrissey) and had a great experience. Venue staff initially seemed a bit disorganized  and unsure of how to handle the volume of fans queuing for the concert. However  everyone I dealt with was very polite  professional  and helpful. Ultimately  entering the venue was very organized and efficient. Security guards were also really nice.  The venue itself is nicely laid out. Good setup with large floor and multiple balcony levels where people can sit or stand. Good acoustics. Surprisingly large barrier  allowing at least 50 people front row. $14 for top shelf tequila soda. Free wifi! The concert itself was amazing  and far exceeded my expectations for a venue inside of a casino.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The great thing about this venue is that it gets acts that can pack stadiums but this place is about 1400 capacity. I like that they have non-smoking events cause Vegas can be soooo smokey that I get sick but that won't stop folks from lighting up anyway. Very crowded obviously and unless you like very pushy GA shows this would not be a good place to go  also shorter people have less view because of the GA. I personally love those type of shows but the fact that major acts that bring major more mainstream crowds frequent here  you get the mix of folks who have never been to small crowded shows and freak out when pushed or elbowed. Granted I am older now so the years in the Pit are pretty much over for me (OK I like chillin with my lady and she freaks when I jump into a windmill or lawnmower move with the energy from the music and someone next to her falls to the ground with a bloody nose he didn't see coming...sorry guy at The Used show) but I digress  we went to see Coheed and Cambria support Linkin Park over the weekend. Show was fun and although LP headlined I think CC was slightly the better or more impressive of the bands (sorry Mike and Brad I know we all went to AHS together but Claudio has such chops). Annoy where the girls who push to the front when we were 4 rows back  just by having drinks above their heads and acting so drunk that they looked like they would spill them on us if we tried to stop them. Also annoying was the girl who DID spill her drink down my back and later when I had a little pushing of my arms toward the people behind me decided to punch both me and some poor guy next to me  this was all during the opening act so I didn't wanna get thrown out for any bad behavior  I kindly offered to buy the lady another drink since ""I elbowed her in the stomach and caused her to spill it"" according to her  don't know what the other guy ""did"".....both my arms were around Deb at the time of said drink spill but what ever  let the show go on. Over all the show was wonderful and both band were very exciting. Venues can be hard to review when the bands are so good that they sound good in all venues.  If this was just a venue that got mediocre acts in it I would likely like it less but since it draws the big names I thought it is definitely a place to see a big band and all in Vegas no less....nice!!!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Just watched the new Axl Rose interview on That Metal Show on VH1 and traveled back in time to one of the greatest nights of my life....  September 16  2006. 11:15PM.  The Joint at The Hard Rock in Vegas.  A crowd of only 2 000. Waiting for Guns N' Roses to take the stage. My first GNR concert  ever.  Robin Finck finally walked onto the stage and rocked the eagerly waiting crowd with the opening riff of ""Welcome to the Jungle."" For what seemed to span an eternity  Robin teased the crowd with that riff. And just when our fragile little hearts couldn't take it anymore...the messiah himself  Mr. Axl Rose  belted out ""YOU KNOW WHERE THE F#%K YOU ARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRE??!""...and the crowd....went....absolutely...ape...you know what!! Including yours truly!  The following night  I came back to the same venue. Same band. Same set list. Rocked it out again for another 2.5 hours and it was like experiencing it for the first time.  Most memorable venue I've ever been to not just for its small size and good acoustics  but for making my dreams come true...  ...Paradise City it became."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Really like this venue  been here a multitude of times to see a bunch of different bands. I choose GA seats cause at a rock show you shouldn't be sitting down. The venue is pretty clean they have a really great sound system as well as great lighting  the wait between band changes is fairly short. Drink prices are a little high but i go for the music. The crowd can get a little rowdy but security is usually on top of things if someone get's out of line and starts being too much of a jackass. This is a place to see some of the big and popular bands   I prefer Vinyl for an more intimate and up close experience but this is definitely in my top 5 venues in vegas.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,There are lots of things to like about the Joint.    1) Small/Medium venue that is cozy enough there probably isn't a bad seat in the house.  2) They have a a great big bar on the bottom level with not too badly priced beers and drinks....for Vegas....and a concert venue....  3) The seats are comfy enough (although you don't really use them during the concert) and they provide you a good view of the stage if on the floor. Plus they have waitresses come take your order if you don't want to schlep to the bar.    Now some of the things I don't care for are that the seats on the bottom level (or everywhere maybe) are not fixed.  They are kind of flimsily bolted down and if you are at a particularly wild show (like Motley Crue) people tend to knock them out of place and they end up all over!    Also  I really don't know how great the acoustics are in the Joint.  When we saw Crue 1/2 the song were frikken amazing  pitch perfect  rock out awesome.  However  the other half seemed like either Vince Neil  his mic or the sound crew were having major troubles.  Not sure if that is the venue  the singer or what - so they lose a star.   I would go back  without hesitation.  Its a nice joint!  And Crue rocked in the end  slight sound hiccups aside!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Love the location. From most entrances in the casino your at the box office pretty quickly. Once the doors open they get you inside pretty fast. The balcony seating is nice and soft  doesnt hurt the ass. Not sure if all concerts have it here but it was open bar for a Hour when i seen Dj Tiesto. Glad it was  the drink i paid for came to 14 Damn Dollars. Which seemed expensive to me  even by Concert standards. Good lighting and the sound system is good as well. The Taxi line was long as hell  they could do a better job at managing it. But walk straight up Harmon and your back on the strip. So i would skip the cab.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I've been to this venue several times including the opening night of the newly renovated Joint for the Killers show last year. Ironically it this was either the first night or the last night of their tour. With the added bonus that the Killers are actually from Vegas  it made for a pretty wicked time.   But onto the venue itself...  This is one of those places that even though it's standing room/GA for (I think) most music shows  there really isn't a bad place to see. It's spacious enough to dance and move around without stepping on other people.  The bar line gets really busy and can take a long  long time to get drinks. Boo.  I'm not a huge Hard Rock casino fan though and in my opinion that's The Joint's only real downfall. A wee bit of douche factor going on.  You know  those kind of people who desperately want to be seen... The lineup to get in to the Joint is crazy and there isn't much room to move. This place gets hella-busy after a show and it takes forever to get a cab (the taxi line is insane!) so prepare for a long wait. The casino floor is small and cramped compared to the other Vegas casinos so hanging out after a show is kinda hard if rubbing up against skeezy looking club chicks/wannabe porn actresses isn't exactly your thing.  Overall though  The Joint is a great venue and I never hesitate to buy tickets for shows here. Especially when you really  really like the bands. Though the venue can house a lot of people  it still has a somewhat intimate vibe to see your favorite bands all up close and personal.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue to watch a show - I saw Prince perform and it was great to see him in a more intimate setting...whether you're upfront close to the artist/act or in the back or balcony section  the sound is fantastic.  It'd be great to watch other performances here...
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Huge venue and hardly any seating for GA? What the feez.... I came for Tiesto In Concert and you'd only imagine how packed that was. There were only people seated on this leveled platform against the wall on opposite ends of the dance floors and then this one platform dividing the VIP tables and the bar against the back.  My friends and I got in without wait  right away and were able to walk in and out of the venue.  Maybe if there were seats around... i'd give this place a fourth star.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I haven't been to a show at the Joint in almost a decade  it has been renovated since then and seems to look better.   We went with friends to the Queens of the Stone Age concert. They were great live despite me leaving thoroughly in pain and angry at the assholes in the GA area.   The venue is pretty decently sized. The floor has the usual front pit area and then there are standing areas separated by rails and are slightly raised. There is a balcony area which has seating and on the side of the balcony are vip tables and also areas to stand and hangout too. Of course there's a bar  but I didn't drink anything so I cannot comment on prices or selection other than a friend being so pleased they had Zima.  The sound was pretty good in there. It was balanced and not reverb or too loud.   Didn't deal too much with the staff. They werent circulating the crowd and stopping people from being asshats  but if you vape they were inside your ass in seconds about it. I also got in trouble for having bottled water and had to pour it into a plastic cup.   I think I am just too salty and old for the shenanigans of the Pit and I've been blessed and spoiled that it was actually my first (and last) time in the mill of things. I'm sure I'll see a show again here but from a seat. I'll review again once that happens. For now A-OK.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is a nice venue. We came here July 4th for Mike Epps comedy show. Its a nice place to have a small concert or show. They had seats on the bottom and up top on the balcony..if I remember correctly  it looked like there were tables and chairs up top but maybe it was just for that night.  They had a big ass bar but only like 5 ppl working with at least 500 +ppl in the venue so the wait was a lil long but once I got my drink  it was YUMMY!   The only thing I didn't like is it was FREEZING in there! I understand its July and its 100 outside but damn! Turn the  AC down a lil! Sheesh! Also  the space btwn the rows were hella small  Im a small girl but I felt like I could barely get through and of course we sat in the middle of our row lol smh.  Overall good venue! Will def go back for another show.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This place was huge-- three floors  big VIP section  huge pit!  We came to see Tiesto and had bottle service.  I don't think I would have lasted very long if we hadn't had our own space.  Every time we needed to go to the bathroom and go into the general area  it was chaotic  people bumping into each other etc.  Entry for VIP and bottle service was very organized and impressive.  It was quick and we were at our table pretty quickly after checking in.  We had a great space to dance  with a couch  table and drinks.    People around us were chill.  Servers/bussers were attentive and security was tight and they dealt with issues (mainly a really drunk girl who puked everywhere at the table next to us) quickly and professionally.  It made the night run smoothly.    The show was great and lasted longer than we expected  which was great.  We took a taxi home and  walked to the next spot to avoid the RIDICULOUS lines at the Hard Rock.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Want to see Dave Gahan's leather jacket (at least a replica)?  Go here. There was a Sony release party for a computer game about pirates  there were milkshakes and firebreathing ladies but I missed all them. Lots of blue and red lights if you're into that kind of thing.  One time Bill Maher played there with Van Halen.  There are Prince quotes in raised Comic Sans font on the way out and slots.  The ladiez are required to wear asscrack-showing leather panties and fishnetz.  The Joint...at Hard Rock!!!  Nice sound system  loud  but clear...like a cold desert night.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Just saw GNR on New Year's Eve at the Joint. I liked the venue  perfect size (holds 4000 at max)  absolutely great sound system. Make that a phenomenal sound system. Entry was organized and easy. Drink prices are ridiculous but they always are at concerts so that is nothing new.  My main (and only) complaint is that the Joint allows smoking. Is that not a fire hazard? We were surrounded by smokers so our clothes stink and it was hard to breathe at times. I cannot believe that in the 21 century there are still venues that allow smoking. I guess the management never heard of the dangers and annoyance of second hand smoke.   Anyway  it's a great venue and I would love to see more concerts there. Next time I will bring a ventilator.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,We came to see a boxing match. We have seen every fight in LV for the last 3 years  excluding Mayweather. No concession stand-meaning they only sell drinks  every seat was a good seat  they do not allow you to bring water in(no cups to pour it in)  beer is $13 to $15  a glass of ice and about 4 oz of soda costs $5 so we bought soda instead of water. We had to leave to get something to eat at the cafe and they told us that we would not be allowed to bring the sodas back in even though we just  bought them there so we had to ask the bartender to put them behind the bar. Staff was very friendly. But when our view became completely obstructed because a rather large man decided to stand up security told me that he paid for his seat too so he can stand if he wants to.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to th Guns and Roses show here.  Great performance/staging/sound at a really cool venue.  We had seats on the floor section  fairly comfortable for folding chairs. Never had been to the joint prior  nice medium sized concert hall. Bought some gnr specialty drinks  bartender didn't even know about till we gave her their menu.  Great drinks for $8. Only negative here was the entrance line which took you on a hike for about 1/2 hour and was disorganized.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,My rocker wife and I just got back from seeing Def Leppard and have to say I was impressed.  First off  they let me bring in my own beer which was a really good thing considering they charge $12 for a bud light!   I learned that the hard way when I went to replenish and fortify.   Great concert  great sound system and the seating is done well.  We had people traipsing back and forth in front of us so we moved to the seats behind us with no fuss from the staff.   All in all  a good concert experience.  Just smuggle when it comes to drinks or you'll take it in the pooper!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This place is great to see music at.  I have seen Them Crooked Vultures and Santana here.  This place is okay for boxing  which I have seen here countless times over the last four years  and it is horrid for MMA.  I have been to three MMA events at the Joint; none of them started on time.  Instead of posting when the event would start  they just had you stand in line.  Which is really dumb because if I knew I had an hour or two to kill  I would go find a bar  or gamble  or find someway to spend money in the casino.  I really like the offerings at the bar; I wish they had a better food selection though.  I prefer seeing boxing at MGM  MB  or a Stations casino  but this place is built for music and is a great place to see music.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came here on free tixs from channel 8 to see Santana this is the first time I was inside this place and it was rockin  there were some bummers...But the good things were  easy to get in and find our seat. The bathroom upstairs was pretty clean. Santana  and his band were fantastic sound system was loud but not distorted. The bummers were- my cousin got stuck sitting to next to a guy who practically overflow into her seat? He was one big guy  who should of sat somewhere else as the seats are quite small? The bar was slightly crowded but went fast  but the drinks were very pricey in a plastic cup as you are looking to spent at least $12 or more a drinks so bring your credit cards pl us we bought potato chips @ $4 a bag for the small ones we were hungry so we did not have any option at this point? fyi I would go back as I had balcony seat and they were decent you can see the stage pretty well.But I will refrain from having any cocktails unless it is open bar...
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I've been to The Joint 3 times--once in the old Joint and twice in the newer  enlarged Joint.  For the current Joint  the flow of people in and out was well designed but I wonder why they didn't install a reversible escalator so part of the crown could go downstairs that way and the rest by stairs.  For this concert of KISS  I got balcony seating.  I liked it better than floor seating because I found the floor seating to be very tightly packed next to each other.  The balcony on the other hand had theatre style seats that were comfortable.  The sound and lighting in the Joint are exceptional.  Needless to say  KISS had a lot of pyro effects and the lighting was great.  It would be nice if they could have raised the catwalk.  It was in the way for some of the stage viewing.  There aren't too many shows that I would go here to see but if I went again  I'd try to get a table seat on the side balconies.  As a tip  park in the Paradise garage for easy access to the Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"We just saw Kenny Chesney play at the Joint and we had a great time.  This was my first time at this venue but there are several things I liked about it.  First  we stayed at the Hard Rock  so walking downstairs to grab dinner then walk across the hall to the show was an amazing convenience especially in Vegas.  There was a long line when we arrived but the line moved incredibly quick and we were inside the theater in no time.  The bar lines were quite long and moved extremely slow  but the drinks were reasonably priced and I felt were poured fairly.  The theater is small and for this concert is was general admission only (it might be that way for every show  not sure).  We stood in the back and I felt we were still close enough to say we had a very good view and I don't think there is a bad ""seat"" in the place.  We were not cramped or crowded either.  I would definitely come back for another show."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,A lot bigger than I expected! General admission/Standing room only. . .the only way to go! Went here to see Silversun Pickups a few weeks ago. Bought my ticket an hour before the show. I've been to many  many venues but this one is definitely somewhere near the top of my list.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is a great venue for catching touring acts.  The main floor is large and they have railings to divide up the further areas.  It is nice to have something to lean against and a sense that you will not be trampled.  We stood just to the side of the mixing station and  of course  the sound was excellent.    I realize that there is very little/no seating  but I don't mind standing through a show. Drinks were pricey  but they are always expensive at these kinds of places.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,One of the best venues and music bang for your buck!  For $72 we saw Ice Cube  LLCoolJ  Dela Soul and Public Enemy.  We were able to get close enough to reach out and touch them!  Well...if we could get passed the bouncers!  We proceeded to get right in front of the stage while LLCoolJ was rapping.    General Admission was $72 (standing room only) Tables are $100 and VIP is $200.  I recommended General Admission if you want to be up close and personal with the artist.   All in all an excellent deal.  Plenty of elbow room for dancing.  I recommended comfortable shoes and not heels ladies...  The drinks were pricey  but my best advice is to drink before you arrive.  Would I see another concert here? YES! Would I get their in time for the opening act second time around? YES! Would I see the #KOTMT again? Hell ya!  Unfortunately we missed the 2 opening acts  Dela Soul and Public Enemy.  However LLCoolJ and Ice Cube  rocked the bells!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,if you lucky enough to see a good band or singer this place is the bomb :)
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I have been to many shows here and always loved the venue. I went to Brian Wilson on July 1st and was really disappointed at the changes I noticed. The security staff has gotten really aggressive and the ""ushers""  (or whatever the PC title is these days)  were not cool. I used to wander around the place during the show when I went solo and never had a problem. This time was very different. I had a balcony seat and when I went downstairs to hang at the big bar I was told to ""get back up to the balcony""  after this clearly not customer friendly service woman demanded to see my ticket. I said I just was going to the bar and she was not having it. I don't know what changed but I have NEVER had anyone stop me from hanging there for awhile.     I still give the place 3 stars because the venue is really nice and just what you want for a concert. I hope they rethink their policy or whatever changed to restrict people from upstairs coming to the bar downstairs. I mean they have ushers stationed at each aisle so if you don't have a seating ticket for that section you will be directed elsewhere. But to keep people from mingling at the bar that come from upstairs ??? Bad bad decision. Or maybe that woman was just ignorant. I hope that is the case. When you go solo half the fun is hanging out with others. Especially in this town."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Arcade Fire here last night. Line moved really fast. We had floor seats. The sound was amazing and Arcade Fire did great. They kept kicking on the ac every now and then so I didnt get too hot like most venues.  The only issue I had was with my bartender  she was too cool for school and was in a very bad mood. I closed my tab with her because shewas so rude. Also the security kept walking back n forth in front of us and were very rude also.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,We just arrived to see a a rock concert and we had a horrible experience  one of  the security guard was very rude to my wife calling her nasty old woman.  I'm disabled and we are not young to get treated like that and when I asked to talk to a manager I got the the run  around   SHAM ON YOU TO HAVE PEOPLE LIKE THAT WORKING FOR A NICE VENUE
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I have been coming to concerts at The Joint since they opened so long ago! This is truly the best venue to see a show for many reasons. #1 - The location is centrally located in the valley. #2 - It is accessible from the 215 freeway which means you do not have to set foot on the strip! #3 - Easy parking in the two parking garages which are located on Harmon and Paradise! #4 - The venue is easy to find and you don't have to walk through a throng of people to get to it. #5 - Incredible acoustics from every angle. #6 - Not a bad seat or standing location  you can see from all levels although I am partial to the main floor since you can really feel the music at this level.  I still have a soft spot in my heart for the original Joint which was a smaller venue and way more intimate. I have seen some incredible shows under this roof. I am happy that they expanded though as a lot more room to move around and get into the concert. Overall I can only tell you that this venue is the best in town to let it all go and rock out!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,SPLITBREED performed at the Joint on July 4th. Security was friendly and helpful. Staff was great but the place was understaffed for the event. Nice green rooms as well. By far the best venue in vegas  and we have played in most major hotels!  http://facebook.com/splitbreed
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw the Tiesto concert there sound was great. Nice clean place no line to get in friendly staff and bartenders.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Lastig om een review van een concertzaal te geven. Wat beoordeel je? Geluid  programmering  veiligheid  drank en eten? Eigenlijk alles bij elkaar. Dus een paar observaties. Omdat ik sommige dingen vooral vergelijk met onze NL'se ervaringen een review in het Nederlands. Kan ook  er zijn er genoeg in het Engels.  Vanzelfsprekend een super programmering. Grote namen in rock en soms ook gewoon commercieel. Dingen waarvan je je afvraagt of ze het Hard Rock Hotel publiek aantrekken. Maar zal wel geld opleveren.  Wij hebben hier Guns and Roses and Five Finger Death Punch met Papa Roach gezien. Beide super concerten (met dank aan de artiesten). Goed geluid (dank aan de toko). Veilig gevoel (dank aan de toko). Is toch het soort publiek dat nog wel eens een feestje bouwt. Dat kan hier  maar wel veilig. Tussen elke 4-5 rijen staan op heuphoogte stalen...tsja....beugels? In ieder geval iets dat een scheiding tussen het publiek aanbrengt. Je drukt elkaar dus niet aan. Als de beveiliging het vol vindt wordt er niemand meer toegelaten. En geloof me  in NL zouden er nog minimaal 2x meer mensen in mogen. Je hebt dus echt de ruimte.  En de Amerikanen zijn vriendelijk. Even weg voor drankje betekent dat je plekje gewoon open blijft. Geen geduw en getrek. Overigens brengen ze dat bier ook langs. Ipv $13 betaal je dan $15 zonder tip. Slik. Typisch Amerikaans. Maar het scheelt wel een enorme lange rij. Die de hele avond voor de bar staat. Laten bezorgen dus. Verdienen die meisjes ook nog wat.  De zaal in en uit verloopt telkens soepel. Je moet alleen je kaartje bij je houden als je de vloer verlaat (voor bijvoorbeeld drank of het toilet). Alles bij elkaar zijn wij fan.  Tot slot vonden de prijzen van de kaartjes wel ok. Voor FFDP rond de $45. Nette prijs voor een hele avond entertainment.  Klein minpuntje waar ze mogelijk wel invloed op hebben  maar niets aan kunnen doen. Na zo'n concert willen veel mensen tegelijk weg. En The Strip is toch wel een tippeltje. De rijen voor de taxi's zijn enorm. Echt enorm. Wij lopen altijd terug richting The Signature. Precies 1 blok. 's Nachts prima te doen. Alternatief kan Uber zijn.  Update 2016: we waren hier deze keer niet voor een concert  maar een bij lange na niet uitverkochte show van een stand-up comedian. Overigens een hele slechte (David Cross)  maar daar gaat het niet om. Relevant is de airco. Die kent blijkbaar alleen het standje 'volle zaal  concert'. Kortom: half doodgevroren .
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Pretty cool venue to catch an act. This is a newer version of the old spot  a thousand years ago I attended a Montel Jordan concert there and found the original to be even more intimate. Anyways this place is larger but not huge where you're not able to see the act. We had middle section seats and they were great. The bar area was easy to maneuver in too  not packed at all. The bathrooms were also clean and had an old school touch to them with an attendant offering things like mints and perfume. I was able to see Jamie Foxx and his special guests and left very satisfied. The only negative is getting out of the joint (haha)  they herd you into the casino which is way too small and you feel claustrophobic.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I remember the very first show at the Joint. My dad was lucky enough to attend at sat next to Jack Nickelson and he will tell the story a million times. The new Hard Rock music venue in Vegas! Well  let's just say this review is a little more up to date.  Since opening in the late 90's  the Joint has renovated  yet still keeping the sound distinguished and the setting intimate. Before the renovation I seen shows like  No Doubt  Alicia Keys  John Legend  and even a fair share of punk shows.  My most recent experience was a little more old school with Cheech & Chong and the band WAR. They kept the 3 level high ceiling  however floor 2 is more VIP than it use to be. About 8 private booths with comfy chairs  and then seats with tables and waitress's along the side overlooking the stage. GREAT layout. The 3rd floor is a bit higher up than I remember  but still a great view. The floor you have the option for G/A or seating depending on the show. And the sound  better than ever before! I was very impressed when War got down on ""Low Rider"" and the bass was still nice and clean. My only complaint  the uppity staff! Dude were at WAR AND CHEECH & CHONG  PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE SMOKING POT!!!  We had his one security guard who we called ""Johnny Bravo"" cuz he kept walking by with his chest out sniffing us like he was a K-9. Get over yourself bro.  Other than that  I can't wait to see another show here! Hopefully Mr. Bravo himself will be working again to add to the entertainment."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"We have been here 3 times for concerts: twice to see Rascal Flatts (2015 and Feb 2016) and once for Kenny Chesney (2015).   The best thing about this place is that it's a smaller venue compared to a Staples Center or large ampitheater.   We had great seats towards the front for both Rascal Flatts shows (which my BF prefers) and open standing right next to the stage for Kenny Chesney (which I thought was cool because we were so close to Kenny - he was like right there)!   Overall  we really like The Joint and have always stayed at the Hard Rock as well since it's very convenient. If you stay at the hotel for the show  they will give you ""VIP"" passes to get first entry when they open the doors. This proved to be advantageous for the Kenny show because everyone that had open standing rushed to the stage to stake out a good spot.   The only complaints I have about this spot are:  1) Drink prices are high -- $12 for vodka/soda and $6 for a plain 'ol soda. 2) The folding seats are not comfortable and very small so you're praying a large person doesn't sit beside you.   I end up standing and dancing for a lot of the show  so it's all good any which way.   I'm sure this will be a place we will return to throughout the years for many more incredible shows!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,A great place to see a concert! Even the nose bleed seats here are decent. The acoustics sound great. The tickets here are normally not too overpriced like other venues in town. I would prefer this place to see a show as compared to the larger venues here. It's a much more intimate setting and you're not really far from the stage.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Here is what The Joint is good at: bringing in great live acts and charging an outrageous amount of ""fees"" and ""entertainment taxes"" on said acts. Here is what The Joint is bad at: everything else. I had a moderate like for it when it was in the old space-granted it was much smaller but it gave the intimate feel that you don't often get with the acts that they have the pull to bring in. The new space (which has been open for about four years or so) is large and accommodating but has a gross corporate feel that I'm assuming is due to the Hard Rock trying to revamp it's image and appeal to people who don't live here. I get it. It's just sad that their music venue had to suffer as a result.   They're a typical Strip venue- douchey security  overpriced drinks  big screens for those of us not fortunate to score front row seats or those of us too over it to push our way to the front of the crowd in a GA situation.  The acoustics are pretty good-they better be for the price I pay to get in.   One thing I've noticed is that their ushers have always been really nice. Overall  just an average concert hall that doesn't really deserve half the acts that they're able to bring in."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I am not sure I would have honestly ever gone to this place if it had not been for Angel Management Group and a promotion they did Independence day wknd; giving away tables at the Joint to see Tiesto. We had seen him at EDC and pretty much figured that was stellar and would use our resources elsewhere. However  I won a table through the promotion and we went. The nights Tiesto is there  are insane. The line is around the casino area where the club is all the way around into the back hall and so on. When they pointed us in that direction for the VIP line  I almost fell out cause we kept walking and the line didn't end. Finally I found a security and asked if we were walking the right line? He responded  ""Oh no ma'am the VIP is still around the corner up that way  PAST the line. WHEW!! So we got to the little opening where they do VIP and there were a handful of ppl there waiting to be seated. We met up with our check in person  got tickets  stamps and table wristbands and were then escorted up. They have a couple of different levels that look down on the ""arena"" area. We were on the second floor on the right hand side of the stage. We had a small table but an awesome view. Tiesto rocked the Joint and we stayed til they rolled the carpets up at 4am. It was an amazing time  like no other and we are so grateful to Angel Mgmt for the great evening with Tiesto."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Def Leppard here- this show was one of the best shows I have ever been to! The venue is amazing- The Joint is small enough to allow everyone- even the people in the very back- to see the entire stage up close! Glad I stood in the back- the floor seating was pretty tight  and there is plenty of leaning room in the back  where you can still see the whole stage and the 3 screens showing great shots of all the guys. Def Leppard still rocks after all these years  and they have never sounded better. They play a new setlist every night before they reach intermission  after which they play the entire Hysteria album. Definitely a once in a lifetime event!! Had an amazing time  wish I could have gone to more than one night!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Fantastic venue for music. Every seat is a good seat. It's pretty intimate  yet you don't feel smothered or crowded even with general admission. Of course the Hard Rock is iconic in itself as a Vegas venue if you want the rocker crowd.  Drinks are priced stiff... but hey  it's Vegas right?
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to see Arcade Fire here last night. was excited to check out the Joint since they moved it when remodeling Hard Rock. Saw a bunch of shows at the old one  but haven't got to too many shows since my kids were born.   Had balcony seats which I expected to allow me to go onto the floor also  but it seems they charge more for that and keep you separated. Could have snuck on but whatever. Went up to balcony  back to our seats in 401 Row J seats 7 8 and after the first 2 songs sounding like DJ train wrecking  I thought either Arcade Fire got wasted in Vegas or the sound is sooooo bad in those seats. I had a feeling it was the latter as no speakers were close and it seemed like a lot of reverb getting in the way.   So we got up and walked up front to an opening by the railings on side  were we walked into balcony area. Much better sound. Better view too. Stayed there for rest of the show which was great. Arcade Fire was awesome live and sounded great in new spot.   The floor looked mobbed but I assume sounded good down there too. All in all there is nothing special or exciting about this place as a concert venue  and I would recommend either getting floor or standing up front in balcony. They need to buy separate speakers for balcony seats in back. Very Lame for someone who might not have known it was just bad place to be sound wise.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Went to see the ""Not So Silent Night"" tour with Train  Better than Ezra etc.  The concerts were amazing and sound was great!  My only arguement is this was my first Joint concert where there was assigned seating.  We got there a little late being that the first two concerts we didnt need to see.  When we were shown our seats (they were on the floor-row MM) they were in the middle of the row.  The chairs were so jammed packed in there that its almost impossible to get to your seat without interrupting everone around you.  Most of the row had to move out of the row so that we could find our seats.    I don't know...I dont have much complaints as I loved the show.  Absolutely amazing....but God forbid if you need to go to the bathroom or grab a beer.  Be prepared to stay in your seats!  You would almost think it would be a hazard to be that packed in.  Anyways  love the Joint especially when yo"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The Joint has grown  and not in a good way.  I was at the Joint two years ago: saw Modest Mouse and was stunned at the size of the venue. It was teeny tiny  so there were zero bad seats in the whole house. It was delightfully grungy. I left that experience vowing to see more shows there due to the intimate setting.  Not anymore. The Joint is a giant soulless loading dock. Take out the screen and you could park a small fleet of naval cruisers and warships inside. You could even stack them due to the amazing amount of wasted space above the ground seating. The Balcony is so far back they should have never left home. The decor says ""upgraded high school gym"". I don't know what this space used to be  but it was clearly not designed primarily for live music.  Also the beer on tap is just awful crap and Shock Top which is pretending to not be awful crap but totally is all the same.   Some positives: Large Screens so the people waaaaaaaaaaaay in the back can see the performer. Yay! Helpful bar staff  and wait staff taking the orders of people already seated (not during the show  but before.) The ability to taunt your less attentive friends (""Haha your seats are back there? I'm all the way up here! Look how much closer I am!"").   You can see music and get booze here  so it can't be all bad  but in a place that considers itself to be the Temple of Music in Las Vegas- I'd be ashamed.  The House of Blues does a much better version of this in an establishment that has a lot more character- and it's a chain restaurant."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This was my first time at The Joint and I had a great experience. I ended up with two tickets for the Prince late show on April 27 on accident  but the venue was very accommodating in help me switch one of the tickets to the early show( neither show was sold out) through Ticketmaster (who were giving me a ridiculously hard time). It was an intimate venue and there really is no bad seat. The security were really nice  even joking with us since we had been in line for such a long time. I would definately come to this venue again as this was one of the best concert experiences I have had!!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Cool concert joint. Very intimate setting  and every seat has a great view. Bars are efficient  and the lady in the bathroom is a great addition.   Santana put on a great show  with a variety of performers and visual effects chiming in  including Orianthe  that girl who in the Michael Jackson movie  and one of the guys from the Doors. My dad knew every song and was delighted to be there  despite the excruciatingly expensive tickets.   My only major complaint was the taxi situation. The Hard Rock isn't on the Strip  and why would we rent a car in Vegas? After the concert  the taxi line had maybe 200 people in it within five minutes  and the doormen were only loading ONE taxi at a time. Seriously people  do you not throw several concerts a week? We walked the mile and a half back to the Paris  ruining my shoes on all the gravel in the process  rather than wait an hour for a taxi after a 2.5 hr concert.   Cool venue  but definitely make sure you arrange a ride back to the Strip in advance.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Located in the Hard Rock Casino/Hotel  it's easy to find coming in from the parking garage.  It's an average size venue used not just for concerts but also conventions.    As far as venues go  The Joint is not one of my favorites in Vegas.  The sound could be better for the entertainers.  There is a lot of background noise from the open area bar behind the seating.  Kind of distracting from the show.    As for the seating  very uncomfortable chairs with little leg room.  The seats are cheap removable folding chairs since this venue is used for other events. I think it would almost be better to just have a general admission standing floor without the seats.    It will have to be a really great show to want to see one here again.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I've been to the old Joint dozens of times.  In my opinion  it used to be an almost perfect venue.    I've only been there one time since the remodel  and I was not a fan.  The place is huge now!  The sound is great  but the venue is so impersonal.  It reminds me of a tiered cement parking lot with metal railings in between the tiers to separate people.  I've passed on some of my favorite bands just because I knew they were playing here  and I had no interest in returning.  It would take a hell of a band to get me back into The Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Visited this venue last night to see RASCAL FLATTS in concert! I enjoyed everything about this place! staff was very warm  and friendly. Everyone was very accommodating  directed me to my seats no problem. The concert was AMAZING!!! Experience was a 10! Every seat is a great seat! Will be visiting this place again soon!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,First of all  don't be deceived by the exterior of this joint.. no pun intended. Or is there? Jk. But really  don't be fooled because this place is freakin' HUGE. There's the main floor  which has a bar at the very back  and about two upper levels with tables! If you're familiar with the Bill Graham Civic Center in San Francisco  this place is very similar. I came here from the Bay to see Drake perform last month and Weezy's surprise guest performance was epic and meeting Drake after the show was definitely the cherry topper to one of the best nights of my life. I'm not sure if all events here are general admission but if they are  I suggest an early arrival if you plan to be in the very front. Like all general admission concerts  don't even bother being on the main floor if you don't like crowds but if you're like me and want the most personal  intimate experience possible with your favorite performer  get your ass in line early. One con about this venue was the security. They would not allow us to stand outside of the venue and kept telling us different times that we could start lining up. When that time came  they told us a later time and next thing you know  there's two different lines going on.. at two different ends of the venue! Ay yi yi.. but overall  I'm a fan of this place. I believe there's a bar on each floor which screams convenience so you don't have to go up and down or stand in a ridiculously long line for a drink. Sounds were great  atmosphere is modern and vibes are chill  and there's even elevators and a pretty dope main staircase at the entrance. I wouldn't mind attending another event here but let's see if the next performer is worth my drive like Drizzy was..
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I went to the Tiesto show on July 2.  It was my first time there and I don't think I would go back for an EDM show.  The feeling was waaaaay too corporate.  The bartenders could not handle the crowd and when one bartender made a vodka tonic after my boyfriend asked for vodka monster  she wouldn't correct the error.  There was also was a crazy female security guard in the bathroom that was shaking people down. No bueno.  I heart Tiesto so his show was sick but I will stick to rock shows at The Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,so it's closing...went here for the farewell send off this past friday - MOTLEY f*$king CRUE!!!!!!!  they kicked some serious arse! played a ridic long set  touched on some new  but mostly the old goodies that we all wanted to hear! i was blown away!  the venue reminds me of the wiltern...intimate enough to truly enjoy the show...good sound system  glad i got the check out this spot before it was too late!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I am a big fan of The Joint.  The venue is not gigantic so you can see the stage from wherever you are sitting. The attendants who guard the seating area are a little crazy...I think I had 3 people check my ticket within 2 minutes.  I sat up in the suites where we had a great server who kept our drink order running  but the drinks were incredibly expensive  way over priced.  And a big big bummer  they dont serve food.  Who doesn't serve food to a bunch of people who are drinking!!?  And the event was from 2:30pm to 9pm.  They could have made a killing with just nachos  pretzels and hot dogs.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"what a great space.  on a whim  got tickets to see Sarah Silverman here last night.  And even SRO tix at the back of the Joint were great for seeing a show.  Comedy  music  whatever - would be great here.  The only thing I would change?  The drunk schmucks in the audience.  I have never been to a show that has had so much heckling  talking  shouting - constant bullshit - and from an 8:00pm show.  I am not sure if the casino brought in people to fill the seats  or the paying customers were just the arsewipes that they were - but I felt embarrassed and ashamed that I was one of these people.  Granted  the set wasn't perfect - but it didn't deserve the 'audience participation' that it got.  My friend said ""that's what happens when you play Vegas - tough crowd""  The crowd wasn't ""tough"" - they were a flock of douchebags - and if this is what a typical crowd is  then I will stick to seeing acts elsewhere - it really ruins it for those of us that want to actually experience what's on stage."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I have a love/hate relationship with The Joint. I miss the old  smaller  more intimate version. I think the experience here will really depend on the show and who else is in attendance. Most shows are general admission  so if you get stuck standing by some real assholes  you can always move....unless it's super crowded. Or unless you are near the front and don't won't to give up prime real estate. I usually hang out somewhere midway back. I don't think it's worth throwing elbows to be up close  and I like having easier access to the bar. ;) Speaking of which  they should be ashamed of their beer selection. Bud  Bud Light and Shock Top? Really? That's IT? Barf. At least there are a lot of windows and service tends to move pretty quickly.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I had never been to The Joint before so I didn't really know what to expect. My friend and I bought general admission tickets to see Journey perform. The show was scheduled for 8 p.m. so we arrived 30 minutes prior. We were surprised to see that a long line had already formed but it moved along fairly quick. The GA seating was in the back and divided by railings. Is it for crowd control? Who knows  but it was easy to navigate through the crowd and we had ample space to move around. The bar is located towards the back but cocktail servers can be found among the crowd taking orders and bringing them right to you. There is a bathroom inside The Joint towards the front with plenty of stalls  so you never have to wait for one to become available.   The acoustics in the venue sounded great  but if you're sensitive like me  do not eat before the show. Each time the bass would hit  I would start feeling queasy. Nevertheless I still had a great time. Journey put on a great show and we had an easy exit both out of the venue and parking lot.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Santana last week in the newly refurbished Joint and was very impressed.  The place is beautiful  the acoustics are top notch..... I've seen many shows prior to the renovation and in my opinion  the Hard Rock did a very good job.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I am so ridiculously torn on this review  you have no idea. If I had written this review last week  it would probably be 5 stars and read as follows:  The Joint is a fantastic 1400 person capacity venue that is by far one of my favorite places in Vegas to see a show. I have been to several shows here and have enjoyed every single one. I love the intimate feeling they manage to create despite your being in the center of a Vegas casino and the large acts they manage to pull in despite the venue's small size.   Ok  but see  I didn't write this a week ago  or after any of the previous shows i have seen there  but rather am doing so after having just been there this past Friday to see the Foo Fighters. I will say that the show was A-MAZING  but that's pretty standard for the Foo and having been the second smallest venue in which I've been able to see them  this should have been a ridiculously perfect night. Thanks to the staff at the Joint (and one bouncer in particular) though  it was far from it. Yes  my friend and I had drank our fair share of wine at Ago before the show but we are not obnoxious drunks by nature  and considering we're in Vegas  probably seemed pretty mild in comparison. The trick to this venue is that you have to exit into the casino to use a restroom  and  with that much liquid in our bellies  frequent trips to this casino bathroom were necessary. On my friend's first trip  she made ""friends"" with a bouncer that was guarding the path between the 2  he asked for her ticket stub (despite the fact that our hands were also stamped) and she happily showed him her ticket while introducing herself to him.  His name was George and it turns out he's a complete a**hole! On my friend's second trip to the bathroom  I joined her  so she introduced me to her new friend on our way back in. When he asked me for my ticket  I enthusiastically replied back ""I've got my ticket  let's go see the show  whooo!"" in a mildly raised voice  to which he shockingly replied ""yell at me again and I'll throw you out!""  Uh.... excuse me?????????  When my friend departed for bathroom trip number 3 a mere 4 songs into the Foo Fighters' set  well that was the end of her night in the Joint. Turns out she set her ticket stub on the counter to wash her hands and it was gone when she went back in to grab it. But  as George  who knew her freaking name and had seen her twice and could see that her hand was stamped  was still watching the ropes  she figured things were ok. Nope  he refused to let her back into the venue and actually physically escorted her outside!!!!!! Now when even his boss who we met a little too late and a couple of his co-workers who approached us after the show all agreed that the guy was being ridiculous in not letting her back in  well there's a problem here.  When we spend $80 each on tickets to a freaking ROCK show and are not involved in any sort of fighting or illegal activity I just don't expect a probably under-endowed assclown to take out his aggression on a girl who was actually being pretty friendly to him just because he has a velvet rope in his hand.  I still give the Joint 4 stars because it was clearly an issue of just this one prick but he sure left a very sour taste in my mouth."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,wow....don't ever get a suite. pay $170 a person  for 12 people and the server will maybe take a drink order once every 4 rounds. then when the tab comes she argues with us in public about how she deserves a 20% tip and won't stop until we pay her.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,As far as event venues are  the staffs at The Joint are highly efficient and nice.  With that said  I was so bored at Tiesto's concert.  Don't get me wrong  Tiesto's music is phenomenal but by the time he came out around at 12:45am  I was in a foul mood because of several reasons. (1)The opening DJ playing was playing lounge-y music which made me really sleepy  (2) annoying 40-year-old virgins making out next to us all night long  (3) people were smoking everywhere  and (4) in front us  a guy with rave lights was doing rave moves with his hands.  I wouldn't have minded the rave lights IF it was in tune to the music.  Unfortunately  the guy thought he was so cool and was doing it till we left.   We left 30 minutes after Tiesto came out.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Been here a number of times and went this time for the Motley Crue residency.  Awesome show with crazy pyro.  The venue and seating were well above average  the cocktails were fine  and the security and organization to keep things moving were fine.  You can't expect perfection at a concert because people are people and lots of people always creates some issues.  Either way  always love seeing concerts here.  Staying in the hotel makes it even more convenient.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"This place has some of the best sound for a concert that I've ever had the pleasure of hearing.  Fun fact: I used to work for the circus (insert all the bearded lady jokes here) and I've been to many  many venues across the country as a result of it.  I don't throw ""best sound"" around lightly - for me a concert means nothing if the equipment is not up to par.  My most recent venture here was for The Pixies  which was a good show.  More for checking off my bucket list than anything  but the audio was superb.  Drinks are a bit pricy  but come on - do you expect $2 PBRs at one of the most well-known places for rock and roll in the world?  No.  Get your bad beer outta here and just be absorbed in the rad music  likeminded crowd  and overall well-fitting ambience of The Joint.  I wish ALL bands that I like played here.  Unfortunately  that's just not the case - sometimes I have to settle for House of Blues at Mandalay Bay (ick)."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Berlin  Brett Michaels  Cheap Trick - free concert! 80's rock party! Bang your head!  I was at the Joint last night to attend a free concert courtesy of the Infocomm Show - big props to VER  JBL  and Panasonic! Three bands that sounded great and put on a terrific show. With each playing for an hour or so this was like watching a greatest hits of 80's rock anthems. Berlin surprised me the most at how good they were and Terri Nunn's voice was amazing. Brett is Brett - the eternal rock and roller and his set was full of energy and terrific songs. He just loves performing in front of a crowd. Cheap Trick brought the house down with a consummate set of songs such as Dream Police  I Want You To Want Me  Surrender  and so many other hits that they had over the years. Rick Neilson is still one of the best guitarists of his era.  I was pretty impressed at the sound and acoustics here  considering the whole place is one big concrete floor room. The front of house guy nailed it  as each band sounded crystal clear  and the vocals were easily heard. The Joint is basically one big huge room with a concrete floor that angles down as you get closer to the upraised stage  so there are terrific sight lines no matter if you are in the front or standing in the back. There are actually three levels with the upper ones having seats and VIP booths. The main floor has a large pit area and then railed tiered levels as you head to the back. I tried a few different spots and all were a good view and sound. They also have some pretty cool lighting and effects over the stage and along the side walls.  There is a big bar on the bottom level that runs the length of the back area. Lots of bartenders and cocktail waitresses coming around for drinks. Easy access in and out of the place and pretty big bathrooms which is always a plus. I also had to notice the terrific air conditioning here. Even though it was crowded it was not at all hot and sweaty as many venues get. They also keep this place clean  as between each act a crew of people came around and picked up all the trash and mopped up any spills. Wow. Impressive.  Would I come back here to see a concert? In a heartbeat! This is a great venue and it's so cool to walk out into the Hard Rock and gamble to even more great music.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"my friends and i came here to see my favorite dj TiESTO this past Saturday [March 5th].  we arrived around 11:3OPM and there was NO LiNE!  i lovedd it!  will call was quick and easy; we were in and out with our tickets in less than 5 minutes.     the venue is huge  with a ton of room to move around in.  there are sections toward the front that are separated by metal railings  and most of the sections have tables and couches for people getting bottle service.  event was sold out  but it wasn`t sardine-can-packed  a fact which i loved.  i`ve been going to raves since i was 16  so as far as i`m concerned  i`m a full-fledged veteran.  most massives are packed to the ceiling and it feels like you`re the last of the toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube when you try to walk around.  The Joint was packed  but there was still ample space to move around without rubbing tits with everyone you pass LoLx  plus i loved the fact that since we were in Vegas it was 21+  whereas most raves are either 18+ or all ages.  it was definitely a lot cleaner and classier! :D  i don`t think i`ll ever enjoy another massive rave again!       there`s a long bar in the back  as well as one to the side of the stage.  drinks are ""Vegas priced "" $21 for an Long Island [for me] and a Corona [for booboo].  we also paid $48 for 3 shots of Patron.  it is VEGAS after all  so i wasn`t complaining.  WATER  on the other hand  was $15 a bottle!  now that`s excessive when water cost more than alcohol. o.O;;  there is  however  a solution to that problem.  you`re allowed to bring drinks into the venue as long as they`re not in glassware.  the security will supply you with a plastic cup when you reach the front  and all you do is transfer your drink over and walk in!  so what you do is buy a bottle of water from the bar outside next to the entrance of The Joint for $5  then bring it in with you!  you end up paying a 3rd of the price and get to bring it in with you!  everyone wins!  LoLx ;]  Tiesto KiLLED iT when he came on!  the music was phenomenal  the vibe was great  and i had awesomee friends to share the experience with!!  i`m definitely coming back in a few months to see Tiesto spin again at The Joint!!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The Joint venue at the Hard Rock- An embarrassing security with no professionalism  abusing their power ruining an experience for me and undoubtedly many others. I had gone to a music event (a rave) to see excision and had to use the restroom so I went to the bathroom within the venue which was already incredibly packed and waited for an open place to take a leak and when I was in the stall that had opened up I checked my pockets to ensure I had all my items (phone  cash  ID  etc). Now leaving the stall a security guard waited for me and another person and took our IDs and pulled us to the back while not even telling us what we did wrong until we were pulled in the back and we were questioned what we were doing and tried to make us say we were rolling a blunt when I had nothing on me and did nothing wrong. I had been in the stall for maybe 1-1 1/2 minutes so I don't see how it would be remotely possible for me to do anything besides pee. The security did not search the stall which I still had not flushed (even though I tried to). I had no idea he was there so I would have had no way of knowing to hide something and he saw my hands empty when I came out. I had been complaint and had already emptied my pockets and was ready to get patted down but instead was given an ultimatum to either say I was doing something I wasn't just so I could possibly be let back in to see the show or we'd be kicked out. I was not searched at all and there was no tangible evidence that I was doing something wrong. So based on suspicion of doing something  me and another individual were forced to sign a paper that we were banned with no refund and we were not given the chance to talk to any supervisor and instead were met with the same guy and was threatened to be handcuffed for being on the property. There was no process in the matter and we were told just told ""I told like your attitude so you are banned for suspicion of narcotics"". We did not want to basically kneel to these people when we had done nothing wrong and because we didn't I was robbed of the money i paid for the event  robbed of my time  and the last great night to have with my other friends that were still in the venue. The man that had banned us and showed up when we asked for the supervisor was named Dustin. Do not do business with people that won't give you due process. I'm sure it's happened to others too and they need to be exposed."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great small venue. We sat balcony seating at the Journey concert.  Bar staff was very attentive and we had a great view of the stage  I can't think of any issues  but that could have been because of all the drinks both there and at the bar right outside where we watched Cyanide afterwards.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw Russell Peters on May 30. The venue was nice: I sat in the back of the ground floor and still had a pretty decent view of the stage. There really isn't a bad place to sit.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Besides being crammed up to your neighbor in uncomfortable seats  this place is great.  Pretty small venue  reminds me of the Aerial/Verizon theater in Houston.  Saw Willie Nelson on friday nite and he was AWESOME!  (he was walking around the casino  missed that!)  We were on the second tier and could see him pretty good.  Would love to see a rock band without seating!  Could easily get up close to see them.  Minus one star for not having cheap drinks.  But what do I expect  it's VEGAS!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I loved this place. I was in Vegas a few weeks ago and the day before I saw in one of the magazines Deftones would be in town for a show. I thought fuck yeah I have not seen them since like 97 or 98  Gotta check this.  I knew it would be so worth it to go here.  This was one of the best shows I have ever been to  and it was cheaper than if I would've gone to this tour in NJ or NY for that matter.  I got my ticket one hour before showtime at the box office and with the ticket master fee it was $37.00.  I know for a fact in NY this would've been at 50 bucksor at least $70.00 to get in.   The venue was really nice- not huge but a nice size. I got there really early so I guided myself by the front. The playlist Deftones chose was excellent too. Back to School is one of my favorite songs  and of course Minerva.  I was surprised the didn't play Whole in the Earth though  but its ok...  La Butcherette  Dillinger Escape Plan were the opening acts.  Chino did a great job live  the crowd was really into it.  There were some hotties in the crowd too so that was cool. I got up close and personal with some cute nerdy latina.  She was a local vegas chick there.  The Pit was kinda to my right and at least I didn't have to duck punches or anything but yeah the crowd did get tossed to the left and right sometimes.  I would come back to this venue in the future.  I didn't get any drinks at the bar so I am not sure about the prices and all that. I wasn't in the mood for overpaying for beer.   http://youtu.be/wp8Xw-wsaNQ  Deftones in concert  playing Back to School.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Just saw my first show at The Joint and I enjoyed it.  I like the size of it... big enough to have a big crowd  but small enough so you can see from everywhere.  It kind of reminded me of seeing a show at a House of Blues.  I had ponied up for tickets about ten rows back from the stage  so we could see Motley Crue great.  This particular show included probably the most pyrotechnics I have ever seen at a concert  and that includes the 80s arena shows I used to go to!  It was pretty awesome.  The sound was good... like most shows the music seems to drown out the vocals a bit  but not a big deal.  It was fast and easy to get inside and there were a ton of ushers to help get you to the right seats.  Every employee I encountered was friendly.  They had plenty of drink lines so it was easy to grab a beer and the bathrooms are inside so quick to run to when you need to and then get back to your seat!    Looks like they do a lot of standing concerts and then just set up seats in whatever configuration they want when doing a seated show.  Overall  I enjoyed it and would see another show here for sure.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Great venue for seeing a musical performance. General admission floor seating allows you to get as close as you want to the stage and just about every table has a perfect view. Acoustics were great   They do have screens on each side of the stage  but for the Prince show that I attended  they gladly didn't turn them on. Before the show  the screens were used for advertising and announcements. I thought it was ironic that a notice that any photography or video recording was prohibited followed an advertisement by a telecom provider asking people to ""text pics"" of the show to them on Twitter. Nonetheless  once the show started  security was tapping a lot of people on the shoulder for using their mobile phones to take photos."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great place to see a concert. We saw a private event at The Joint for Darius Rucker and Flo Rida (I know  weird). We were on the floor in the first row. It was a fun time. I'd definitely go back for another concert.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,So much fun!!  We saw Twenty One Pilots for the second time and it was so nice to be in such an intimate venue.  They always put on a great show but this time was even better as I could order drinks at the bar and find my spot up front with ease as they have the pit sectioned off with bars.  My kids had a wonderful time and we can't wait for our next concert there!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Blech.  Boo.  Hiss!  Going to a show at the Joint takes intestinal fortitude I usually don't have.  First of all  the Hard Rock likes to book big name bands in this mid-size venue so that ticket prices soar to up to $300+.  Maybe if John Lennon and George Harrison returned from the dead and the Beatles were going to play a one night only reunion engagement at the Joint  and they were miraculously changed from old  saggy men to young  spry musicians again would I spend $300 to see a show at the Joint.  MAYBE.  (And seriously  you've no idea how much I love the Beatles.)  Anyway  the acoustics are horrid.  Whoever designed the place was an acoustic idiot.  I hope with the money they got from it they took some classes to help them or something.  Getting IN the place is just ridiculous.  With no signage letting you know what shows you can or can't take purses into  I've waited in line and got to the front only to be turned around to the (inevitably crowded) coat check counter and then back to wait in line again.  The sight lines inside can be horrid if you end up pushed to a wrong spot and sometimes they decide just not to utilize the two HUGE screens to the side  which must suck for the shorties.  (Most shows are GA  standing room only.)  Sometimes a band I really want to see comes here  and then I'll brave it.  But they have to be someone I really  REALLY want to see.  And they  can't be taking pledges for my first born as part of the ticket price either.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,One of the best venues to see a concert in Las Vegas.  I love how it's not to big and has a more intimate feel for a concert goer.  I've seen multiple bands here and I've never been disappointed!  The staff is always friendly and on point.  It's located in the Hard Rock Casino so after the show you can go to the circle bar and grab a drink or hit the tables and gamble the night away.  They've made a lot of updates to the Hard Rock and there is great musical memorabilia located throughout so it's really cool to go check out all the new stuff since they keep changing it all the time.  When in Vegas check out the lineup for The Joint and if you want to see a great concert in a great venue check it out.  The Hard Rock is located just off the strip but a cab ride is only about $5 or you can even walk there.   Cheers!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I don't understand how a venue ""designed"" for music shows has such bad acoustics! The sound was really terrible and put a bit of a damper on the show.  Hmmm.... probably because the whole place is concrete?   I wouldn't go back here again unless I was really dying to see a band  but then I'd probably be sad because they sounded horrible.  On the plus side  the restrooms are easily accessible; and there were cocktail waitresses that came into the crowd and took orders.... but that's not what really counts when I want to hear good music."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I visited this place for the Santana concert and had a blast  this place is smaller and becasue of that even far away seats are still good seats.   We sat right in the front and was a great experience  place did not feel not over crowded even though it was a full venue and drink servers come by quick for refills.   I definately would come to venues at the Joint again.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,When I heard they were building a bigger newer Joint  I was quite skeptical. I thought  gone are those intimate awesome shows there! Well  I was partly right because the New Joint *is* bigger  but it's a good thing. I expected to see bolted down seating as in a theatre  but instead saw comfortable fold-up chairs (removable ;) Yay!) Sometimes the standing shows are so much better depending upon who you're seeing.   The New Joint is bigger  but also elegant and classier than the old one. The staff is friendly too  which is always important to me.   Even though I had seats pretty far back during Flight of the Conchords  it was still a great time and I wasn't lamenting the fact that I wasn't right up in their faces like I am for most shows I go to. ;) I could still see pretty well  so the size isn't too big that you won't enjoy everything.  Also  there is more extensive seating upstairs now than in the older Joint. This upstairs area goes all the way around.   I'll definitely be looking forward to seeing another show there  hopefully in the near future!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Standing room on the side balconies was waaaaaay over packed. We paid big bucks to see Muse and could barely see them at times. They really over sold this show.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is a great live venue. I saw Guns N Roses as well as Def Leppard here recently and was very pleased with the acoustics of this venue as well as the quality of the production. The lighting and sound are amazing and it really gives House of Blues a run for it's money!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,My favorite concert experience hands down. Not just because i was 2 arm lengths away from my favorite country artist  but because of the overall feel of the venue. It's intimate  there's not a bad seat in the house. The music was not blaring too loud  and the crowd was pushing and shoving down at the stage (maybe this changes with the artist!)  I think the artists also feel a little more connected with their fans here and actually have fun  not just putting on a show.  We didn't order drinks (paid $14 for a beer enough times before getting there  we were done!) but it is a huge bar in the back and the staff seemed nice.   It was weird lining up for the doors to open though.... Lots of opportunity for jerks to Rambo their way in front of others in line. More staff presence would've been helpful.  We'll return for another concert there for sure!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Vegas isn't the best town to see bands in. mainly becuase  if its not mainstream radio  odds are we are ignored. but when a band does come  odds are it is to the Joint. I have seen many shows here  Muse  Interpol  Death Cab for Cutie  Vampire Weekend  Snow Patrol  The Beastie Boys  Wolfmother  and I could go on. Whats great is that you can always get down close to the band  without really having to push your way through people  which i wont do  but many people do anyways. This is becuase of the 3 leveled floors. But the common theme of almost all shows ive seen here has been dicks. i have seen a number of fights (at fairly peaceful bands)  People are always smoking  spilling drinks  and having no regard for those around them. but thats vegas people  not the joint. so i cant knock it down for that. But the venue is clean  rarely sells out (once again  vegas music scene  not the joint)  and lets you get close to really good bands.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The old Joint was intimate in my opinion and i was sadden to see it go.  I've seen greats like the Foo FIghters  and Tom Petty there and recently saw the Blink 182 reunion in the new Joint.    I must say they have done a great job renovating this place.  It's large enough to feel like a big concert hall but small enough to have a great view from anywhere in the place.  the Hard Rock Hotel is packed enough as it is but entrance into the venue was easy and not too crowded.  I particularly didn't like the merch table set up since there was only one and it was situated right next to the main entrance and the line to get in.  This made it a little confusing when lining up to figure out what line you were in  the merch line or the entrance line.    All and all if you're in Vegas or want to get away to a concert outside of the LA area The new Joint is a nice place to consider.    P.S.  The bar in the Joint pours some strong mixed drinks.  NICE!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I saw Guns and Roses here and damn even at age 50 Axl still has it. The venue is cool b/c it's small so no matter where you sit the seats are decent. I like how open the space is - you can get a drink and still see the stage. The sound on the lower level was great. But I dislike that smoking is allowed in the venue. I know it's Vegas but come on  why does everyone have to inhale other people's smoke. They should at least use proper ventilation or make the smokers go into a separate area.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,If you find someone playing here that you want to see: fret not my friend  this venue has your back. Acoustically the venue performs  and you're sure to find a spot to see the show that you'll enjoy.   I've been for 2 concerts: Kenny Chesney and Chris Stapleton. Concerts are a personal choice  so I'll save the review and just say that the both were superb acts and I would see both again.   General admission: Both times I went were general admission/standing room only. The floor is inclined  providing benefit to people in the back. Yay! I think it depends on the concert  but they have chairs setup near the rear of the floor. I wouldn't suggest this as it would provide difficulty to see the stage.   The general admission floor is definitely friendly to people in wheelchairs  as they can go pretty much anywhere. The only problem is the relative height to people standing in front of them.   The balconies: There are two balconies  which have limited table seating. The balcony of course gives you a birds eye view of the performance. Everyone on the balcony was standing and leaning over the railing to watch the show  so don't expect to get a view from the table seating.   The bar: there is a large bar at the back of the GA floor that has several bartenders. The lines can get long 15+ people)  but they do the best they can to keep up with the crowds.   The restrooms: there's a men's restroom at one end of the bat and a women's restroom at the other end of the bar. Each time I went to use the ladies room there wasn't a line (yippee). I'm sure there's lines sometimes  but overall good stall capacity in my experience.   The stage: it had different configurations for both of the concerts I attended: a typical stage setup and a tee setup  allowing the artist to interact a bit more with the audience. I'm sure this is performer preferred setup  so the Venue gets points for flexibility on stage setup.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This venue is pretty nice. There are 3 floors  the speakers are great  and from every place  you can still see the stage. We paid for the open bar tickets which were about 40 bucks cheaper than the floor  There still plenty of room to move and there are chairs  plus OPEN BAR. No brainer. Went here for Tiesto. There were two djs before him that did a great job  then he played a 4 hours set. Im gonna say hes much better in person  than his Vegas Cd  so if you got that and like it  you should see him live  much better. Anyways  get the open bar  and go back every 10 minutes  cuz they'll jack the prices up crazy after open bar closes. A water bottle was 15 dollars. Tip the bar tenders  they kept the drinks strong. Good time.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,There really isn't much to dislike about the Joint at The Hard Rock Hotel. The sight lines are good from any place in the venue. I should note that I've only ever had floor tickets to the shows I've seen here. As with any venue on the Strip  I'd suggest you pre game slightly off-premises and walk over because drink prices are predictably high  but that is what it is. I'm here for the music  and the shows here are always great. Parking is usually easy  especially since we're not let off on Las Vegas Blvd. Recommended  venue.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Came here last night to see Soundgarden.  This was actually my first time in the Hard Rock Hotel!  I loved the ambiance!  After you make your way through the casino  The Joint  is in the back.  Easy to get to  security was nice  and it was easy in and out.  We had general admission on the floor and there was plenty of room.  I always get super hot at concerts and this one I felt really comfortable without getting too warm at all.  Major points for good climate control!  I don't think you can get a bad ""seat"" or standing position in the place.  The bar had lines but they went reasonably fast and the bartenders made good drinks.  I would definitely come back to see another concert!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,My husband and I saw Marilyn Manson and The Smashing Pumpkins there last July and had a blast!  At first I was a little worried when I saw the line to get in  but it moved quickly and we walked in just as Marilyn got on stage.  I got worried again when I saw the long drink lines  but found that these lines were only long at the beginning of the show.   Most of The Joint is general admission  which is great....there were lots of different spots with a good view of the show and there was easy access to the aisles so we could move around or head back to the bar.  The front area is the pit which got crowded right in front of the stage  but was big enough to watch the show from comfortably a little further back. They also had a cocktail waitress in the pit who got us drinks pretty quickly.  The general admission was great....seating was further back and didn't seem like it would be much fun to be way in back or on the edges. Anyway  it was a great venue and I would definitely go back!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great acoustics  excellent crowd control  easy to get in and out  free parking - probably everything you could ask for in a venue that holds ~3 000-4 000.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I can't believe I haven't reviewed The Joint yet. Not my favorite concert venue in town  but it's good enough. I thought old The Joint was fine  but I suppose they wanted to fit more concert goers in and make more money. We've experienced seats  standing on the floor general admission  and this last concert we attended were stuck up on the 3rd level balcony which was also standing general admission. It was nice being away from the crowds but the view and sound wasn't as good as lower levels. The bartenders were quick  so we never had to wait in line long. The bathrooms are really close too which makes for a quick pit stop while a not so favorite song is playing. Even though there was a security guard right by the men's room the smell of weed was over powering every time the door was open  so if you're sensitive to it  stand in a different area. Drink prices are still high  typical for Las Vegas concert venues.  The crowd can be rowdy and drunk  sometimes I wonder why they go to a concert at all  talking or texting the whole show. We already have tickets for a concert in February  so of course we will continue to visit this venue.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I absolutely love this place! I was there this weekend for Motley Crue and I am not disappointed. We had a table on the 3rd fl  and the view was amazing. Even though this place is big it seems like no matter where you are you get a good view. Service was great  the show was great  the venue was great. I would absolutely see a show there again.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Love this venue! The openness and laid back atmosphere really allows you to enjoy any show.  Definitely will be looking to see more shows here
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Nice venue for the Prince show last night  but he only played for an hour and ten minutes! Now I know this is a review of the Joint  but until the venues start holding the artist accountable  we will be getting ripped off.  The General Admission tix were about $230 for the both of us. That's pretty expensive for a seventy minute show.  Make these artists sign a contract that they will play for a certain amount of time and let the consumer know how long. That way we can decide whether we want to pony up the money to see it. I am so mad I want my money back. A seventy minute show  REALLY?
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is the way concerts are meant to be seen. I can see why The Joint was named one of the top 25 music venues in the U.S. by Billboard Magazine. The chairs are comfortable and roomy and every part of the venue offers a decent view of the stage. It's kind of like a combination of a theatre and an arena. It's got theatre comfort and intimacy with the excitement and adrenaline of a traditional sports venue. The balcony seats are superior to what you'll find on the floor. The floor seats appear to be just fold-out chairs. But usually people on the floor stand up for the whole show anyway so it probably doesn't make much difference.  The process of getting in the venue is surprisingly orderly and organized. When you walk in the front door the staff direct you which line to go in to get to your section the fastest. Unlike in an arena where everyone gets through the door and is immediately smushed together and fighting to make it through.  I wouldn't recommend ordering a drink here as the booze is expensive but there's got to be a trade-off for comfy seats  great sound  orderly process  and a great view.  I look forward to my next concert at The Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to the New Edition/ Babyface concert and we had a suite..best service ever and the drinks were perfect everytime!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I was at the Joint just the other night and had a great time. Rolling Stone was having a little party up stairs in the balcony during a sold out show  which afforded us a great view  free drinks and room to move. It looked pretty packed downstairs and there were not that many bars  but the casino is litter ally 10 steps from the front door. One complaint would be the 20 huge TV screens in there. It was distracting...
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Considering the venue was Tiesto  which I am a huge fan of . I had a great time. The stage and lights looked amazing and Tiesto topped it off with great music. If you were on the floor you will be able to feel the music vibrate through you  that's how good the sound is. I was on the floor and it never felt like it got too crowded  but maybe that is because I have been to much more crowded events like EDC and TAO. But I thought the floor had a decent amount of space. I wish they had seats or something though because jumping around for 3-4 hours can get tiring. Another complaint can be the $15 dollar charge for water  I was prepared because I read other yelp reviews  but that doesn't change the fact that water is pretty ridiculously priced. Overall those were the only downsides and the upsides completely overshadowed the negatives.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Tiesto being my favorite DJ ever  I was really hyped and eager to celebrate my birthday with my friends watching him on Feb. 5th.    Tiesto as ALWAYS was amazing! the music  the visuals  his energy  and the other entertainment was awesome.  If i was reviewing him it would be 5 stars but I'm reviewing the Joint.....   We got there early  before the crowd got too big and appreciated the intimidate feeling about the small venue  the security was friendly and helpful and the place was nice.   As it got closer to Tiestos' start time and the crowd got bigger and bigger; my friends and I were pushed and shoved by people trying to steal our place in front of the stage.  I think that the VIP tables in the middle of the floor take way too much space which is why it was unbearable to stay down there for too long.  We ended up moving all the way to the back behind the VIP section so we could have some space to dance.  The drink prices were ridiculous  water was $15 and a Moster N vodka was $20 !!!!!! It's insane! So needless to say I was completely sober and out of cash by 1 am :(  I will most likely not go to any other event at the Joint because of the above.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This was a pretty good venue for the recent concert I went to. There was a lot of space and different areas for various concert goers. Up front where more of the mosh pit and dancing was  the back for idly standing  and the upstairs premium area where you paid to be able to sit and have tables.  There was a big bar area in the back that was serving super expensive alcohol and beer.  For how big the venue was and for how many people it can hold  the tempurature was always cool and comfortable.  The only downside was safety and security. When one of the better known acts started playing  a lot of the fans pushed towards the front of the stage and someone got mobbed and almost trampled  and had to have help walking off to safety. It took almost an hour for security to get people to move back and away from the stage so maintenance and other security could fix the front row of barricades.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I was in Vegas a couple weeks ago to hang out and just relax. Upon rolling up to the Hardrock where we were staying a friend and I both saw the Marquee with DEFTONES written all over it. Within a matter of seconds I knew we'd be making it to the Deftones concert that weekend for sure.  Tickets were really expensive at the box office. 2 friends bought them for full price $60 something and we luckily scored two for $20 from some guy that had extras.   Let me tell you  I've gone to my fair share of concerts back in the day from Korn  Powerman5000  Papa Roach to Ozzy and Warped Tour. I've seen plenty of venues around the U.S. and think the Joint is one of the best. The floor is big and spacious. The arena is tiered so there is not a bad seat or standing room in this place. There are 3 big screens surrounding the stage and the acoustics were bomb. Seriously one of the best concerts I have ever been to and the venue made it that much better.  I'm coming back to see Incubus in October and I can't wait.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,decent place not to mobbed  good if theres a great band to see!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Nice  big concert venue located inside Hard Rock Hotel. Saw Swedish House Mafia DJ here on Halloween night and they were off the hook! Ive seen better production though. 3 complaints about the venue:   1) If you didnt get bottle service there is no place to sit (ladies  heed my warning before you go out and wear those heels). We luckily found a spot right in front of the bar and used the room divider as a spot to sit and a place to rest our drinks and coats on.  2) Two bathrooms: One upstairs in VIP  and one downstairs. The one downstairs didnt have any lights above the sinks/mirrors.  Is this place designed and maintained by men?  3) VIP area floor was covered with spilled drinks and no one cleaning it. I probably slipped twice (but luckily didnt make it to the ground). Potential lawsuit?  I'll come again if the act is worth seeing.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The Joint is a relatively intimate venue considering what bands usually play here. I've only been here for a GA show (opening night for the Kings of Leon tour) but I can say that I would definitely come back. The acoustics are great. If you get to the venue early enough  you'll get a good spot right near the stage. We were rolling 3 deep off the rail and it was sweet. Of course  you get your share of d-bags (you are in Vegas  no escaping it)  but security seemed to do their jobs without being dickheads.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Fuck Ticketmaster  if you are in Vegas stop off at the Joint's box office. You won't have to pay any ridiculous surcharges  you'll have the ability to choose your seat and you'll most likely get a better seat then you would online. However it's not really money saved as you will end up spending the difference on a drink here. I went to the Joint for a Strikeforce event and had seats a few rows away from the front of the balcony. The striking from the octagon permeated throughout the arena and the sound quality was on point. I wasn't sure what to expect with the layout  but the venue seems optimized for any event. I wouldn't hesitate to get tickets for any future concerts next time I'm in Vegas.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Loved this place! Pricey but worth every penny! 3 levels of party is outrageous and the lines for the bathroom ain't long at all!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to the NEW JOINT at Hard Rock for the Media/Soft Opening.  Complimentary food and drinks kept coming.  The free picture setup was cool too--there were props and costume stuff available so that you can take a rockstar pick with a photoshopped background of your choosing.    The venue was pretty nice.  It has double the capacity (4000+) of the old Joint.  The sound system seemed up to par.  I took the escalator to the top floor and worked my way down.  Just like the old Joint there is not a bad seat in the house  even the last row seats.    I walked down to the 2nd floor where they have their 7 VIP suites.  Some suites were bigger than others  but all had the typical suite amenities with more room  food bar  tables  and couches along with (p)leather stadium seating.  The seats didn't rock though which would have been nice.  I thought they had good support although one friend said that they were too hard.  The first floor was just like the old Joint's all standing area.  There is an area right in front of the stage that can either be for a huge mosh pit or for tables.  There are a few hip high railed sections in back of the open area. I noticed the unfinished concrete floors.  I think this was by design for liability purposes since crowds + drinking = wet floors = slip//falls.   If I remember correctly  the old Joint had wooden floors.  (Sorry  my lawyer brain is usually always on.)  As expected  all floors have bars in the back of the venue.  The 2nd floor also have tall bar tables along the side as well.  I can't wait to see a concert there.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Venue was cool but no seats!! However for not having any seats  it was roomie for all concert lovers:) the best part  is we stood there  and the venue let's you go in and out with a ticket and also allows you to come inaide with a plastic cup. So instead of buying a drink  I'd go back to my room make two drinks and head back to show during band change:-) very cool!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Trailer Park Boys did not disappoint!   We went to the Sunday show and enjoyed the venue even standing behind general seating. They opened the doors an hour early and got us in quickly with a friendly smile. The bartenders were fast with the drinks (yes they are a little on the pricey side  but that is to be expected)   We laughed until tears rolled down our faces  and Ricky even made his way past the stage and up to the bar so we were able to get up close to one of the Stars of this epic Canadian mockumentary. We had a great time.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came here to see Stone Sour  douchehole Papa Roach fans ruined it. $14 water  $12 beers. Place kinda smells like a fart  no joke. Luckily the drunk lady in front of me had strong perfume on. Ok acoustics. Just reminded me of why I don't see rock shows in Vegas I guess.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue for rock concerts  but avoid sitting on the top balcony.  The views are obstructed so move over to the SRO area for better views.  Drinks are pricey  $12 a beer so be prepared for sticker shock.  Waitresses can have a bit of an attitude and really not sure why  but still a great place to watch concerts.  Worthwhile to fly in from LA and make a weekend out of it.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,One of my favorite venues in Las Vegas; love the small size and great seats. I usually go for the general standing room area for a full and sometimes interactive experience. The only (and most important) thing is that the sound system seems either outdated or just not rich enough especially for some of the amazing acts that play there. Still  being on of only three small venues with major acts  it is perfect for concerts. Of course  there is no shortage of good places to eat before or after events  making it a complete evening.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw KISS at The Joint and this is just a really great venue. The space is perfect for a band like this. I also saw Def Lepard here and the closeness to the stage is incredible with just amazing sound  not to mention the artists themselves. When I first got there the line to get in was incredibly long and my wife and I thought there would be no way we would get in on time. Well they moved that line faster than any other place I have ever been to. Once in The Joint there are several bars and the space is large so you don't feel crunched before the show. After the rest concert  the exit was just as easy as the entry. Well done Joint. You have gotten these residencies down!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Out of all the venues in vegas  this one by far is intimate compared to the rest.   The only issue I have with this is the ""Type'"" of venue. Mostly it is a standing room only.  Wear some comfy shoes!   Other than that  overall its a good venue to see a concert at."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came to see KISS during their residency at The Joint.  We purchased and printed tickets at home so didn't have to go to the Box office.  On concert day  we went to the conference door area and were directed to a specific line according to wear our seats were.  Doors open at 7 and show at 8  and we went in around 7:20.  The next staff person checked my purse by opening each zipper and looking quickly inside.  We had checked in a bag at the concierge as they aren't allowed in.   The lines moved quickly and there are lots of staff telling you where to go.    We went inside and up the escalator to the balcony.  The walkways are wide so it's not crowded and cramped.  The men's washroom is by the top of the escalator and the women's is closer to the seats.  There was a cart of two of people selling beer and drinks along the way.  Women's washroom big and clean  so good with no line ups before show time.  Our tickets were for the third row (CC) from front balcony.  There wasn't anyone there to help us find our seats and I wasn't sure of the section but found a sign by the seating.  It was a good view of the stage.  Higher the catwalk might block part of the stage but no issues for us.  Great sound and music  but also the pyrotechnics with lights  and bangs were cools.  There were 2 large screens on each side of the stage which offered closeups of Gene's tongue and Paul shaking his bum.  Great stage set up and Eric played his drums high up from the stage too.  As with any concert  crowded going down the stairs after the show but once in the lobby  it wasn't bad.  Would definitely come see a show here again.  Not sure how comfortable it is in the lower bowl as the fold up seats seemed close together.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I have seen 4 or 5 shows at this venue so far  and it has fast become my favorite place to see a show in Las Vegas  now that I've discovered that you can buy a VIP ""skybox"" seat. Before that  it was your average 4 000 seat sweatbox  with a haphazard staff  but a large stage with great production. I liked that there were large  efficient bars  so you can wet your whistle during any given show  and it probably would have warranted a solid 3-star review. But for Motley Crue  I noticed that you could spend a little extra for a VIP box  and man was that a whole different experience. First off  you get what is essentially a sky-box  that is accessed via a special  private floor  completely separate from the general admission madness. each box seats only 10 people  so you can either buy a couple of seats in that box and have only a small handful of neighbors  or get some friends together to buy the box out for a completely private concert experience. In addition to the 10 seats in the front of the box  there are also lounge-style stools  and even some sofas  for chilling between sets. Finally  there are servers there to take your order  so you don't have to go to the bar  the bar comes to you. This has become my absolute favorite way to to see a show  as my patience for the general public wears thinner and thinner with each passing year. It costs more  but you definitely get what you pay for in this instance."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I went to a rock concert at the joint yesterday and I was surprised by the venue. It is mainly a small standing room only facility. The sitting area is above the stage on the perimeter. It was an intimate feeling yet  a dirty mess. Everyone was drinking during the show and spilled their beer on the floor! Cups  booze  and lemons were everywhere making it a slippery sticky situation. With that being said  I had an amazing time and enjoyed the show. However  this would have been dangerous for children.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I thought the security people were kind of ridiculous here.  I queued all day for a GA show here along with like 100 other people.  However  when they decided to let us into the venue  instead of trying to handle the line in an orderly fashion  they just let everyone loose like rabid dogs.  They had several doors open for ticket scanning and I got stuck in a slow line.  The woman scanning our tickets decided to stop to yell at people for pushing  so I basically got screwed and people behind me got ahead of me for the show.  Ahh  I was so pissed!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Saw disturbed here and the acoustics were horrid. It was loud as hell and the instruments sounded ok but the singers voice just sounded like he had a cloth stuffed in his mouth. Really surprised at how bad that concert sounded.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This review is for the Suites at The Joint  I have been the The Joint venue twice for shows  and love the size  sound and general layout of the venue; large  yet intimate. We booked tickets to see Motley Crue in the Suites and loved it.  The suites are small rooms  on the second floor. There are washrooms and a bar just outside the door  and across the hallway. We had a waitress serving us before and during the show. The suites are FIRST COME FIRST SERVE for seating! Very important detail! There are two rows of 5 very comfy chairs along the front  and a bar with 4 bar stools over looking the two rows. There is a couch in the back facing a large flat screen TV with a live feed of the show. We arrived early and scooped a couple chairs in the front  and when a group of 5 older drunk guys showed up they were out of luck  and left. Ha. More room for us!  The sight lines are amazing  the chairs great and the easy access to the bar and bathrooms made this a winner.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I ""attempted"" to go to an event (knife party) on May 28th  2016. I bought my ticket at the PO box on the same day  I waited in line where all the other girls where waiting at  it was my turn to give my ID and the gentleman was looking very hard at it  then said he had to give it to his buddy to take a look at it  I've told them this picture is a couple years old and I dyed my hair  not only that but I've gained a couple of pounds. He would not believe me  said that it wasn't me and to let ""Elena"" know to come pick up her ID at the lost and found  then turned around and continued with the next person. I could NOT believe it  I was very upset that this was really happening. My boyfriend came over to give me my Debit card that matched with My ID and my boyfriend attempted to talk to the bouncer  and he said  "" I'm not talking to you about it  if she wants to talk  she needs to talk to me"" So I went over and showed the bouncer my debit card and that it matched my ID! and he will STILL not accept it  I asked if I can show him an old picture on my Facebook account  he agreed  and I kept on trying to explain that my ID picture I have no makeup and I was younger  so OBVIOUSLY it's going to look different  I couldn't convince this bouncer  I talked to numerous people and a supervisor  which all she did was feel my hands and look at my arms.. very weird because she only did this with me  she said I was hot and it was unacceptable and scribbled all over my ticket  and said I wasn't allowed to go in. I waited 5 hours for metro to verify that it is me  when the event was over  security was walking around asking everyone to leave the premises  me and my boyfriend stayed there  a security manager asked us what we where doing  we explained the situation  and she asked for my name  said she was going to look for my ID  she came back and said it wasn't me.. I was so upset  I had to look for an old Facebook picture and I showed her that THIS WAS ME AND THAT THIS WAS MY ID.. I was able to convince her with an old picture  I am just very disappointed that I wasted my time and money and received no apologies  I felt harassed and token advantage of  I understand the tickets are non refundable  but something like this  I am entitled to a refund. If you are coming to an event here  please make sure they don't try and do this to you. thank you for everyone that read this!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Just saw Cindy Lauper there and it was handled so badly... waste of money. Management didn't handle problems such as intoxicated loud patrons that ruined the show for those around them.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,First time here and I really liked this venue. It's big enough to have room to move  plenty of great locations for viewing the show  and enough irons to put you as close  or as far  from the entertainment as you'd like. The bar service was quick and staff was friendly.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,i was impressed with the Joint. My first time at this venue was to see a PaRaMoRe concert. I really like the layout. I'm very short and have always had issues at concerts when it came to getting a great view. But that wasn't the issue. It's large enough to hold a good crowd of people but small enough for the concert to be more on the intimate side.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The Joint is small and intimate. Flirty guards and ushers  cute bartenders who wink. Upstairs has an nice view of the stage  but really seem too high up  unlike a house of blues.   For two nights  I saw the same band  Duran Duran  at two different locations at the Joint. First night I was in the front  but its very hard to see with size 20s fat Duranies allover the places pushing around as if it's a Korn mosh pit. So I went to the back. That's a good spot because it gives a good view of the screen  (unless a Duranie heffer blocks it.)  The second night I found out why it seems as though the front row is 2 inches taller than everyone. Basically  they put up a barricade that has a base ontop of the floor  which rises the first two row of people about 2 inches. So anyone behind them can't see. Luckily  I held my ground in a sea of Duranie hephers a few rows back pushing  and was on that barricade! I was infront of a speaker that had the bass up way too loud.   Both nights  I can agree that the acoustics need work. The sound could be better.   After the show  you can only get out one door  so that's kind of like mooooving the herd. Then I got herded into Body English  the Joint's little sistah night club.   The next night I remember to avoid the mad rush into Body English.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,compared to Jillian's-We'll miss you!:(- and House of blues  this place is a freaking mansion! its so big and i went there for the As I Lay Dying concert (which was AMAZING!!). two complaints: really overpriced soda where you dont even get the whole can  but a stinking small cup for $5  and the layout is really confusing especially if the place is filled and people are moshing.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I haven't been here in years- before they remodeled the Joint  so it was nice seeing the changes. We saw Prince at the 8pm show on Saturday. Excellent show  no opening act  and started maybe 15 min late. I think it was around an hour and 20 min  with a 15-20 min encore.   I enjoyed it because it was a small venue  so you could see him pretty well. Our tickets were ""best available"" for $95. I knew that meant standing room only on the floor  but I thought there might be a designation for ticket price- (ie  the expensive tickets got to stand closer). That wasn't the case- you just went down to the floor and stood where ever. So  I might have been better off buying the cheaper seats.  The sound quality and stage effects were great  and of course Prince was amazing!"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I was in front part of 2nd balcony  but there really are no bad seats here.   Journey sounded and looked great. Amazing vocals  guitar  keyboard and drums.   The audience was into the concert  but not like when I saw Meatloaf here in Vegas last year.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"You can take the Girl out of the '80s but you can't take the ""Rocker"" out of the girl!    We were in Vegas last weekend for our daughter's soccer tournament and guess who  was in town playing at the Joint? Def Leppard!  Had to go for lots of reason!  Yes  they still have the one-armed-drummer and can still sing.    This was my second time seeing a concert at the Joint and I have to say.....it is a great venue.  There was seating everywhere which was fabulous - not fighting for space or elbowing your way to keep your spot is pretty nice.  Have to say  it was tight but it was nice to have a place to lay my bag that was not the floor.    It was easy getting in and getting out  the concert started on time and the bathroom lines were fast (always a good thing when you are a girl)"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Attended the Scorpions concert May 20 2016 and it was a great show. The only thing that was disappointing were all the drunks wanting to crowd the aisles and block the view of the band. It seemed that the only place to see clearly was to buy tickets in the balcony. Plenty of security  but useless to see unless you stood up.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"This venue is ok. Nothing much to really say. But here's what i've got.  I saw Linkin Park here  I had a great time as i'm a big fan of LP. Bought a couple shirts and a wrist band here  Also Coheed and Cambria was opening along with 2 other bands  and got some merchandise of Coheed and Cambria.  Service was ""fast"" but not really friendly  while i was buying merch  the guy who helped me didn't even talk to me  other than saying the price and my total. It was fine i got my stuff  but it sure turns my head the other way. I like to talk to people at special events and concerts and it seems to me the guy looked angry aha.  Anyways  the show was good  people i met were awesome  the venue was ok. Sound was ok  Lights were good  Drinks were.. same as always. That's all there is to it.  Will come back  as i'm sure my favorite bands will play here eventually."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Being a musician myself  I'm an avid fan of music and listen to almost anything. However  rock & roll's always got a special place in my heart.  I heard that The Joint e got remodeled  and have been here twice after it. Both times have been nothing but a blast.  The minute you walk into the Hard Rock to get to your destination  you are greeted by employees in Crue shirts (or whatever else kind of residency is going on at that time--I went there for the Crue  so seeing staff running around in Crue shirts was pretty badass. It added to the overall 'concert' experience).  Then as you make the trek towards the venue  the sound of classic rock and 80s hair bands greets your ears ever so sweetly. I heard 'Dr. Feelgood' more than once at this place--now I wasn't sure if that was to promote Motley Crue's residency or what. Regardless  it was quite awesome to hear Vince Neil serenading me as I strutted towards the real thing.  Now I don't know if it's because The Joint has been renovated or what  but both times I've been there  security has moved the entrance all the way to the back...you can no longer enter directly in front. Instead  they make you this long detour; be warned  for you will get distracted. There is this Sexxy lingerie boutique in the midst of the detour called 'Love Jones' that will draw you in with their Girls  Girls  Girls as you make your way down the Sunset Strip. They sell Crue shirts  too (albeit overpriced).  Before completing your black carpet walk of fame  you'll first be told to pour your drinks (if you have any) into plastic cup provided by them (which is a plus). They also check for spiky studs and the like as well as oversized purses--sorry ladies  but you're only allowed to bring tiny ones.  Once you get past all of that  you'll be greeted by employees in costumes. They look as though they just came out of a Rob Zombie or Alice Cooper Halloween special. Oh  and also chicks walking around in stilts as well while dressed up in Tim Burtonesque  Victorian 'SteamGoth' attire. Motley Crue wasn't kidding when they said that fans would be spending an Evening in Hell.  Eventually  all that distraction clogs up the entrance a bit  which is kind of annoying although the security guys are able to do some crowd control.  Now depending on which show you're seeing  some parts are blocked off. When I was here for the Carnival of Madness tour  I was able to chill anywhere without security checking up on me. However  at the Crue's residency  I had balcony seating and was only allowed to be on the upper level. Security was very tight about seating as they were all assigned  and they WILL check your tickets. So if you're desperate to see your idols up close  you're SOL unless you become a groupie or so.  The view from the upper levels is kind of a miss. You'll be able to see the stage but will have a hard time making out the stars' faces. Also  the acoustics on the upper floors are just terrible. It just sounds like you're seeing a tribute band instead of the real deal. I don't recommend getting balcony seating unless you've seen said band several times and have already experienced them up front. However  there is this place on the side where you can stand and lean on the super-long counter for the rest of the concert. It's also a good place to put down your beer  too. You'll still get a good view from there.  Speaking of beer  buy some before you walk in--beer at The Joint is $12.  Also  depending on the show  ticket prices vary. The price I had to pay for the cheapest seats wasn't worth it. I paid $75 for the balcony  which was $5 more than what I paid for nosebleeds when I sent to see Rammstein at the Thomas & Mack Center back in May 2011. I don't know if this is because it's Motley Crue's sponsor or The Joint itself that charges this insane amount...still  I always recommend to buy at the box office because it seems like nearly every venue here is now partnered with the evil that is Ticketmaster. You don't have to pay the ridiculous $10 'service fees' if you buy your tix at the box office. Instead  the only thing you'll pay extra for are 'facility charges'  which should only be $4-5.  Sometimes you get what you pay for  sometimes you don't. At my first concert here (Carnival of Madness)  there were Steampunk performers on the floor that did some pre-show entertainment. I'm sure though that this is all provided by the bands themselves  although I doubt that its competition down the block (House of Blues at Mandalay Bay) would allow these kinds of things.  However  security is lax when it comes to things such as moshing and crowd-surfing. I saw a TON of crowd-surfing going on during the Carnival of Madness tour. The pit is big enough to do these things  so it's unlikely that security would be fast enough to catch you do these things if you're up to it.  From what I've experienced  The Joint does a good job of hosting concerts and making you feel like you're part of the rockstar atmosphere.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I loved this place. Came here for the Motley Crue concert on Sunday  Oct. 6  2013 for their final show together. What can I say  simply Awesome! Great view from any spot inside to watch a concert. I was on the floor  so it was crowded  but fun screaming and singing with other loyal fans.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This place is an awesome venue! I've been here twice  1st for Bon Jovi and 2nd for Denis Leary's Rescue Me Comedy Tour. Now the artists were the draw  of course  but The Joint and its staff truly ROCK!! Went to see Denis Leary 06-12-10 and he did NOT disappoint! He had his band and some other actors from the show and their own comedy shows. Lenny Claerke  Adam Farara . . . great! the band . . . WAY cool!  Husband played at a blackjack table for the 2 1/2 hours and left almost $600 up . .  that doesn't suck! I took 2 of my girls and one's boyfriend to the show  totally great that there's no age restriction  they all loved it there too! If you get the chance see an event here  you will NOT be sorry!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I came here for the Rock of Allegiance Tour featuring Volbeat  H.I.M.  All That Remains  and Airborne. The venue is a great wide open area highly conducive for acoustics. The sound system is impeccable. However  I was not a big fan of some sort of $9 beer night special they were running  but it is to be expected from any venue.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The last time I attended a concert here was over 10 years ago. That was when The Joint was a dinky little place that probably broke several fire codes because everyone was shoved into such a small space  smaller than other venues in Vegas. I recently came here for a Nine Inch Nails concert and was preparing for the worst  but to my surprise the venue's renovation has made it 100 times better than it was 10 years ago.   The Joint is well-ventilated  spacious  and has multiple floors. There's a large bar area located in the back on the ground floor. Cocktail waitresses also go around the venue throughout the event to take drink requests. Entering and exiting can sometimes be chaotic  but it wasn't a problem here. Even leaving from the parking garage is a smooth process. Security guards direct the traffic  allowing cars to get out of parking garage without creating a parking jam where you're stuck for hours.   In general the staff is organized  hospitable  and accommodating. One of my friends sprained her ankle weeks prior  so we were concerned she'd have to stand the entire time on her crutches. We were informed by staff that the section designated for wheelchairs was full; however  they found a spot for us next to that section and provided my friend with a chair to sit on. They told us it was ""the best they could do "" but it was more than what we asked for."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Surprisingly decent venue- larger than expected  back wall is a massive bar. Lines for drinks get long  and prices are predictably steep for generic draft beer  but the staff are friendly. In addition to bartenders  there are a lot of people cleaning and monitoring the crowd  which is a nice touch.  Bathrooms are huge with 20+ stalls  so getting in a trip between sets isn't a huge wait as it is at other venues. The acoustics are fairly good  but I found it odd that the general admission/floor area is divided up by odd iron rails- I understand they don't want a giant mosh pit going or anything  it's an unusual setup.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"The Joint. Cool venue in HRH and I'm here with my sons to see Motley Crue. On the surface I'm watching 4 middle aged men wearing costumes from the first Mad Max movie. The singer is a little portly but he whirls around like someone far younger and although he clearly cannot sing his energy levels are quite impressive. Tommy Lee  of Pamela Anderson fame  plays a drum kit strapped into what seem like a rollercoaster  he is strapped in and plays a drum solo whilst hanging upside down and spinning in this contraption. Quite incredible.   There are flamethrowers  dancing girls  midgets (little people ..oops)  fireworks BIG light show and screens . They keep reminding the audience "" how crazy "" they are and the crowd laps it up.   So horrible music from a band from a different and worse time but I grudgingly admit the show is fantastic. From start to finish  the energy is high  the crowd is going bananas  every song is familiar. Truly excellent  even a non fan like me could not fail to enjoy the spectacle of a Crue show. They are here for another few days and you should go. Tickets are cheap  The Joint is the right location and I highly recommend."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"What in the hell?  The ""best"" seats are actually made of cheap metal folding chairs with stained cushions?  Free-flowing booze and douchebags that can't follow simple directions (HELLO!  There's no smoking in the venue  dipshits!!  Security told you 20 times!)  Getting beer spilled on me while watching the Axl Rose and Friends Show (aka Guns 'N Roses) on my man's birthday?  You're gonna get a fist in your face!  With that being said  whose idea was it to make The Joint entirely of concrete?  It just makes the acoustics very shitty and I could barely hear Axl Rose sing!  I don't recall Axl sounding terrible when I saw GNR back in March at the Wiltern in LA.  Ugh  I really felt like shanking some bitches afterward...  Would love to see GNR again.  Just not at ""The Joint""."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Big and air conditioned! It's the next best thing to an outdoor venue. It was great. If you going to a show here and aren't looking to stay at the Hard Rock  the Rumor across the street has decent priced rooms that aren't too shabby. It's a bargain hotel without having to lower yourself to a motel 6 or the Budget Hotel.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,The theater has too many exit signs  it's quite distracting. Saw my boy bo burnham here and even though the show was great the venue was not. Chairs were set up in a way that is very difficult to see the stage. They made me throw out my water at the entrance and then charged $8 for a water inside. Dehydrating people to turn a profit should be illegal and I frown upon any establishment that does so.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Dear The Joint  You used to be really awesome. You were a great open space. I didn't have to walk around 10 barriers to get to get to the bar. I never felt like I was being herded like cattle. And you used to have an incredible sound system.  Why did you have to go and grow up into this big impersonal venue with all these tiers   bars blocked off from the floor  and a crap ass soundsystem. I used to love seeing bands at the joint but when everything is turned up so high that all sound gets distorted  it makes me never want to visit you again.   Please fix yourself.   Love  Allison C.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,We've seen several concerts here dating back to 2007  but the most recent one being Incubus on 9/5/15. This show is what I am basing my review on.   Doors opened at 7 and we were sure to make it there when doors opened. We had GA (General Admission) tickets  and to get a good spot up front and center it's a good idea to go early. Because we arrived early  the ticket scanners and purse checker lines were non existent  and we walked right in.   We grabbed drinks at the main bar toward the back (furthest from the stage) but were happy to see a small bar set up right down in the GA area.   The concert started promptly at 8:30pm. The sound carried through the venue perfectly  no overly annoying bass that shakes your teeth and eyeballs and takes away from the clarity  but perfect volume and good for the ears of all concert goers  no matter their location within the place. Ushers and Security were attentive but not instrusive. Bar lines didn't take long at all. Drink prices are standard 'near the Strip' prices. Self parking was a breeze  we just drove up to the highest floor and parked there. Added bonus-nice view of the High Roller with the sun setting on the Strip  as we walked into the Hard Rock.   Nice venue  perfect for smaller sized shows with a more intimate feel. Can't wait for our next concert here  which I hope is very soon.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue!  We came here for the 311 Fan Party that featured 311 music  Polynesian dancers  and an Arial artist. Drinks were inexpensive and the vibe was great! It was pretty amazing! My only beef is that there was no sitting room and at one point I got really hot and claustrophobic so I sat down out of the way by the mirrored wall because I felt like I was going to faint.  A security came up and rather than making sure I was okay he was rude.  I told him I wasn't feeling well and just needed to sit for a minute.  He said my options were to get up or go to the medic.  I just got up and went to an open area to get fresh air and I was okay  but that jerk really irked me!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"I've only seen two concerts at The Joint at the Hard Rock Hotel. Both times the headlining band was Slayer. Basically  to see a concert here the headliner needs to be substantial and have the ability to pull in huge crowds. I actually quite like this venue because of the awesome visibility  acoustics  slightly inclined floors  and guardrails on the upper parts of the floor. Height challenged folks like me can take comfort in better being able to see the live acts. If you still can't see  don't fret! There's two huge screens on each side of the stage with live coverage of the show. I love the guardrails as well because it's always nice to be able to lean on something when you're on your feet for 3+ hours. Guardrails are not in place on the ""main floor"" near the stage. Rest assured  crazy most pits can and will take place here during metal concerts.   The only reason I'm taking a star off is because the bar is a total shit show. It took my husband over 15 minutes to get a few beers at the bar. Other than this annoyance  The Joint is a solid spot for concerts!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #17"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Went to the Santana show On Saturday Jan 8. Santana rocked  the acoustics seemed very good to me  the bars weren't too crowded and the restrooms were clean. Yeah!!   Had bought my ticket on the web some time ago and  had it held at will call. Guy was friendly enough. Just needed my id not the credit card too  Couldn't find the reservation. Way nervous I ask him if maybe it was for Friday  the previous night. EEK yes there it is. I'm thinking maybe they'll give me a discount or something for a new ticket as I really want to see the show. The guy GIVES me a ticket. A really good ticket like the one I had. I'm so happy .   I'm going to spread the word for the Joint! Concert venues tend to treat you neutrally at best  like small children generally  and sometimes (The friggin Woodlands) like concentration camp victims. Great customer service at The Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"came here for TIESTO'S concert a week ago...IT. WAS. EXCELLENT!  first of all  although the event was sold out  they didn't sell too many tickets  so that the main floor  which was pretty small  never got too crowded and packed. we could dance to our heart's desires without bumping ass with everyone  and we were able to walk and move around freely. the second and third floors were also comfortably full. i was almost jealous that they had seating available. besides the bar in the back there was a random drink station on the main floor near the stage which i kept going back to to get cups of just ice  since WATER WAS $15.   you don't miss much if you arrive after 11pm because the first opening DJ played extremely mellow music and we were all bored as fuck. no one was dancing. it felt like we were at a cocktail party.   the second opener (hardwell) started playing more energetic and intense music and got the party started...more people started coming to life but it was still less than half the crowd  tiesto didn't come on until 1am  wearing a small pink t-shirt  but once he did  it was nonstop hard beats  new tracks  old tracks  tracks from his kaleidoscope album  and remixed classics. his set was pure energy and happiness. even up until 5am when i had no energy left he was still bumping intense music. the lights were pretty entertaining  and confetti and streamers periodically rained down from the ceiling...my faaavorite! near the end he played an moving remix of ""forever young"" that made me want to cry bittersweet tears. fack.   you can go in and out as long as you present your ticket  and you can bring drinks in. attire varied widely...ranging from shorts and t-shirts  to dresses and heels for girls  to dress shirts and jeans for guys which eventually turned into wifebeaters and jeans...i wore a dress (because vegas is sexy time) and flip flops so my feet wouldn't get destroyed.  tiesto's concert here was SO worth the $50. i loved every second of his set!  p.s. my friend lost his ticket before the concert (i have no idea how)  and once they saw his utterly devastated expression  the people were nice enough to print him a whole new one for free."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Good sound quality and great visuals. We went for Chelsea Wolfe and Queens of the Stone Age.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came here to see Linkin' Park! Great Venue at the Hard Rock Hotel to watch a gig.  JBL Sound system is awesome  standing room usually and two great bars!  Had a blast so check out the calendar to see who's playing if you're coming to Vegas   I hope to be back some day soon.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,It's a crappy venue  I don't know how they figure tying some cheap chairs together in unelevated rows will make for a lovely outing. At $150 a pop to see Cedric the Entertainer  I expected my buns to at least feel comfortable. I was squirming da whole time  so uncomfortable. To top that off  we had two fat ladies sitting on both sides  forcing us to be even closer together. Like fuck  come onnnnnn. They're packing sardines for our bucks.  To top that off  there were hecklers from the balcony level that went unregulated  unchecked by staff. Is that how they maintain the integrity of their shows? Stupid bitch from up top kept shouting random shit to the stage. AND there's a bitch somewhere to my left with a deafening hoot. Pierced my ear every time  even when I got a fat lady blockage.   They've cocktail waitresses circulating to get you drink orders or you can get em yourself  shimmy in n out n having your ass in others' faces.  If there was gradual elevation to the seating design  I couldn't tell cuz if you got a big n tall sitting in front of you then you are screwed.  At least the parking is uncomplicated. It's just in their garage and plenty of spaces even on event night. The Joint is on the far side of casino  a bit of a walk.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,What's with the mediocre average on this place? The Joint is the best medium sized venue in Vegas! If more of the acts I want to see at the big places like  MGM Grand Arena or Mandalay Bay played at the Joint  I'd be racking up my Southwest Rapid Rewards and would be getting over there almost every weekend.   I've been to this venue twice so far. Once for Kings of Leon  and most recently for Area 107.9's Big Damn Holiday Jam with Bloc Party  Franz Ferdinand  and the Ting Tings. I didn't notice any issues with the sound. Then again  I'm all the way up front so I'm too busy singing and dancing along to everything.   The security staff there is one of the best I've seen. The minute I had some people trying to push me too hard against the rail  I called a security guy over and he took care of the crowd immediately. And when the front row were visibly parched and sweaty- security crew's there with bottles of water for anybody asking for some. I wish more venues in LA could be as good as these guys are.  And what's cool about this venue too is that they're not strict with the searching process. It probably depends on who's playing that night  but each time I've gone I haven't been searched.   I know the Joint's supposed to close down sometime in 2009 for renovation to add some more VIP spots. I hope it doesn't change too much. As long as that floor stays as GA  I'll be down to go to more shows at the Joint.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Came hear and saw Journey this weekend.   My girlfriend's family and I went.   I had never been here   but I was impressed.   I think the staff and management did a great job at the logistics of it all.   Drinks were a little pricey   but that is a minor detail.   The seating was awesome   stage lighting was great   sound was perfect   and every seat seemed to be a good seat.     Another minor detail   staff should keep an eye out for random people taking empty paid seats that aren't theirs.   Overall   a great first experience.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Overall a pretty great venue. It's set up so you can see well from any seat in the house. Plenty of bars and restrooms available which is nice for a venue this size. I always prefer a seat to standing room and the seats at the top don't disappoint. We could easily see even with all the seats in front of us filled. The sound guys did an excellent job of ensuring the instruments didn't drown out the vocals. What's even better is prices are reasonable too.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Venue was great.  A draft beer and a bottle of water was $21; close to the price of admission.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue but the security guards were a little too rude for my liking. Sound system was great though
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I was there with my wife for Tiesto in Concert at 04/02/11.   I researched the hell out of it before getting tix. DO NOT BE AFRAID to contact them with your questions. I think I have sent a ton of emails to them and to Tiesto's hosting company. Responses were very fast and very informational. After getting enough info to convince me (LOL)  I got GA tix.  We got there at around 10:30 pm. Entrance was with no line at all. They do ask you to pour all your drinks (if you have) in their plastic cups but security is not padding you in search of ... whatever. Here is the note to complainers on 15$ bottle of water (it is really 15$  I have bought it) - there is free in and out !!!! if you don't want to spend 15$ - get your ass out  get water and get back in :) I was too lazy to get out  plus music was too good to leave  so I bought that famous 15$ water.  Bartenders were nice overall. They were giving me ice for free with no bitching  and that's why were tipped for.   Crowd was small and pretty mellow at that hour  but as second opening DJ (Adrian Lux) got on stage it got bigger... and bigger... and bigger... and fu****g bigger!!! By the time he was done and they have announced Tiesto (about 12:30 - 1 am)  it was like a sardine can! With PHENOMENAL opening  the RAVE began. Yeah... some of the characters that we saw were flying sooooo high  they could not even reach themselves LOL Some were very disgusting  some were sleeping in standing position but that is the beauty of GA :) We had great crowd around us and after jumping nonstop for few hours we called it quits... went to just wonder around the club.  VIP tables have very nice location  security  waitresses  seating areas  designated space with no crowd. If you are considering to go with crowd over 10 peeps - think of paying a little more and  getting one. Cause you can be in GA if you want and back in seating area if you want  no one checks your tickets once you are in and there is almost no seating area in GA area. There is smocking allowed inside  which is a bit too much for GA area but overall ventilation does its job pretty good. You'll still stink like an ashtray in the morning no mater what.     Summary: YES YES and YES!!! This is a killa-venue for Tiesto! A bit pricey  but what do you expect from Vegas.  Be smart ;)
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,At a show now. The venue is top notch. The security is short tempered and on a power trip. We almost left because of the attitudes and confrontational demeanor. Other than the uptight personnel and cameras all over making you feel like a criminal  it's a nice place. Doubt we will return to this venue  the House of Blues is sooooooo much better.  Drinks are way too expensive as well!!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"First off  this review is for the venue itself  and NOT the band. Second  this is my first concert so my viewpoint on it will be a bit skewed.   Anyways  so the venue itself seemed to be pretty standard in size  although having several floors definitely was pretty cool. Sound system was amazing though  it got loud without any signs of distortion. Light show that accompanied the show was also top-notch.   In terms of crowd size  however  it seems like the show was oversold  it was packed on the lower floors. Which would have been ok in itself  but our ""assigned seats"" we're practically useless unless you were sitting on the balcony. I can understand that since it's standing room only  that you wouldn't be able to sit exactly where you bought  but it should be pretty close or at least in the same section  right?? We ended up standing further back from the stage from our section since everyone just flooded the front. At least having some staff directing people to their sections would have been nice considering that people paid MORE for some tickets than others.   Overall  the A/V system was amazing  but the staff's control of the situation was sorely lacking. Would I come back to the Joint? Depends who's playing. Then again  maybe I just need to go to more concerts."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This is my go to! I remember when it first opened thinking this place will never make it as its too far off the strip and felt that there was not enough parking. Now these are the two qualities I enjoy the most. The casino atmosphere is top notch and of course if you like the hard rock you have to love the music that comes with it. Thank you for the guys at Track Results for making it possible
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Awesome venue. Rascal Flatts and Barrett Baber were amazing! Drink prices are just stupid. I know everything in Vegas is more expensive but this place takes the cake. $26 for a couple of Bud Light drafts!
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Removed from our seats at the Rascal Flatts concert for standing and dancing. We were told that the people in section 302 paid to sit - too bad the tickets didn't say that. We just wanted to enjoy the show but our experience was spoiled. Security escorted us downstairs and threatened to throw us out if we irritated anyone else. Well  we were irritated. The worst part was that the guard just dumped us out onto the floor and did not communicate with her colleagues  so we couldn't even get into this other section they sent us to. Thanks a lot.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,System of  A Down one night  Chimaira/Danzig the next. Horribly mixed sound on both nights. Thank goodness for earplugs. Someone spill a beer into the mixer...hopefully it'll electrocute the soundman. Took forever to get out too. Added extra star for the free Jager I got from tranny-looking promoter.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Horrible service! Long waits  they don't even have real lemonade but they don't tell their customers that  and if you go to a different bartender they can't even replace your drink!!! So you have to wait another 40 min for a drink! Worst concert experience ever. Will never come back here
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,Great venue for acoustics and stage visibility. The G&A section is a tiered concrete floor (only downside) and the seating at the back of the hall seemed alright (although a little further back than I care for).  I plan to more shows here and recommend for a concert.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,General Admission Balcony tickets (no floor access) for Tiesto on April 2  2011.  From what I can actually recall...  I had fun.  What's most important to me at a concert though  is comfort - and that's why I rarely attend any back home in Hawaii (those tend to be pretty crowded  with long lines to get in and no seat left empty - as well as super hot with all the people packed in the place).  We arrived there about 1-1.5 hour(s) late - parking was easy to find  souvenir items weren't already sold out  there was no entry line  smoking was allowed and hardly anyone was actually sitting in the balcony seats lol.  All in all  it was great - and I would definitely go back here  maybe even to see Tiesto again ;-)
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Came here in August as saw the Legends of Hip Hop Tour  which was a fun/interesting crowd. Hip hop crosses many generations and cultures so you saw the old school people who were probably the same age as Slick Rick (who rocked it but is probably somebody's grandpa now as he didn't move a whole lot  lol) to younger folks whose parents probably raised them on the music  so they were there out of respect and curiosity. Kinda like how I'd check out the Temptations or Earth Wind and Fire.   It was a good sized crowd that night but not so much where people were hot and uncomfortable  so that was good.   I bought the side balcony GA tickets and thought they were pretty good. Since I'm not one to be on the GA floor and being squished anymore (or trying to handshake the performer) I enjoyed being above the crowd and seeing everything. The side GA balcony has pretty good views especially the closer you get to the stage. Because it's GA you do have to get there earlier to score a space at the railing. I like how because you're standing already you can dance and groove as you are. With seats  you have to be courteous of others around you. Can't be standing up the whole time unless everyone else is.   As a lot of people have mentioned  there really is no bad seat in the house and the acoustics/sound was great. It's large enough but small enough. The tickets you buy really depends on how ""involved"" you'd like to be at your concert. Standing GA is always in the thick of the action and the bouncing/dancing crowd. Seats will get you comfort at a distance and again  the GA up above gives you a little bit of both.  The bummers is that if you buy balcony tickets  they will not let you mingle downstairs and vice versa  however there are bars all over this facility so there wasn't any lines for anything  even the bathrooms!   I'd definitely see another concert here again if given the opportunity."
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This review is primarily for the VIP Ticket Package and seating in sections 201 & 202 of The Joint.  I've seen concerts before at ground level and SRO.  The configuration of standing or seating varies from show to show.  Keep in mind  for seated events  people will stand up in front of you once the concert starts.  My suggestion is if you have discretionary income to blow  and you're not up for standing  get seats at a table in one of the VIP sections.    In sections 201 & 202 (one floor up from ground level on either side)  you pay a premium for seats at tall tables for four.  If you're just a couple  you'll be seated with someone else.  However  there's plenty of room to move your chairs around to create your own personal space.  If you wanna splurge  you can buy the table for yourself.  For VIP  you get personally escorted from the ticket office to your seats.  You skip the line.  All of your cocktails are comped.  So  if you get seated early  you can enjoy more free adult beverages.  You have your own waitress who serves you.  You tip her at the end of the night.  The restroom attendant (only on the men's side) hands out complimentary snacks (including chips  nuts and candy) and other goodies.  Overall  going the VIP route is a pretty cool experience with less hassle than being in the mix of the SRO crowd.
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,I don't love Vegas.... But I do love The Black Crowes! Seeing The Crowes at The Joint in The Hardrock was amazing! I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the security was and the sound system was top notch! I rocked out in the front row all night! I just might head back to Vegas for another awesome band at The Joint sometime ;)
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,"Just to note that this venue wasn't actually closing -- it was being renovated/updated.  ""Official re-opening"" weekend is 4/17/09 with The Killers playing the 17th  and Paul McCartney playing the 19th  though some stuff has taken place in the new space already.  Can someone who has attended since it re-opened describe the GA space ?? I am trying to decide how soon to get there for a decent spot...  Thanks  KB"
Arts & Entertainment;Music Venues;Nightlife,This was a much bigger venue than I had expected.  That is not meant to be negative  it was just shocking to us when we arrived.  We saw Roger Daltrey perform there and had a good time.  The drinks were pricey  but that's Vegas.    This was one of the cleanest venues we had been in and we really enjoyed easy bar and bathroom access.  We would be happy to see another show here in the future.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Fun club  the cashier was very nice and cute I came in for my brother birthday and had a good time. The only thing all the girls are skinny way too skinny like they don't eat. I'm a breast and butt guy and all the girls in there have fake butts. There's no variety in there at all. They all have the same body type very boring choices of girls
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,I had a great time shopping at Hustler Hollywood. There were so many products to look at! The staff was polite and professional  not pushy or creepy. A very female friendly shop. They answered my questions  thanked me and said they hoped to see me again. Great customer service and definitely not your average adult store.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Great selection of blow up dolls and the prices can't be beat! I purchased a silicone torso from here with two holes. This thing feels like the real deal! Good grief it is amazing. Now  it was a little expensive at $279 but worth every freakin' penny! I highly recommend this store and anytime I am in Vegas  I go here!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Great prices and even better staff. They were so helpful. I'll definitely be returning to the store- huge selection of clothes
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Very nice adult store with great sales. They have a small but nice book section  many varieties of lube  and enough toys to keep most couples occupied for days. I really liked their limited but gorgeous selection of plus size lingerie. While it doesn't have the positive FemPower vibe of the Love Store  the male staff was friendly and helpful  and it was a positive shopping experience. I will return.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,"This is the store attached to Larry Flint's strip club.  They have lots of fun items  and it's worth the visit.  This is the review I left for the club:  I'm a fan of strip clubs.  I'm sure a lot of girls are  but I'm one of the few gals that will often go by myself. This was not the case while in Vegas however.  I went with my man and 5 other girls who work for my company.  We started the night off by calling a number that said free limo.  It turns out it was a totally free limo.  That was surprising.  We tipped the limo guy 20 bucks and he seemed pleased. I hope we didn't stiff him.  Then we headed in to see the dancers.  We rolled up about 10 pm on a Tuesday  and it seemed mellow  but not totally dead.  We heard some big names were going to start around 11.  The manager Tommy was delightful  respectful  and reminded me of a mob boss.  (In a good way  not bad.)  I felt safer with him in charge  but he really is a character out of the Sopranos.    Our waitress (dammit  I forget her name but she was amazing too)  was attentive  attractive  and even after misquoting a drink  came and told me she made an error and gave us more change.  That honesty was refreshing  and we tipped her more at the end of the night.  The dancers were hit and miss. Some were busted  (which I didn't expect at a place as high profile as this) and some were top quality and amazing. We were there to see Katie Morgan from Zack and Miri  and Teagan Presley from so many delicious porn movies  like Pirates. They were both sexy as hell  and we dropped most of our 1's on them  and they hung out with us a bit. I am used to California rules  so it was fun being able to grab and touch the strippers. They even encouraged it. We had a great time.    The loss of one star comes from an incident with my man that I wasn't even there to witness:  A stripper with a banging body but busted face asked to take him on a ""tour"" so her manager wouldn't get mad. He knew the sales pitch was coming  but it turned out to be so much more. The second he was around the corner she unzipped his pants and led him around by his penis.  (That doesn't bother me at all  it's actually cute). She brought him to a private room where she laid out the prices for dances  and then blowjobs and sex.  It's Vegas  so again  not really bothersome. She said ""No girl that you came with will wrap your lips around your dick"". He told her that yes... one  maybe even two would (LOL) and she responds with ""They are all fat and ugly... why would you want that??""  Holy cow!  I get the sales pressure  but insulting a group of girls that are dropping money (Two of which have actually been in Playboy) is a bit ratchet and low class. He asked if she would be willing to have sex with me as well as him and she gave him a disgusted look and left. I guess not. If you are gonna charge for sex  you might as well bang the girls as well.  The drinks are pricey  so if you don't have at least 100 to spend on drinks  and 50+ to tip your waitress  don't go.  It's insulting and shows you are cheap if you complain. We were thrifty about our spending and still dropped $300.  The limo returned to bring us to our hotel  and we tipped $30 this time  so hopefully he likes us  and we aren't being cheap about that.  Overall  a really fun night out in Vegas."
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,We go there twice a month to the club ... but to the store t h w are always friendly  great specials ... BUT OF COURSE NO TO MANY TO CHOOSE. ..LOL but if your found your size  .... U are in luck  Keep it up you guys ...
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Tommy is the bomb an thanks for making sure all of us ladies were good!!! If you come ask for Tommy!!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Flashy! This is what I expect from a store on the strip.  Except that it's not. It's near by  to be sure  and it's a winner when it comes to adult stores! It's worth the visit if you're looking for lingerie or even costume bits.    If you're looking for a selection of toys? They have some  but there are places with better selections. I was mildly upset they didn't have the vampire paddle (A hustler item) that I was looking for!  Ah well  next time.   Right now  (Nov 2013) they had a sale that all Hustler branded merchandise was 50% off. I don't know if it was just for that location or not  but hey  I got a shot glass for $2.50.  :)
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,This is a beautiful  fancy  upscale  spacious overpriced adult store. Lots of novelties and cool things to see. You could probably find most of the things here online for half the price. Some of the items were really marked up. This place is perfect for divorce  bachelor and bachelorette party items.   PROS: Clean and bright inside             Fun things to see and buy  CONS: Mark up on prices
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,If you want great customer service with friendly  fun employees that make product knowledge a priority  please visit Hustler Hollywood.  From bachelorette party surprises  Hustler apparel   lingerie  products for bath and body  sensual care and not to mention toys to fit your every desire  Hustler Hollywood has it all.   It's a clean  bright  beautiful boutique that ensures you leave with a smile on your face  if only in anticipation of using your new purchases. ;-)
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Not only does this place have all the stuff a single person or couple would be looking for to feel sexy  the staff is amazingly friendly and knowledgeable. They make something that's usually represented as seedy and make it truly fun!  I know where I'll be going for all my fun times supplies!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,After spending 200 bucks on lingerie for me  my husband tried returning a top that was missing a hook. He wouldn't know he's a man and quite frankly idk if I'd even notice it in the store as it's 2 pieces  but of course and understandably so you cannot try on the bottoms. The piece that is missing is the piece that connects the 2. Very disappointed. Waste of money on something we can't use. They could have switched out the top  i would've happily kept the bottoms. We have tons of shops between centennial hills and your location. He went there because of the name and the reviews but what a bust; never again. I run a business so I understand policy  but as a manager myself I also not that not everything is black and white. There are some gray areas and sometimes you just have to do what's right and what will ensure a returning patron. Your staff blew it. I will never return and you can bet I will tell at least 10 people. What kind of business do you want to run?
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,I come here everytime I visit Vegas. I shop here with my daughter :) We just like to stroll around and look for whatever catches our eyes  or whatever we are in the mood for. Sometimes they have great clearance items which I am always on the lookout for. Some things can be a bit pricy and the employes are always pleasant. They are well stocked on most items and the store is always clean and organized :)
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Han hecho muchos cambios  que triste que solo el area de para las mujers este en fines de semana ojala solucionen eso pronto!!!!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,I would have to say  I'm a little disappointed in the shop.   While the store itself is quite large  I didn't feel that their corset selection was that great. They didn't have a decent size selection.  Some items were even frazzled at the edges  on the verge of being torn.   The sales associate was decent  and greeted us  but other than helping in getting a fitting room  she wasn't very attentive.   I can't say that I will be back any time soon.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Great products and staff. Everyone was very helpful and knowledgeable about their adult toys. They have some of the coolest  most innovated and best products on the market. Some of the toys I had never seen before. We went in just to browse and ended up with a bag full of goodies.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,This store has everything you could want from an adult store and more! They have great adult merchandise  they also have tons of lingerie and great clothing and handbags. The staff are very helpful and never pushy and it's an over-all great experience.   Whether you are a Vegas local or just visiting  I highly recommend stopping by this store to check it out!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Make sure you come to Hustlers! Definitely the BEST club in Vegas! Hands down! The best dancers  waitresses and Host! Nothing like the other clubs that just overlook u and treat u like crap! Make sure to ask for Lovely and her friends when U stop by!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,When I think of hustler club I think About my second family !!!! I've worked for the Deja Vu Hustler company since 2008 and proud to say I love my club and my bosses and co workers !!!! My club has the most charisma and spunk there is !!! We also probably have the nicest staff around !!! Let me get in a little on the staff of my club   We have for starters Ralph probably one of the most easy going mangers I've ever met in my life!!

So in conclusion to all come try out our club even if you been here and didn't likening the first time .. I promise you you will enjoy it!!! Come join us on industry nights every Sunday free drinks till 12 am
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,I have been here twice now looking for fun novelty gifts for my bridesmaids and also to get some inspiration for my Bachelorette Party!  Both times we came we were given tons of fun ideas and had a good time while we were there. We never felt uncomfortable being there  if anything we wanted to stay longer!  Great place  a little pricey but I think that comes along with the name brand of being a Hustler Store.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Omg!  Awesome show!  Ladies it's a must see!  They make sure you are taken care of and satisfied!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Leo is a rockstar!  Great time!  From the exceptional transportation to the pretty girls and hunky guys!  Will definitely go back!  Jessica Alba look alike OMG!  Thanks Leo!  You made my first trip to Vegas memorable!  Bravo!
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,Stopped here to grab some Bachelorette favors  games and decorations.  This store is pretty cool.  They have all kinds of adult stuff.  Clothing  costumes  toys  everything!!  The guy that helped us was really cool (I wish I remembered his name) and knowledgeable.  He talked to us girls for a long time about all the different sex toys.  It was informative to say the least.
Fashion;Adult;Shopping;Lingerie,James Kirk was the greatest. He made the accommodation very smoothly for our party. My first coming here and it was the best experience. We had so much fun! Thank you James your are awesome.
Shopping;Eyewear & Opticians,Tanya was awesome!  This chic eyewear boutique located inside Fashion Mall on the second floor near the Yellow Parking garage entrance is awesome.  Eye doc on premises too. Tanya was friendly  polite  patient.  They have Oliver Peoples prescription eyewear here. I couldn't find them at Lenscrafters or Optic (also located at this mall)  Tanya was attentive without being overbearing. No high pressure sales.  I swear I looked at all the frames here and although I still couldn't decide on prescription eyewear to buy  she was still very courteous.    Bonus on this shopping day? Just saw Cilo Green walk by!
Shopping;Eyewear & Opticians,"Attentive customer service and solid suggestions  didn't feel pressure to buy  and helped adjust the frame after purchasing and walking around for awhile  then returning.  Didn't have the ""ichiban wow facta"" doe so I shan't be assigning a coveted five star review."
Shopping;Eyewear & Opticians,"This is a review for their old location at Fashion Show.  I haven't been to the Crystals location yet.  Their selection of Tom Ford sunglasses was much broader than what Saks and Neiman Marcus carried.  They had some styles hidden away in drawers  so be sure to ask if you don't see or cannot find what you want.  I received excellent customer service here from a salesman  who helped me find a perfect pair that didn't make me look like I had a unibrow or rest on my cheeks.  He informed me of their ""bring back the broken pair and get a discount on a replacement"" warranty  a feature that Saks and Neiman didn't offer.  My purchase was packaged in a fancy maroon-purple net cloth-like bag with ribbon (they've since switched to black paper  from what I've received at the local Ilori stores)  and he included all of the relevant Tom Ford packaging (case  lens cloth  warranty card).    I love my rose gold Tom Ford aviators  and they've held up incredibly well over the years  despite falling several times on to concrete!  They've outlived cheaper plastic Armani Exchange (stores say they can't change the nose pads) and 7 for all Mankind (coating was peeling) pairs  and are more versatile than my Burberry pair.  Their fuzzy brown velvet-wrapped case broke at the hinges though.  Happily  a saleswoman at the Scottsdale Fashion Ilori gave me an extra Prada case they had lying around  so my treasured shades continue to be safe!  Don't be afraid to ask for a free cleaning.  They also have (had?) an unlimited refill travel-size lens cleaner spray bottle  though it sadly (for a guy) looks like a lipstick case.  Another option is their gel spray cleaner that seems to work better than the liquid sprays.  I have been told I ""look like a cop"" in my Tom Fords  and I take that as a compliment!"
Shopping;Eyewear & Opticians,Cool people and fast services. We well my boys bought dun sun glasses tom ford. They are in love with them. While I got my self some cartier santos limited edition sunglasses.   Nice place had a great collection of sunglasses
Restaurants;German;Delis,Such a shame this place closed.   A greedy landlord forced the tenant out and has had an empty building on his hands since.    The food was awesome and the ambiance was very Munich.   I will miss this place.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Very disappointing... My wife & I had lunch here this past weekend  and were really looking forward to it  as we ate here years ago and really liked it.  I don't know why it's so bad now; maybe they've Americanized the food to attract more non-German customers.  But my wife is from Bavaria  and this ain't Bavarian food! The potato soup had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever.  The jagerschnitzel wasn't breaded normally  and the mushroom gravy wasn't very good.  The sauerkraut tasted like it was served from a can  and NO German restaurant should be serving mashed potatoes! The only good thing about the place was that they had Franziskaner Heifenweiser  although they were charging $7 a bottle! And to top things off  their prices are very expensive.  Lunch for two was over $70!
Restaurants;German;Delis,Never again!! Nobody acknowledges your arrival and you are left kind of hanging at the front door (please wait to be seated sign) until someone finally notices that you are waiting and yells from behind the counter to take a seat anywhere.  It took 10 minutes to even get a beer ordered (bottled Hoffbrau at $8 for a half liter-ouch  and no imported draft). The uninspired menu is WAY overpriced for the mediocre quality even if the portions are ample  who cares to eat a bunch of slop. I've lived and traveled throughout Germany and this restaurant with an owner who obviously doesn't care about customer satisfaction wouldn't survive for 1 year. I guess if I want to eat German food again in Las Vegas I would have to opt for the Hoffbrau Haus Las Vegas. Go to Cafe Heidelberg at your own risk-you will most likely be disappointed and overcharged. Caveat Emptor
Restaurants;German;Delis,Add me to the list of fans of this unsophisticated vegas throwback. Located in the same strip mall where Lefty Rosenthal got blown up and lived  this is a slightly divey German restaurant that has excellent weinerschnitzel and a hell of a sausage plat. Things are tough these days  and their market items have dwindled. I think their bar area may be closed for most purposes  and their a little tight with the free bread  but gracious when asked for more. The spaetzl is tops  too. I suggest staying away from hofbrauhaus unless you're looking for a drunkfest and go here instead. There's a of the beaten path German place in Pahrump that's good  too.
Restaurants;German;Delis,the best German food was at the Pocker palace a number of years ago when they had some special buffet ..great food all you can eat at a low price  .those days are gone.    This place is better than the Hoffbrau House  but not much better.  Not worth the money.   For the price the food should be better or at least the atmosphere.  Vegas is not the place for German food 
Restaurants;German;Delis,AVOID THIS PLACE  SERIOUSLY!  Best bets:   Bier? Don't waste your money at this place. Lee's has a decent selection of the German stuff for cheap)  the Freakin' Frog has a great selection  but a little more pricey.  Food? Go to Hofbrau when it's quiet  the prices are pretty much the same (tip: It may be loud  but eat there during the 2010 World Cup; we went during Euro 2008 for the Germany-Turkey semi-final; it was intense  most REAL germans I've ever seen in Vegas in one place);   German Market? Go to the International Market on Decatur & Tropicana  they have a wider selection of foods; and enough German ingredients for you to make any dish that would put the Cafe Heidelberg to shame.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Cafe Heidelberg  where do I start? The food was very good. I have lived in Germany for a long time and I can say that the food was very authentic. We had a triple course menu with German potato soup (VERY GOOD)  schnitzel baked with ham and Swiss cheese  and dessert ( I ordered the Schwarzwaelder Kirchtorte = Black forest cherry cake and my husband had the Apfelstrudel with Vanilla sauce). The entree came with a side of potato salad and spaetzle. Thinking about the warm potato salad makes my mouth water:) Service was good. She over spilled my husband's beer... He almost cried lol Beers were imported and brought back some memories. All in all  I think this place is a little too pricey. Ok. the portions are big  but honestly I would rather have smaller portions and pay less for it. I still have my restaurant.com coupon that I couldn't use that day  because they only work on the normal entrees and not the special menu. Might go back  not sure yet...
Restaurants;German;Delis,Our monthly dining group picked Cafe Heidelberg for dinner before one of our events.  It was my first time ever trying German food  although I've seen plenty on Food Network and Travel Channel.  There was 5 of us and we decided on sharing 4 entrees  the Farmer's Plate  The Schnitzel combo  Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls  all about $28+ each  kinda steep  I know...  Out of the 4 entrees  my favorite was the cabbage rolls  it was moist and flavorful.  The other dishes were just okay.  The deep fried pork was slightly dry.  I think my favorite thing about the meal was the red cabbage.  Their sauerkraut was good too but the red cabbage was delicious!  For desert  we got two apples strudels and the chocolate cherry cake.  The strudels were good  but that chocolate cake was AWESOME  not too sweet.  Overall  food was good  but would I return? Hmm  not sure  maybe if someone invited me =)
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Authentic  delicious German food  definitely worth going off the beaten track for!  We had a coupon for 1/2 off a second dinner  but it turned out that on Monday  they have select meals (mostly pork dishes) buy one  get one free!!  My husband and I ordered the Oktoberfest meal (bratwurst and breaded pork  spaetzle  and red cabbage) and the pork schnitzel (breaded) with mushrooms in a wine sauce (Delish!!)  and BOY did we get a lot of food!  We even ate it for lunch the next day because it was so much food!    Cafe Heidelberg requires a keen eye to spot it (it is across a parking lot and kind of behind another building) but it has a big blue awning with big letters so we found it okay.  They were nice enough to serve us even though we came 15 minutes before ""closing"" - they serve until 8pm  then lock the doors  so it's best to get there 7:30 or earlier.  They have a market in the front  but in the back they have charming little wooden booths and German memorabilia all over the walls.    Our food came pretty quickly  and it was the best German meal I've had in a restaurant  and it's definitely the best German food in Vegas.  The staff was very nice  and we spoke for quite a while to our server about the shortage of German restaurants in Nevada and California.    I loved their red cabbage... and the mushroom-covered schnitzel was savory... I hope to go back and try their sauerbraten.  I would have if they hadn't had the 2-for-1 deal on their pork dishes.  I also want to try their sauerkraut.  Gives me a reason to go back!  You can look for the 1/2 off second entree coupon online  or you can go on Mondays to get the 2-for-1 deal  or there's also a feast for 2 for $29.95 -- or just go anytime if price isn't a big deal.  Entrees all run about $26 but they are enough food for 2 meals!    Overall - great  authentic  hearty food  save a little dough rather than eating at the pricey hotel restaurants on the strip!"
Restaurants;German;Delis,There are few German restaurants in Las Vegas  In fact this is one of two. The other is the Hofbrauhaus which has a completely different goal in mind (attract tourists)  than this more quaint and authentic German restaurant located away from the busy strip and in a small not too flashy shopping center.  The waitress dressed in a dirndle and spoke German  (and English of course) We sat is a private and cozy booth near the kitchen.  The food was authentic and absolutely to die for!  German or not you will love the food at this wonderful restaurant/deli. I ordered the chicken schnizel and although I think it could have easily fed three adults from my one plate  I ate the entire thing by myself and the mashed potatoes too! Everyone else took half of their meals home and I think ate the left overs for two other meals. I was just so good  I couldn't stop!  After dinner we browsed the market side of the shop and bought some other German treats. They also have neat steins and other non food German decor. Es war kostlich!
Restaurants;German;Delis,I've been here dozens of times and this restaurant is one of those where I'll keep returning  if only for the schnitzel on a bun.  Granted  their spaetzle is bland on its own.. all noodles are.. so I like to confound the staff by ordering a size of spaetzle with saurbraten sauce.. so yummy!  I do love the saurbraten meal  but I realized it's the sauce that I love about it mostly.  Their warm potato salad and red cabbage side dishes are always on my order  love them both.  But  back to my schnitzel on a bun.. they only have it on their lunch menu but you can order it any time you want.  As a refugee from Iowa  I grew up on pork tenderloin sandwiches.. this is as close to the Iowa experience as I've found.  You eat it like a burger  and choose your toppings accordingly.  My only complaint is the mustard... as a German restaurant  they only have the brown mustard as an option.  But  mustard aside  it's something that I have to have periodically and only Cafe Heidelberg can fix this craving.  Oh  and my German husband?  Yes  he LOVES this restaurant and absolutely everything on their menu.  :-)
Restaurants;German;Delis,I don't care what people say  the food was incredible. My German native friend recommended the place. It looks a bit mom and pop  which I'm fine with. There are three spaces here; a bar  a store and the restaurant.    me and my bf started with  Bavian Potato Soup - so incredibly good And a bread dumpling soup - amazing.  Then we shared a Combination Plate #3  for $17.00 Hungarian Debreczinger - rather spicy and good.  Bockwurst  - ooo soo so so mouth watering good Knackwurst  - oh so so soft and so good  Our waitress was technically born in Germany but was as american as Apple pie. No biggie  she was sweet and a great hostess!  We bought German Chocolate to take with us  as we were so full.  In writing this review  I realize I have to go back. The food was just that good. And prices were reasonable. Also I found this http://www.citycoups.com/cafeheidleberg.html couple for half off. I'll print it and see if it works. :)
Restaurants;German;Delis,Well  just read all the rave reviews  and wonder if they don't get out much.  My husband and I went to Cafe Heidelberg for the second time tonite  mostly because we had a $20 coupon from Entertainment book  and we were seeing a show at the Riviera which is just down the street.  I didn't really like the place the first time  but that was quite a while ago  so thought we would try it again.  I had cabbage soup to start and hubby had salad.  He said the salad dressing was very good  but my soup was bland.  I added lots of salt and pepper.  I got sauerbraten and he got a combo of wiener schnitzel and some other kind of meat  which he thought was beef.  Potato dumpling was not worth the calories  red cabbage was so vinegary I had to sprinkle a little sugar on it to get it down  and my three skinny slices of pork were very soft and tasted undercooked  except for the gravy  which was pretty good.  We each had 2 German beers  and split an apple strudel for dessert  which was also pretty good  but then the bill came.Total came to almost exactly $100  less the $20 coupon.  This is cafe food  not gourmet  and a very casual atmosphere  definitely not even close to worth $100.  Our server  Clarissa  did a decent job.  Not overly attentive  but got the job done.  But we definitely will NOT be going back.  I'm not crazy about Hofbrauhaus either  but at least they have good beer and fun entertainment.
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Exploring the city's German fare  the BF and I headed over to Cafe Heidelberg the past Friday evening.  Upon entering  the waitress looked at us and then the clock.  I asked if they were closing and she said no  but we had five minutes to order.  (I guess the last seating is definitely at 8 pm.)  Walking past the small market and into the back  we seated ourselves into a quaint little booth.  A bunch of older folks filled the other tables and you get the feeling that this is definitely a family kind of place.  (Hofbrauhaus and Cafe Heidelberg are in two totally different leagues.)  The waitress handed us the menus and a beverage list.  The food menu is very basic  nothing fancy at all.  And the beverage list has a decent variety of beers and wine.    I wanted spatzle  and that's all I cared about.  So I ordered one of the few things that came with spatzle - the Jagerschnitzel ($23)  ""Pork schnitzel lightly battered and smothered in a mushroom   wine and onion sauce.  Paired with red cabbage and spatzel.""  The BF was torn between the Mixed Wurst Plate ($23)  ""Bratwurst  Knackwurst  and Bockwurst.  Served on a bed of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes "" and the Oktoberfest Platter ($25)  ""A classic pork schnitzel and a jumbo Bratwurst paired perfectly with red cabbage and homemade spatzle.""  He chose the former since I already had the pork schnitzel and spatzle in my dish.  As we waited for our entrees  bread and butter arrived with our beverages.  We also took a little walk through the market to check out their German groceries and deli.  A limited choice of food items  but you'll find your herring  spatzel  and sauerkraut available here for home.  My pork schnitzel was covered with dark brown gravy and was quite tender.  Pretty good.  The spatzel was okay  but maybe it's because I prefer it with a creamier sauce instead  like mushroom.  (I think I should have ordered the Kase Spatzle ($16)  ""House recipe German noodles smothered with melted Swiss cheese.  Garnished with tomatoes "" instead.)  The red cabbage was blah  nothing special but the side salad was pretty tasty.    The BF's wurst feast came with a side of mustard sauce for dipping and a huge helping of sauerkraut.  The different wursts were pretty good and the sauerkraut was okay.  (Then again  I think I'm a fan of it on the colder end and crunchy than soggy.)  They were both very generous orders and we had leftovers to go.  We never made it to dessert which was ""Bavarian Apple Strudel with vanilla sauce"" ($7) and ""Black Forest Cherry Cake"" ($5).    Overall  Cafe Heidelberg may probably be more authentic German fare than Hofbrauhaus.  They were recently voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" for ""Other Ethnic Restaurant"" again.  So  if you want your German fix  head on over to Cafe Heidelberg  just don't expect the loud music  crazy games  and the long wait of its competitor.  (I added pics of our dinner in the business profile!)"
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Waitress: ""do u have any coupons?"" me: ""no"" waitress: ""good"".sheesh.  All signs posted and coupon related highlighting on the menu makes me feel like I'm the only one at the restaurant paying full price for normally discount food."
Restaurants;German;Delis,Had lunch after the real lunch hours were over and owner still made us German potato pancakes. I thought she was very nice and food was very good and authentic. Im sure the dinner would be great.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Cute little place! We came here with a restaurant.com coupon. The service was extremely friendly  helpful  and attentive. We ordered to entrees and split a strudel for dessert. The entrees were a bit pricey but the portions were huge. The decor was awesome and really made the atmosphere fun. My favorite part was the store attached to the restaurant (which also sells the wonderful strudel). I will be back for that strudel.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Real old world charm awaits as you open the door to Cafe Heidelberg. Service is friendly  the food is as German as you can possibly get in Las Vegas. Everything is fresh and you can taste the quality and love. Sure it might teeter on the more pricy side with dinner entres between $21-$27  but frequent Gift Certificates from restaurant.com can make the meal prices a real bargain. They also now serve a $4.99 Euro brat  chips and either a beer (Coors unfortunately)  or a soft drink in the side bar area. The decor is very quaint and very old world. A gift shop  small grocery  deli  and a respectable choice of beer in the cooler adds to the charm of this place  even if you just browse. Wine selection is so-so. Oh  and the apple strudel-home made  yummy stuff ya. Oh yeah  it's also a great place to come if you want to loose your wife ;-)
Restaurants;German;Delis,Yummmmm  tastes like home! Kraut is actually cooked an ever so lightly sweet; the way it's meant to be. Not that cold bitter stuff slipped out of a jar. The wurst are wonderful; fatty and flavorful with a skin that snaps and spurts juicy glory down your throat  inviting you to slake your blooming thirst with an icy beer (the spaten is well worthwhile).  The strudel was sweet and hot and ooey gooey and delicious. Salad that came with the meal was meh but tasty; the soups my friends had looked much better.  The atmosphere is pure homey kitsch. Think goofy Wisconsin cheese shack. Octoberfest brauhaus. You're there.   And the true mark of any german cafe in america; you can buy a beer boot. Win.  Love it  will be back soon  and bringing fussy family.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Our usual dining group went to the cafe this week. We ordered a variety of dishes and ate family style. My favorites were the rolled cabbage and the dumplings. The red cabbage and sauerkraut were good  but the potatoes and spatzel were just okay. The wiener schnitzel was over cooked and dry. The desserts were excellent.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Wish I had seen these reviews before going. I will keep it simple. In my opinion this place is a total rip-of as far as the prices charged and the quality/authenticity of the food served. I must say the portions were large  but i guess they have to get rid of the stuff somehow.
Restaurants;German;Delis,This is great German food - without all of the noise and hoopla of the Hofbrauhaus.  My husband is from Germany and this is where we go when he wants a taste of home.  The staff is friendly and helpful  the portions are huge - so go there when you're hungry!
Restaurants;German;Delis,I love German food and always have trouble finding affordable and authentic German fare.  Cafe Heidelberg's menu covers a wide range of food and styles and is also affordable  for those other reviewers complaining about the entree prices I will tell you that as someone who visits many German restaurants an entree cost of $15-$30 is MORE than reasonable. If you are interested in checking out this place I would suggest going to Restaurants.com and catch a gift certificate when they are running specials.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Last night my friends and I went to this German restaurant for the first time. I had read ahead of time that the food was good  but there was a problem with the service. I completely agreed. Two of us ordered the #1 special-Stuffed cabbage roll and pork. It was very good; although next time I would ask for the gravy on the side. It was a little too much for me. The meal came with the potato soup  which was okay. The red cabbage was delicious. I also ordered a side of potato salad that I highly recommend to have them heat up. It was yummy! Finally for dessert we ordered a piece of the strudel. It was so great!  The reason for the 4 stars is because there was only one waitress for the whole place. She was very nice  but kept forgetting things. We never got the rye bread basket .  We will go back with a coupon.
Restaurants;German;Delis,I went here a couple of weeks ago and I really expected it to be a lot better. It's crazy expensive for what you get. And I think the owners/servers could benefit from taking the food handlers permit class again. They brought the wrong dishes out to my boyfriend and I. Without thinking my boyfriend removed the tomatoes (with his fingers) from the sandwich then realized and remembered he didn't order a sandwich. When the server/owner came over to fix the situation my boyfriend apologized that he already touched the tomatoes the server picked them up off the table and as he walked away he put them back on the sandwich!!! Who would ever do such a thing!!! Luckily when he served it to the other table something was still wrong because he ended up taking it back to the kitchen. Needless to say I will not be going back to this restaurant 
Restaurants;German;Delis,I don't understand all the glowing reviews of this place.  The mashed potatoes and gravy were INSTANT and kraut came from a can.  I cannot say enough that for 12.50  someone had better have at least BOILED the potatoes.  Over priced  it deserves to be on Kitchen Nightmares.  Unless we just happed to be there on the one day in their history to have used instant and prepackaged things  I would pass it on by.  Their kitchen has at least 3 microwaves visible from the dining area  and they charge for lunch avg $15 a plate?  No thank you.
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Great German food in a quaint and cozy space. Even though our server was swamped with a table of 12 and appeared to be the only server in the house  service was only a little slow. She recommended a wonderful light German beer  Spaten  which was light  crisp and clean and a great match for our food.    Being there at 6:30 on a Saturday night  we lucked out and were treated to ""live"" entertainment which consisted of a keyboard player wearing some sort of German-esque vest.  It was nice enough background music  but over the course of the evening we were amused by the playlist of Hawaiian  Mexican  and Italian tunes  while seeming to lack any German-esque selections.  Odd.  Our meal started with a basket filled with soft marbled-rye bread  which was very good. Unfortunately it was served with fake butter spread imitation product in those cheap little plastic tubs which added nothing more than a little moisture to the bread. Our soup and salad were both very good  flavorful and tasted fresh.  Cafe Heidelberg's house dressing is a light and creamy dill  which I thought needed a little oomph of flavor  but adding salt and pepper seemed to do the trick.  I ordered the Leberkase entree which is something like German spam ... A combo of pork and veal finely ground and formed into a loaf and baked until it has a crispy crust.  Mine was served in the traditional Biergarten style  pan-fried with 2 eggs over easy on top - super nom nom good! Served with warm German potato salad which was nicely seasoned with dill and onions.  Cold cucumber salad was served on the side  which added a cool and light contrast to my hearty and savory Leberkase.  I also couldn't resist a side of spaetzel (little egg noodle dumplings) with gravy because I am a shameless carb slut.  My BF enjoyed his Jaegerschnitzel entree  which was served with a delicious warm red cabbage side and a generous mound of spaetzel.  While neither of us are German  we both enjoyed Cafe Heidelberg's fare and would recommend it to anyone looking for something different  a little fun  and a lot yummy for lunch or dinner."
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Read all the reviews which included highs and lows but decided to try for myself. Well  I went last night and was not happy with the food. The service was adequate but the ""German"" food was not what I had several times in Germany. The prices were out of touch for the quality of the food. They were comparable to Hofbrauhaus but the quality was inferior."
Restaurants;German;Delis,Achtung dieses Essen ist gut!   Better food than the Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas  It has that HOME feel to it..  -TIME  There was only one waitress but the place was not that busy at the time we arrived  she did take care of us (table of 5) in an expedient manner and kept checking on us from time to time.  -TASTE  It was nicely crafted food  not salty or bland we shared the the Farmer's Plate  The Schnitzel combo  Rinderrouladen and Cabbage rolls and they were all great with that home taste although the breaded pork was slightly dry due to overcooking I still ate it....I usually hate cabbage but here was excellent  I would go back and eat just that because its that good  the red cabbage was superb.  I wont give you a review on each dish because I forgot what was called what.... but I do remember that their pasta was not interesting at all. everything else was great.  -CLEANLINESS  The place was clean as expected  the restaurant sits in an older building and it shows but overall I liked the quaint little hole in the wall place it sits in  request a booth because it seats in a more private area than on the front  the front tables feel like sitting at an old cafe/ truck stop type place.   -THE RUNDOWN  For the experienced and inexperienced palate  this place will bring you home  great service and great food...a bit pricey but worth it. Don't forget to try their many German Beers  they have a good selection.
Restaurants;German;Delis,Meh...not really sure what the hype was. It was decent food  with large portions but nowhere near worth the $100 our bill came to after two beers and two entrees. We both ordered Franziskaner's and I had the classic schnitzel (I can't remember what my husband had).   Everything about this place was average  except for maybe that it's one of the few truly German restaurants in Vegas. The beer selection was great  but I would hope it would be. The red cabbage was yummy  and the potatoes had potential but I don't like onions so I can't really be impartial there.  I don't think I would eat here again...
Restaurants;German;Delis,Okay so this is the best German restaurant I think I've been to so far. It's not in the best part of Vegas but it's so much better than Hoffbrauhaus that it's worth a visit. It's a tiny little restaurant with a market/deli adjacent.  We went for dinner and even though we got there shortly before closing (we didn't know they closed so early)  the waitress was very friendly and happy to serve us. She even let us mill around the market after dinner...no kicking us out so she could rush home.  My husband and I ordered from the Chef's special menu and we each got a different type of schnitzel...ALL of them were fabulous! I also got the stuffed cabbage and that was also quite yummy. The portions were so large we had enough leftover for two more meals! We each also ordered a different soup and mine was so yummy  my preschooler bogarted it and chowed down! I barely got 3 spoonfuls out of it. The red cabbage was delish and the spaetzle was soooo buttery and it practically melted in your mouth! For dessert  we shared the chocolate mousse pie and a homemade apple strudel a la mode. YUMMY!  Needless to say  by the time we left  I felt like a stuffed cabbage.
Restaurants;German;Delis,This is a cool spot if you're looking for a full-on German experience in a low-key setting. There's plenty of kitschy stuff  German decorations  and staff dressed in traditional German garb. We stopped by for lunch on a Sunday. It wasn't crowded at all -- maybe 4 other people in the whole place -- and were seated right away in a booth towards the back. We had our three year old in tow and the waitress even brought us a box full of toys to keep him occupied. Apparently  the owner brings in her kids toys whenever he out grows them and keeps them in the restaurant in case any other kids want to play with them. That's what I call a family-friendly restaurant!  As for the food... well  I know nothing about German food. I opted for the spaetzle ($11) since it seems to be a popular dish. What came to the table was a large plate overflowing with egg noodles  topped with melted Swiss cheese  and surrounded by sliced tomatoes. For an additional $4 sauteed mushrooms and onions were added to it. The serving was large enough for two  maybe even three people. It was a little on the bland side  despite the toppings  but still tasty.  Their beer list and desserts sounded intriguing (especially the apple strudel) so it may be worth a return visit. You can find coupons on line for buy one  get 1/2 off a second entree at http://www.citycoups.com/cafeheidleberg.html.  3.5 Stars
Restaurants;German;Delis,Hello my name is ougole I come from germany 5years now I came here to eat with my wife of 50 years. The food here is terible it cost me a marrige . Me and my beautiful wife came in here to eat and food was bad  when I tasted the food it was so bad that I spated it on the wife  she was so mad she yell and kicked me she scream and yell to go to hell this place cost me 107 plus a marriage.
Restaurants;German;Delis,very cheerful waitress. talk alot. the food is okay.  I never had German food so I can't commend on it. portion is large. I order a sweet beer  forgot the name. it was good!
Restaurants;German;Delis,Went to Cafe Heidelberg for the first time last week for lunch (we have lived here almost 10 years). Was excellent all around. We were stationed in central Germany in the Air Force and found this restaurant be be on par with what we had there. I had the 2 sausage plate. The beer brat was a little plain but very good. Could have used more spice. The red cabbage was outstanding as was the side of spatzle. My wife had the schnitzel which was very good  again could have used a little more spice. My mother-in-law had the liverwurst and said it was outstanding. Service was very friendly and  attentive  but the restaurant only had 2 other tables occupied. It was a little pricey $80 for the 3 of us  but absolutely worth it. Not a place I would go to weekly  but a couple times a month for date night absolutely!!
Restaurants;German;Delis,Let me start by saying i purchased a $25 gift certificate from Restaurants.Com like many others did previous to going to Cafe Heidlberg. And if your thinking about doing the same you might want to read this review to make sure you dont feel duped after you get your bill.  The location of the restaurant is very  much out of the way and in a not so desirable location either but sometimes this is where you get the best food. Walking into the place the staff was very friendly and helpful. I have high expectations of German food from a place i use to frequent back home and this was lacking in a few areas. As the dining room was kind of unwelcoming with the way it was setup with glass cases of countless items on display for sale. I feel like if im paying $30 a plate for dinner that i would like to eat in a dining room at the least  instead i felt like i was sitting in a pawn shop. Lets get to the food split pea soup was tasty  bread dumplings were just ok lacking in flavor a bit  the schnitzel was good no doubt and the spaetzle was just ok. The entire mean was kind of ho hum and nothing to really write home about  although i would have gone back except for what happen when i received my bill.  I did what Restaurants.Com suggests in trying sides  and higher priced dishes because you have your gift certificate. This is where the extra split pea soup and dumplings are ordered which i wouldnt usually do because i already know my portion is going to be huge and fill me up. Most all certificates on Restaurants.Com suggest that anywhere from a 15-20% gratuity is auto added to your bill and i personally am not a fan of this as i should be able to tip my server based on performance and is partially why i even got the Cafe Heidelburg certificate in the first place. So a bill for dinner for two came out to $64 for dinner and two sides and that was AFTER the use of my $25 gift certificate. This was partially because the waitress decided she was going to add 20% for herself regardless if my certificate disclosed that or not. That means that im almost at $90 total bill ($64 + $25= $89) to eat in a pawn shop  and have mediocre food at best. I will not return as this is ridiculous  there are far too many great restaurants where i can have dinner for two for $90 and you feel like it was worth it. $28 dinners for this place? If your even in Seaside  CA go to Stammtisch and enjoy your dinner  service and atmosphere and spend half that. http://www.yelp.com/biz/stammtisch-restaurant-seaside
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Let me start by saying I'm no authentic German food expert at all.  So I don't know how authentic the dishes are.  I like the food pretty well.  Have gone there multiple times.  Love their German potato salad and red cabbage.    That being said  they get only 3 stars because they are way over priced (go during 2 for 1) for ""doctored"" dishes.  I asked if they make the potato salad and cabbage from scratch and was told no  that it would take too much preptime and that the cook ""doctors"" them from premade.  Also our desert was frozen and had to be heated  so not fresh there.  For the prices they ask  they should take the time to prep food from scratch.  But I do still like the taste  they doctor well to me.  Also  our last visit the table clothes under glass top were dirty and our waitress was rudish and rushing us."
Restaurants;German;Delis,Cafe Heidelberg was a diamond. No gem  a diamond. Big  sparkly  good cut and color  and at least two carats. Las Vegas has some of the best dining in the world. One of my favorite spots  a strip club that will remain nameless  employs not one  but two Master Sommeliers. Now  there are not but less than two hundred of them in the world  so why does any one place need two of them? I'm not sure  but only in Vegas will you find such a splurge.  With all that said  sometimes you need to let your hair down. Sometimes it's necessary to leave the glitz behind and just find some good home country  motherland  my Oma made it this way  and her Oma made it that way  and dammit that's the way I want it today kind of food.  Cafe Heidelberg is just that kind of spot. In a strip mall  off the strip  and absolutely perfect. Walk in to the Market and take a right into the Bierstube. It's like walking into the basement Bierstube of some mountainside town in Bavaria. Tapestry on the walls? Yes. Dirndl donned bar wench? Yes! Lederhosen sporting accordion player? Oh yeah!  Sarah and I took the bus here from Bellagio for the adventure  and it didn't take long as it's only a few miles off the strip. But well worth the trip. Our tip: take a cab. But after our short adventure in public transport  the large draft Spatens were welcome  and cold.  We ordered a bit of everything as soon as we saw the food on our neighbor's table. It all looked so good! And with half the guests being regulars and speaking thick native German dialects  we ordered more and more. All of it wonderful. Nothing standing out above anything else.   After singing drinking songs  downing schnapps with John the accordion player  and six beers later  we found ourselves broke (having forgotten our credit cards)  payed what we could of the tab  stiffed the waitress  and hoofed it all the way to the strip (Sarah in heels!)...  Now  looking back  feet all blistered and bloody  what does Sarah say about Cafe Heidelberg? When can we go back she asks!  And this time  we'll bring some extra dough to make up for the shoddy tip we left last summer... oops!
Restaurants;German;Delis,The best and most authentic german restaurant in Las Vegas.  As others have said  it is in a fairly shoddy strip mall off of Sahara  but inside it is great.  A neat little deli and german food products store  with the restaurant attached.  Now  as the years have gone on I believe times  have gotten tougher for this little gem  as I have noticed the portion size has declined and the prices have creeped up.  However  the food is great.  The best schnitzel in town  and friendly staff.  Delicious spaetzle  and some excellent bread dumplings with ham in them.  I enjoy the Swiss schnitzel  which has tomato slices  ham and cheese on top.  Very good  although pretty pricey honestly for what you get  so you have to really just love german food and not mind spending a bit.
Restaurants;German;Delis,"BF and I came here and used a coupon that I had found in the newspaper for a ""Bavarian feast for 2 for $29.95"". Not too shabby. It included potato soup for both of us  this GIANT plate of food  and dessert to share. It was my first time at a German restaurant  so I might not be the best judge. All I know is that everything was pretty tasty! The platter included four brats  two schnitzels  some pork loin  sauerkraut  red cabbage  and spatzle. The bratwurst was the tastiest. Like Teri  I think I like cold  crunchy sauerkraut better than what they served  but I love me any kind of sauerkraut  so it was okay. I also love me mustard  which was provided on the side. The spatzle was very bland  but I thought of it as the rice to balance out all that meat  so that was okay too. I think the best part of it was the variety cos what I love more than anything else when it comes to food is variety. Which is why I'm glad we used the coupon for this giant sampler instead of the $25 restaurant.com certificate BF had.  Our server was an older German lady who was really nice. A little forgetful at times  but in a cute way  not annoying. I'll have to tell you the story of how we tried to make reservations  though. BF had called a couple days before we went to make reservations  and this extremely rude woman answered and hung up right after he said he'd like to make a reservation. Twice. We're not sure why. We were actually scared to even go after the whole ordeal  but thankfully there was no trace of that woman when we were there.  Other than that  we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Cafe Heidelberg. Oh  but I forgot about the bread! They served this marble rye bread that was most definitely store-bought and had been sitting in the fridge before it was served. Now I love me ALL bread  so I don't care if it's store-bought or not. I just wished they could've at least toasted it or something cos it was cold. Meh. That was probably the only thing I could've complained about that night  haha."
Restaurants;German;Delis,My wife is not really sure what the hype was  but I love this place. It has more than decent food  with large portions but nowhere near worth the $100 our bill came to after two beers and two entrees (which is why I knock off that last star).  We both ordered Franziskaner's and my wife had the classic schnitzel while I have an interesting dish of which the name I cannot remember. It was some sort of meat stuffed with something. It was good  I wish I didn't sound like an idiot describing it.   The first time I came  without the wife  I had the farmer's plate and it was EXCELLENT but there was so much food I couldn't even finish it all.  Everything about this place is great. Everything is authentic and made from scratch  and I've had the same waitress both times I've come and she is just great.   The atmosphere is great too  but make sure you go passed the deli and into the actually restaurant area (when you enter the store/deli go left and then right around the corner)  because otherwise you'll miss out on the experience. The beer selection was great  but I would hope it would be. And all of the food is excellent.  I will come here again whenever I get a chance. Too bad it's not a little closer to home (we're in the Northwest).  Either way  definitely go here but beware the prices. They will stack up if you aren't careful.
Restaurants;German;Delis,I used Retaurant.Com certificates to dine here during my most recent trip to Vegas from Fri. March/25th/2011 to Sun. March/27th/2011.  Since this trip is alll about exotic dining experiences more than sightseeing in Vegas  I chose to experiment this authentic German restaurant.  The location was slightly hard to find  but it turned out that the GPS we had didn't pick up the part weather it was from East or West Sahara Ave.  I would recommend calling the restaurant before you start driving out here.  I ordered Combo Plate #1 with a boiled Bockwurst and veggies as sides.  There were too much veggies that I couldn't finish the plate.  I ordered authentic German coffee prior to the main dish because I was up till 5am in the morning the night before coming in  and the waitress highly recommended me trying their German imported coffee which was extremely strong.  However  this coffee DID serve its purpose of helping me stay awake for as long as I can throughout the day to make the day count while having a blast on the Las Vegas strip later.  My friends ordered other combos  and I also brought in another table of 4----everyone loved their authentic German food----yes  various selections of sausages is what they are famous for.  Of course  you can't have German food without beer; one of my friends ordered another imported beer from Germany and enjoyed it.  At the end of the meal  the waitress recommended us trying their dessert----we had the Germman style apple strudel which gave me the sugar rush---that helped me wake up for another several hours before I needed more coffee to continue staying awake!!!  All in all  my 6 friends and I enjoyed our first experience here at Cafel Heidlberg here off the strip in Las Vegas for the first time.  Once again  our theme of the trip was:  exotic food experience  and this happened to be one of them because I hadn't had German food in a long time.    Pls. do try if you are in the mood for something unusual.  The decorations inside this cafe were extremely cute and in authentic German designs which were hard to explain because you had to be there to see  but this Cafe also has their own professional business website which you can find by Yahoo!-ing this restaurant's name.  I'm awaiting pictures from friends' camera to add onto this review.  This was a great awesome first experience for me..... Hope all these details help a great deal!!!
Restaurants;German;Delis,GERMAN FOOD FOR A PRICE =) well the food here was amazing the potato salad was to die for and the main course of  breaded ham which was amazing.....the price was a little crazy but worth it if you want some authentic german food!
Restaurants;German;Delis,"Loved this place a few years back when they had a Chef from the ""Fatherland"" cooking. He was classically trained in Berlin in one of the finest 5 Star Hotels. He then left and they hired everything in between. From a Mexican chef to 'god knows where' from..... Stopped going. Went back a  week ago after hearing the old Chef is back cooking there and.... guess what  the food is back to where it used to be. Portions are big  tasty and even the soups are homemade. Negatives I have is that the management there really ought to update the interior and also stop raising the prices on the same dishes. Sides go for $4 a piece. Very tourist trappy.... If the Chef leaves again  I go where he is going."
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Contractors;Active Life;Swimming Pools,I called many pool service companies trying to get someone to come out to my house to look at my pool pump on a Sunday. Every person I talked to said your pool pump is shot and will need a new pool pump.  I disagree as no one should judge what needs to be done without comming and looking at it first. I found Mott's pool service after all the calls trying to find a reliable pool company. Mott's did not assume anything via the phone said it could be a few things and that Dennis will come take a look at your pool pump.  I do not have a flexable schedule the only day I had available was Sunday.  Not only did they come out on Sunday but also fixed my pool pump in less than one hour and it turned out the pump wasent shot afterall. The rate I was quoted was extreamely good and the service was amazing.  I will be using Mott's for all my pool service needs.
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Contractors;Active Life;Swimming Pools,The thing about owning rental property in other states is that you can't really be sure that your property is being taken care of.  When your rental house has a pool  it's an extra concern.  A previous tenant let the pool go to hell  and you wouldn't believe what it took to get it back right.  Mott's Pool Service saved me from that nightmare  so now I build pool cleaning into the rent  and I trust Mott's to take care of the pool.  It stays clean which makes me happy  and it makes sure the tenants LOVE the place they live.  Mott's has always been reliable and affordable.  Thank you Mott's for saving me a lot of headaches!
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Contractors;Active Life;Swimming Pools,Mott's pool is top notch!  Dennis serviced our pool for 4 years and never missed a beat.  He was there on time  every time.  He also helped us when someone tried to steal our pool equipment (unsuccessful but caused damage) and referred a colleague to correctly make the repairs.  Dennis is responsive  very knowledgeable and an all around good guy!  He has given us his professional opinion on equipment and helped us manage a well balanced pool during the swim season and some of the fall months.
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Contractors;Active Life;Swimming Pools,Fact based review! I paid  and they suddenly just stopped showing up to service my pool. Google search revealed company closed (see photo) discussions with others revealed I wasn't the only person who got ripped off. Yelp is a helpful tool to protect consumers from fly by night scammers. Hire a company that offers a contract  that way you can sue them when they bail on you. The honor system just isnt reliable. Expensive lesson learned. End of story!
Automotive;Auto Repair,Very professional technicians. They know what they are doing. My Tahoe needed a tuneup. I have yet to go to V & V and not them not have do an excellent job.
Automotive;Auto Repair,I have had my vehicles serviced By Don Velasques  owner of V&V  for 16 years. He is honest  fixes problems right the first time  reasonably priced  stands behind his work  works with the customer  repairs done quickly.  There has never been a problem he didn't fix. I highly recommend V & V.  I wish all mechanics and service centers were like V&V.
Automotive;Auto Repair,Very quick and professional. He gave me a quote of one price and it was actually cheaper when finished!!! Will be going back.
Automotive;Auto Repair,Very professional service from these guys. I showed up there at 8.05 and they were courteous  knowledgeable and considerate. The owner? was clean and smart looking and the mechanics also were friendly and actually seemed to care. I would recommend this place. I drove miles to get there and I will make this my main automotive shop. Good stuff! Thanks V&V!
Automotive;Auto Repair,It's a drive to get here but the mechanics here are the only ones I trust. I just drop in and they are always more than happy to have me taken care. I love this shop.
Automotive;Auto Repair,If you have a car   these are the only Folks I trust here in town . They are mechanics with morals . I was in a real bind in 2006   the local Lincoln town car folks gave me a estimate   that a single mom practically had a heart attack over. But then a good Rotary International buddy of mine   gave me V & V 's number   and Since then   I would never go   Any Where Else! Thank You for years of Perfect Service! Always grateful for your kindness.
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,Brian was on time and professional. He cleaned my dryer vent and found 3-4 blockages in it.  He believed it probably had never been cleaned in 40 years. He also found a problem with my dryer's output vent.  This will be helpful if I decide to have it repaired. I recommend him to everyone.  Get your dryer vent cleaned out no fewer than once every 5 years!
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,I needed someone to clean my washer/dryer machine air duct ASAP! I called around and finally got a hold of someone and his name was Brian! He gave me his professional opinion even though it was not a given that I was going to go with his company. I finally decided to go forth and that was 10:15am this morning  called him back and he added me to his schedule and two hours later job was done. He did a great job and I'm very happy with the service he provided.
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,"I've been in my first home two years now and the place was built in '84. I had no doubt my ducts were dirty  but didn't expect anything like what I saw come outta them after using Brian's service.  I was slightly hesitant at first to get my ducts cleaned because I've heard both positive and mixed opinions about it. I decided to go for it regardless. After calling around town and getting some of the most ridiculous over the top prices  I decided on All Ducts Cleaning. Brian is a pretty down to earth  easygoing  easy to talk to  knowledgeable  hard-working guy. I felt confident he knew what he was doing and trusted him moving around inside my home.  He showed me the brand new filter in his machine before starting the process and what it looked like afterwards. Afterward  it was caked thick with dust  dirt  and sentiment between 8 ducts in which Brian climbs up  removes all the air vents  and uses a special rotating tool with brushes going back and forth to break up whatever is inside. From there  everything gets sucked-in one main duct via a high-powered HEPA filtered machine.  He also checks and goes into explaining the different types of air filters to use. Cleans out the area where the air filter goes and finishes off using some type of air ""conditioning"" spray which you can really feel the difference in air quality as it disinfects throughout the home moving through the system.  It's been two weeks so far and I definitely don't sneeze as much as I used to everyday. Will be looking forward to getting the ducts cleaned again in a few years."
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,This was my first time ever having to get my ducts cleaned and I'm glad I with with All Ducts Cleaning. My dad runs his own privately owned company and I know how much more personal he's able to be over big companies and that's what helped me make my decision to go with All Ducts.  Brian was on time and didn't waste any time cleaning my ducts  he even went the extra mile to remove a piece of insulation that would have eventually clogged up my AC blower.  I almost forgot to mention that his services are VERY affordable  I was even surprised at his quote but very happy at the end of it all.
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,Just renovated a 15 yr old fixer upper  and had Brian come & clean all the duct-work this week. Wow! I couldn't believe all the dirt & filth & pet hair & god-knows-what that he pulled out of my house! I am breathing MUCH easier now. Brian was on time  polite and thoughtful about cleaning up after himself  and extremely thorough. Best of all  his rates are better than anyone else's  and iirc he offers a senior discount. Perfect service  will use again and recommend to everybody.
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,Highly recommended. Brian is intelligent  honest  likes cats  and did a great job of cleaning our air ducts! Prompt  friendly  informative. A keeper in our book! Thanks again.
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,Just got my air ducts cleaned by Brian this morning. He did an excellent job  showed me all the filth he sucked up. Cleaned up after himself  was on time & professional. Really nice guy and knowledgeable in what he does. Highly recommend him!
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,Brian is awesome!! He not only was super professional  but also took the time to teach me about what he was doing and how to maintain healthy air!  He's very kind and we are super happy about his work. We did a remodel and there was so much dust everywhere. Plus  we had tenants in the property that left strong cooking odors. Not good since we were now moving into the  house. Now it smells great and we are dust free!  Highly recommend. Thanks Brian! :)
Air Duct Cleaning;Heating & Air Conditioning/HVAC;Home Services;Local Services,My kids' allergies were really kicking up  so I started looking for someone to clean our air ducts.  I called a highly rated air conditioning business to ask their opinion and they told me their customers were extremely happy with All Ducts.  I called Brian (owner/manager/employee) and he got me an appointment exactly when I needed it.  He gave me an estimate for both cost (very affordable  in my opinion) and time and both were spot on. He has all of the right equipment--he is not a carpet cleaner that is trying to moonlight as a duct cleaner. He is thorough and professional.  I had him clean my dryer vent as well  which was a tricky job  as the builder vented the dryer from the first floor to the roof. However  Brian had the proper equipment and was able to do the job easily. I highly recommend All Ducts.
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,I have been following Alt F since I found them at a bridal show in 2008 (when they weren't available for our big day). I knew I would find a reason to work with John and Dalisa. So FINALLY my husband and I had John of Alt F Photography shoot our picture last year and the photos turned out AMAZING! We received so many compliments and have a great print hanging in our home today. Dalisa is very pleasant to work with and John is an amazing artist!  I was a able to get the session last minute and use an on line deal from Wedding Wire. Altf F is a cutting edge photography studio and their space is simply COOL! You will have great pictures  no matter what! I wish they would have been available for our wedding... Great experience!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,Without a doubt  one of the most inventive and artistic photographers you will find anywhere! John and Dalisa are an incredible dynamic duo and their work truly speaks for itself! I've had the opportunity to collaborate with them on several occasions and the images captured are stunning. Plus  they are seriously awesome people... Always friendly and professional!  If you want portraits that look like they came straight from the pages of vogue- Altf is it!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,There aren't enough words to describe how amazing and talented John and Dalisa are! Not only does their work speak volumes about their creativity and ability to bring out the best in what/whomever they photograph - they have the amazing ability to make you feel as if you are their only client!  The personal attention you get as a client is amazing and very special.  We were lucky enough to hire them for our wedding in California and they were such an integral part of our weekend! I absolutely love our wedding (and engagement) photos and had an incredibly hard time whittling down our favorite photos into two beautiful photo albums which to me are like works of art (not because of us - but them of course!)  If you get an opportunity to work with AltF you couldn't imagine not having them as part of your special occasion!  They are the nicest  most professional team you will meet.  Thanks again guys!! XOXO
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,Hands down the best wedding photographer in Vegas and beyond!!  Having John there was one of the best parts of the day and the pictures came out FANTASTIC!!  The work is so far from run of the mill and my wife and I love the work.  Altf is worth every penny.
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,John Michael Cooper & Dalisa Cooper set the standard for wedding photography - not to mention maternity photos  editorial layouts  and art....And they set those standards high!  What I love about working with JMC and the team is that he truly sees the world through a different set of eyes.  Behind his very Zen demeanor is a sharp eye  skilled hands  and a talent at using shadows and light unlike any I have ever seen before.   As a wedding planner I can tell you that they have never disappointed any client or couple.   As a client who has been lucky enough to be photographed by this team I have to tell you...My family & I never looked better! Do not miss the opportunity to work with Alt F ~ You will never regret it!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,John and Dalisa are talented creatives who continuously evolve to stay passionate and provide the best photography art available!  They are not only talented but deeply care about their clients and intuitive about their needs.  I received great artistic shots for my modeling portfolio as well as sweet  beautifully captured images of my precious newborn baby.  Your wedding  your maternity shoot  the first week of your baby's life  can only be captured once. Altf is the right choice.
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,AltF ROCKS!! Unparalleled in photography industry! John Michael and Dalisa Cooper are phenomenal. They are amazing people with true talent and we are now honored to call them our friends. You will never get pictures like these from any other photographer. Truly unique and inspiring!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,There aren't enough stars in this rating scale to give John and Dalisa of Altf an accurate review.  I fell in love with their work when they shot the weddings of two of my best friends.  When I got engaged and started planning my wedding  I knew there was no one else who could do the job.  To make things more interesting  my husband and I planned our wedding in the Bahamas.  It was never a question - we were flying John and Dalisa out to document the weekend.   Our wedding was very intimate with only our closest friends and family.  John and Dalisa are so laid back that they fit right in.  The engagement and wedding shots they took that weekend are beyond words.  The work  and the fun  didn't stop there.  We met with them a couple of times after to review shots and edit our album.  Both times over Champagne...even though we were miles apart.  They are very special people who just happen to do AMAZING work.  Every time I look through my album  it takes me right back.  I have continued to stay in touch and follow their work. I would recommend them to anyone!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,I cannot say enough wonderful things about Altf.  They are the gold standard for wedding photography.  We booked John Michael Cooper and Dalisa Cooper through our wedding planner  Andrea Eppolito  and we are so happy that we did.  John and Dalisa are artists.  They see something that you don't and capture that beauty.  And above all else they are super cool!  They are easy going  communicative  and fun!  My husband is an impatient guy and they had him laughing and making both our engagement shoot and the wedding day pictures fun.  We only just got married  but the couple of pictures we were lucky enough to have a sneak preview of simply blew us away.  I have never felt more beautiful than I did on my wedding day  and when I look at those pictures I feel it all over again.  There aren't enough words to describe how incredible they are!!  Thank you JMC  Dalisa and team for your talent  professionalism  humor  and amazing art!
Photographers;Session Photography;Event Planning & Services,There are photographers who will take pictures and then there are artists with vision who create images of your life moments and events. John and Dalisa are on their game and produce something unique and special. My wife and I feel very fortunate to be able to work with them as the images they present blow us away! You guys are the BEST!!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,passionate and friendly service  delicious healthy food at a very fair price. I'll definitely be back soon!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,I love the fact that there is a raw food place near where I live. the staff is very friendly and helpful as other reviews have pointed out. I would like it better if it was open longer and on wknds. this place is my first and only exposure to raw food restaurant. the food is about what I expected. it was decent. but then again I have nothing to compare to as far as another raw food restaurant. I found it a bit overpriced tho. I mean  they don't have to cook anything.... So why so pricey???
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Raw food express is definitely a place you wanna check out if you're trying to stay healthy. They have a great selection of vegetarian food & juices that are quite healthy. The neat thing about this place is that they let you sample their menu before you purchase their food. Everything is fresh & tastes delicious. The owners are very friendly as well as their chef! The hours for this restaurant are weird but if you catch them while they are open stop in!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"Not Raw  and not Express! The name raw food express is everything this place isn't. The only thing express about it  is that it is expressly slow  and they are expressly dishonest! Raw this place is not! Everyone is raving about Xavier. Sure he is nice to your face  and that is because he is lying to it! Xavier flat out lied to my face about the ingredients in the food. My Ice tea tasted horrible  like chemical store bought processed sugar crap!!!! Crap that I don't drink  for various reasons...blood sugar issues being just one of them. Xavier said the tea was made with lime juice  cinnamon  and hibiscus. The real truth is that it is colored Fresh and Easy Limeade...possibly colored with hibiscus...but I doubt that at this point. We saw them bring in at least 20 bottles of the limeade from the store. We asked Xavier multiple times if it was store bought limeade in the tea  he kept insisting it was fresh squeezed. (This is while we were watching the girl put the limeade in the fridge) He went on to brag about he was creating his own line of teas. We kept insisting that lime juice is not sweet like he was telling us. He just insisted that that is why his line of teas was the best because he ""could do things that others couldn't do"". I believe that ""thing"" is called ""lie"". Or maybe that ""thing"" was buy some Crystal Light and mix it with some limeade. I could do that at home if I wanted to  but I wouldn't because that is NOT HEALTHY!!!!!!!!!!  I don't believe that Xavier eats raw food  or even healthy in general.  If  he did  he would understand why people care about what goes in their bodies and would not lie to them about it. He told one customer that he doesn't eat vegetables  that's why he blends them. What healthy person doesn't eat vegetables??!!!!!!!!! I would not trust the smoothies from this place any way. Probably made from Kool Aid  and canned vegetables or something.  They also don't make the food they sell there. I'm not sure if Chef Sharon makes anything  and if she does  she doesn't make it there. Why else was there a chef there that was talking to xavier about bringing food in to sell? He was clearly not familiar with the raw food concepts.   I had to drive way out of the way to give this place a chance. I really wanted to support a small business  that was promoting health and raw food. I am very disappointed in this place  and very angry that I was lied to!"
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Place is AWESOME! They let you sample EVERYTHING! I think my favorite item is the Sweet lemon pepper Hummus!  Paired with baked sweet potato chips. I also love the pesto quiche!(sp?) My vegetarian boyfriend really enjoyed the mock chicken wraps. We were very impressed with the service Mr Xavier showed us and we were able to meet Chef Shar. It is a family run business and they have a lot of passion for what they do. I'm so glad it is a health-conscious joint and I'm looking forward to new items. :)
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Xavier  the Manager  will turn you on to the raw food movement after tasting his very nutritious smoothie creation.  He convinced me that all i need are vegetables and fruits and maybe some nuts.  It is that simple and it is the way.  This cafe and the people who operate it believe in wellness and giving back to the community.  It is very refreshing and wholesome.  Let's support it.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is Great! If you are. Super indecisive and don't know what to order no worries Xavier will literally let you try a sample of everything! Try the lemon pepper hummus soooo good! And the mock chicken wraps never disappoint.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,So far this is a incredibly tranquil and friendly experience. However I will review as I go. I've ordered a combination plate and have chosen the crab cakes and zucchini wraps with extra artichoke and spinach hummus. .....I am awaiting the arrival of the order and am excited.   Ok so my food has come and it's freaking delicious... End of review..5 stars for this place. Hope it sticks around!!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,I like how you can call your order in and they'll make it fresh for you. I had the Mexican wrap and Lebanese salad and the macaroon that came with all for $10. I really enjoyed the salad and macaroon not so much the wrap but I will definitely be back. The cashier was very friendly and asked if I would to sample anything which was very appealing for me to return to try new items on the menu.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Super friendly family owned business. Great lettuce wraps and healthy smoothies. Excited to see them grow and offer a larger selection of ready to go food!  Xavier is the bomb! Always wanting to educate his patrons and bring a smile to their faces. I've never gone in there and not left without feeling happier than when I went in :)
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,My favorite raw vegan place!! They are so friendly and the food is so wonderfully healthy and delicious.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"I can't say enough great things about this place. I love Raw food express and I can't imagine how anyone could ever have anything bad to say about this place. I have been coming here for over a month now  pretty much on a daily basis. Xavier is awesome! very helpful and can answer any question you have regarding the food and ingredients. I don't believe anything here is ""pricey"" you are getting raw organic fresh ingredients  so yes  you can go to McDonald's and pay 5 dollars for a Big Mac Fries and soda which has no nutritional benefit for you and you are basically putting chemicals and toxins in your body or you can pay 10 dollars for a plate of natural organic ingredients. Quality does cost more and is worth it if you care about what goes into your body. As far as the smoothies/juices there  the great thing about them is Xavier blends the whole foods in the vitamix blender rather than pulverizing and extracting them into a juice  which keeps them from oxidizing as quickly. Thus all the nutrition and fiber is retained and you can buy one and let it sit in your fridge for a few days. I think we definitely need more places like this in Vegas that cater to the Vegan community."
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,I love raw  organic  non GMO food and am constantly only on the hunt for a good place.  However  several things turned me off about this place.  So much so that I will never go back.  I hate giving one star to a place that is not a chain... so I'll just state my experience and let everyone else decide.  First  the attitude of the owner was too intense for lunch and inappropriate.  She sat with us (yep  at our table) nearly the entire time and lectured us about food and how to take care of ourselves.  By the way  I did not seek this advice and I only had an hour for my lunch break.  However  I was polite and entertained her and took her advice  but after 15-20 mins it was no longer welcome.  She stated that people that come to her restaurant are here because they need help.  She was abrasive and pushy with her tone and comments.  I told her we only came for the food  but she insisted that people come because they need guidance.   She continued to preach and offer advice (on what you needed to consume and even how many bowel movements you should have)  so I told her that she should consider changing the name of her place because Express doesn't reflect what her business style was.  She wants a business where she can coach and help others.  As several other yelpers mentioned  she wants you to sample things so you can get a taste for her food  but it is not fast service.  The word express is not reflective of her business at all.  While you're there she tries to lecture you and push her knowledge on you.  Since I love learning I listened  but when I questioned anything (as someone who's studied medicine and nutrition for years would) she was not receptive to my responses.  (Which was actually quite shocking... I felt her rolling her eyes at me)    I think she was very nice when I was just listening  but once I started asked questions (especially about the ingredients in the juice) she because very defense and slightly rude.  We spent over $40 on a meal for 2.  And more when we ordered the hummus. In my opinion price point is too high  but that wouldn't keep me from coming back if I thought it was worth it.    The hummus was ok  but not memorable.  Honestly  I prefer the raw hummus at Whole Foods.  Her desserts were yummy  I will give her credit for that.    Overall  the food was decent  but I am did not like the taste of the juice.  Note:  Its not a raw juice  its an elixir loaded with vitamins and minerals.  The elixir or juice that she has does not say organic and it packed with loads of nutrients that I don't know are necessary for most people to consume.  Its also hard to determine if there can be negative side effects when everything combined.  There isn't an FDA approval system that I know of for supplements  so I stay cautious with them.  Plus  I felt terrible after drinking it so I'll let my body decide on this one.  I believe in raw food  but I wouldn't be comfortable drinking the elixir or juice ever again.    It took me a while to write this review because I wanted to separate my experience from the taste of the food. I don't know if I fully can  but I've never had a craving for the food (not even the dessert)  This isn't a place that I can recommend.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This is probably most welcoming atmosphere I've ever experienced in Vegas  true genuine hospitality and passion for their craft. And on top of that the food is amazing. Every ingredient has a purpose with numerous benefits which Xavier will gladly explain to you. Fresh teas  amazing coffee  and raw vegan food and desserts. Only downfall is they aren't always open when I want to go there  but it's totally understandable.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Food here is ehhh. But the prepackaged food also kinda irked me. I'd rather see the chef prepare it or set my plate after I order it. Out of all the things I tried (sampled: kale salad  chipotle taco  crab cakes  bought: mock chicken wraps  and zucchini wrapped hummus) I only enjoyed the chipotle taco.  the items are really small for the price  and mainly just doesnt taste that good.   Like your mock chicken and crab should taste something like the meat its pretending to be right?   I just felt like a bird eating all those seeds.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,The staff here are super friendly and accommodating. They are happy to answer any questions and offered me a free sample late to help me decide. The curried chickpea salad and broccoli and mushroom salad were wonderful; savory and full of flavor. I had the peanut and coconut macaroons for dessert  and I had to resist the temptation to get a dozen of them boxed up to take home. They also have various juice tonics which I wi have to try in the future.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This chef actually gave me a speech about how there is no scientific evidence that GMO's are unsafe.  This Chef actually wanted to debate with me about O R G A N I C foods.  I walked in and I had 1 simple question.   Do you use O R G A N I C ingredients at all? This was my first and last time I will ever set foot in that place.  He was very cocky and full of pride as he pointed to a machine on the shelf above him... he washes away all the pesticides   said that he ONLY USES  CONVENTIONAL ingredients and doesn't believe in anything  O R G A N I C.  He was very rude.  He talked over me as I explained that conventional vegetables and fruits  etc. have been modified with DNA that modifies DNA in our bodies... didn't even let me finish  instead he continued his speech that it is washed away... YOU CANNOT WASH AWAY MUTANT DNA that was injected in the seeds and the plants to make it frankenfood... SPREAD THE WORD!!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Discovered this little place today and I loved it! Tasty vegan selection and awesome customer service. You can even sample majority of the food if you aren't quite sure on what to order.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,A bit out of the way  to get to if you are visiting on the strip  but if you are a hard-core Raw Foodie  it is worth the drive. the menu is quite limited  but what is there is very well prepared and flavored. I think it's one of the best raw food friendly eateries in the valley. Generally they will offer you a free sample of anything before you buy! That shows they stand behind their food  as they should.  They also have a little shop with a few things to buy.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Very nice.  First time here and at a raw food restaurant.  Loved the enthusiam of Xavier!   Had a good mocha and tried the raw sweets!  Loved the coconut macaroons!   Atmosphere is very relaxing with cool jazz.  Next time will try a raw meal.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Like another reviewer said  I found it really disappointing that they don't use organic/non-GMO products (I did see they have organic lemonade) - not even in their juices/elixirs. I used to come here a lot when my co-workers signed up for a juicing cleanse package they offered.  This is why I don't understand their prices. If you aren't buying organic and non-GMO  why are your prices so high? I could go to Whole Foods and get a custom juice for the same price that IS organic and non-GMO. I'm not going to get into a cost vs health debate here  but I bring this up because I was also told someone that worked here that organic and non-GMO weren't essential to a juice cleanse. Any of the foremost authorities on juicing for health will tell you different: Gerson  Wahls  etc.   To add something nice  Xavier is awesome. He is very friendly and kind. He will let you try everything and thoroughly explain it to you. He always has a welcoming smile and great attitude. I almost feel bad writing this review because I do not want it to reflect on him in any way.   I really really want to like this place. I appreciate what they are trying to do. Overall  the prepared foods all were cool concepts  but really lacked flavor - same for the juices. I didn't care for them at all. And I WOULD be willing to pay more for organic and non-GMO.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Totally agree with everything said before me! I drove from Henderson to get my hair done at Platinum Hair studio (Which was also amazing and got everything i asked for) and while i was waitinf i tried out this place! I was impressed that Xavier was greeting people by thier first name and knew right off the bat i have never been there before! Their were so many options and i really wanted a coffee drink  but passed since i'm trying to whiten my teeth. I asked him just to make me something good  so he made the same drink for me as the lady before and i'm glad he did! Filled with veggies and fruit including califlower and zucchini! Two veggies i usually can't stand!!! I told them my mama would be proud of me for finally eating my veggies! It was deliciousness in a cup ;) Will definitely stop by again when i'm on that side of town!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Loved the mock crab cakes that came with a refreshing celery and corn salad. The crab cakes paired off nicely with a dill dipping sauce.  First timers get half off on tea and smoothies  which was a sweet deal.  The place is pretty small. When I came there was a group of 15 people having a meeting about the benefits of RAW foods and were hogging all the tables. But no worries! There were patio tables that I enjoyed my lunch at. I'd definitely come back again.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is not only not open during business hours but looks like it's shuttered it's doors for good...
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"Hollar!  Love this place  although it is pricey.  A small container of hummus is $7.00.  But the hummus is to die for!  I am happy they added the sign on the side of the building Raw Food Express or I would have never stepped in the door.  The gentleman at the front offered me samples galore.  I basically had a meal just sampling all the food.  They make everything fresh  they only have a few things premade for you to go and pick up.  Everyday they have a new selection of foods to sell THAT DAY.  I tried the ""chicken salad wraps""  of course it was not real chicken but seriously did taste like a chicken salad.  The not so cheesecake was amazing and the coconut pastry puffs were perfection!   Unless you want what they already have in the fridge for that day  you can not go in and order anything off the menu.  You have to call in a day or two ahead and ask them to prepare the food for you.   If you are looking for fresh  vegan and gluten free food this is a great place to go.  Just remember to call in before to see what they have or call in to order your food for the week.   They also serve a large variety of coffee and smoothies.  I did not try any but if it taste anything like the food  then I am sure its fantastic!"
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"The couple who own & work the store are so nice and love what they do. One of them enthusiastically explained to us all of the different ingredients and health benefits/uses for their ""elixirs"" and let us sample all of them. They all tasted like really flavorful juice and were DELICIOUS. You could slightly taste the vitamins as an aftertaste  but my friend and I really didn't mind (according to the owner  they had 100-something different fruits & vegetables and a ton of different vitamins inside). You can mix them any way you want to suit your health needs OR what simply tastes good to you. A refreshing 12oz drink was $6.  I didn't get any food  but I read the menu which looks pretty delicious (ALL VEGAN!). Most importantly  it seems like everything is super affordable. Definitely gotta go back to try the menu."
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"So  my vegetarian friend and I when out for some Thai food when we saw Something's Brewing Coffee House from where we had planned to eat. We noticed the sign also included ""Raw Food Express"" which intrigued us. After ordering  we decided we'd look this place up via Yelp to see the ratings and reviews. To our surprise  both were top notch! We both agreed that after our meal  we'd go check the place out and find something to order. We entered a few minutes shy of 7:00 and were immediately greeted by the manager  Xavier. He asked whether it was our first time  and was extremely informative and helpful in the selection process of what we should order or try. He offered us free samples of several of the treats they had-- the carob peanut butter macaroon was my absolute favorite!   Being that we were stuffed from dinner  we settled for a hot green tea and chai tea  that Xavier had specially made to our liking. He had given us so much information about the business  the term ""raw "" and product information. I felt bad because business hours were over and Xavier was still catering to every need or question that we had. He truly is one who is passionate about the Vegan lifestyle and his business. I can't wait to return! I plan to pay a visit on Friday night  as we were informed later hours. Definitely recommend this place for Vegans and non-Vegans."
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,After meeting the owner or chef and she kept going on and on about how the food was healthier and way more tastefull  I had to give it a try. (I am not vegetarian)   I have to say that the food was full of flavor. I tried this desert of somesort it had nuts in it. I tried the hummus and I have never had hummus before so I was kind of scared.... but it was delicous. Like I just wanted to keep eating and eating.   Next time if I can I will try 1 of everything.. lol jp  I would highly reccomend this place if you just want a snack or something new to try..  :)
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Very good vegan food to go. You can eat there but the space is small. It's more like a pick up food place. The food was great!!! All vegan and great staff. Food is made fresh every day and ready to go when ordered.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"I am so sad that I may be moving back to LA now that I've discovered Raw Food Express  I'm seriously considering living in Vegas ""part-time""...if that even makes sense. Whatever  I'll figure it out.  After reviewing the menu online and having my mind set on the BlackJack 21 Salad  I drove a few blocks down to the Cafe. I was immediately greeted enthusiastically by Xavier and then Rosa took care of my order. When I realized how small the container for the salad was  I was a bit worried that I wouldn't be satisfied. Rosa insisted that it may look small  but the various  nutritious contents will keep my stomach (and brain) happy. However  she also cheerfully gave me samples of a few other items if I wanted to try anything else  just in case.   5 samples later...  Damn. I am definitely coming back for the tacos  mock chicken salad wraps  zucchini wraps  and the macaroons. I ended up taking home the Blackjack 21 and Labenese Salad  both delicious but I can't take my mind off of the taco sample Rosa slipped me...curses! I'll be back.  p.s. You can tell everyone here is very passionate about the raw food lifestyle. Xavier chatted a few customers up  including me  about his own weight loss experience (215lbs to 140lbs I believe he said) by cutting out animal products and including his WoRx smoothies in his diet  and the foundation of the food and philosophy of the place. He is patient with everyone's questions and answers every curious inquiry thoroughly."
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,5stars for sure. I have so much respect for the owners for opening this place! Its awsome. Cute little health &wealth fast food spot. Great vibes in here. I like the chickpea salad & broccoli stirfry. Cant forget to get dessert the macroons are delish. We need places like this everywhere! And in my opinion its not overpriced at all. For 11$ you get a big plate of RAW nutritional delicious FOOD!!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"Chef Xavier is a wonderful ambassador to the world of raw food.  The food is tasty  fresh and delicious.  He recommends going to the cafe website to look at the menu  and calling ahead to place your order  so that it can be ready for you upon arrival.  Or  if you pop in on the spur of the moment  you can select something fresh from the deli case.  For those who want help improving the nutrition in their diet  he offers a smoothie program.  He makes a delicious smoothie called ""The Works"" that contains many different vegetables but tastes absolutely delicious and refreshing."
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"What a great addition to our neighborhood! I stopped by tonight to pick up some dinner on my way home from work. I am vegan and I'm always looking for easy ""on the way home"" options or just new restaurants where I can eat without worry. Just like everyone has said  Xavier is awesome and took his time to explain everything they had made for the day. He also was very happy to have me sample an item I asked about.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and clean  the location is great and everyone was very friendly. I took home Zucchini wraps  Lebanese salad and Apple Sauce.  The zucchini wraps were so flavorful on their own...but with the dipping sauce they serve with it  they were amazing! The Lebanese salad was good  a simple chopped veggie bowl with garbanzo beans and a simple dressing. The Apple sauce....is to die for! I am an apple addict so I'm a little biased but this was a pure apple and cinnamon flavorful finish to my meal.  I will definitely return to Raw Food Express! I hope to see a more permanent fixed menu in the future that I could order from but I also liked the system of them making different dishes each day.  You are a new favorite! Thanks!"
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is amazing and all the food is BOMB! I've never tried anything I didn't like. It's all healthy  guilt free  and surprisingly filling!! The master Chef Xavier is not only sweet and friendly  he makes some kick ass food. I've done several diet programs with him and if you follow his orders they really work!!! He's helped me lose weight and I'm working with him now to continue meeting my health goals. So thankful to have a restaurant like this near me!!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"Stand up and holla!!  This little gem of a place is easy to miss plus the storefront sign is about coffee  and since I don't drink coffee I didn't pay attention. But suddenly on the door appeared recently in tiny letters Raw Food Express. The ""raw"" word is what immediately got my attention.   The atmosphere is very laid back  clean  comfortable  relaxing. They have jazz music lightly playing in the background  and there is free wi-fi and even a couple of laptops that are available for customers to use.   Xavier...what isn't to like about him?? He immediately greeted me with a smile and introduced himself  very polite and informative. He told me all about the food and the smoothies  and gave me some samples of whatever I wanted to try.  Everything is made to order - and you can fax your order in ahead of time to avoid a wait. I sampled the raw zucchini lasagna (AMAZINGLY flavorful)  raw seasoned spicy almonds  and raw fire sun-dried tomato chips. Yum. Yum. YUMMMM!!! SOLD!!!!  I ordered the raw zucchini lasagna and the raw mock chicken salad wraps to go. The mock chicken salad wraps are very interesting... lots of texture and flavor  and sunflower seeds  mmm mmm. I can't really describe what they tasted like but they were not messy at all. I inhaled all three of them in less than 5 minutes.   Other items on their made to order menu include kale salad  lebanese-style layered salad  raw zucchini pasta marinara  artichoke-spinach hummus  raw Spanish gazpacho  raw ""no cheese"" cheesecake..I could go on and on...  I am totally supporting this local business- nice people  quality  flavorful healthy food...great atmosphere. The small portions are all around $8  large portions $11-12 but you are paying for the quality  worth every penny.   Oh  and they have coffee  for those coffee lovers out there. :-)"
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Just tried this place for the first time and I love it! Xavier the owner is wonderful and truly passionate about raw eating. He's so eager to educate each customer that comes in. I love that he lets you sample everything before you decide what you want and if you're eating there he doesn't make you pay until you're done eating. The prices may be higher than some like but it's not whole foods bad. Highly recommend the mock chicken wraps and zucchini wraps :)
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Every now and then I crave something light  refreshing and decidedly un-carnivorous. I've grown up in a household that always has Tahini and Braggs Amino Acid on hand and took tabouleh to school for lunch  so this style of eating isn't foreign to me. What did surprise me was the lack of creativity.  With the raw movement being hugely popular over the last couple of years  I came expect that  by now  the food had gotten a little more.. refined  so to speak; a little more creative. What I found at Raw Food Express was simple  straightforward fare.   I ordered the zucchini wraps which was about all they had left in the cooler for the day. It was about three thin slices of zucchini wrapped around a prettily diced medley of bell peppers  radish and cauliflower. This came with a coconut water  Braggs and Tahini dipping sauce. The wraps themselves were hard to eat as they were falling apart  but the cool crunchiness was welcome after braving the 105 degree weather outside. The sauce was unbalanced. It had a slight creaminess thanks to the Tahini  but mostly it just tasted of the Braggs- salty. For these three little wraps  I paid $10. Color me unimpressed.  The only truly redeeming factor of this place is Xavier  and it seems as though he's no secret. He'll take his time with you and explain everything  making you feel very comfortable. He's fantastic!  Unfortunately  the overall experience was somewhat disappointing as those wraps were something I would have thought to make at home and I was hoping that someone who specializes in eating as a raw vegan everyday would have surprised me with their creativity. Not so. Still  it wasn't terrible. Maybe I'll have to try one of the smoothies  so I don't end up going across the street to satiate my appetite next time.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Great addition to the neighborhood!  Owner was super helpful/friendly and gave the husband and I free samples of all the juices before we purchased.   Tried all the different kinds of hummus and they were great.    Next time going to come hungrier and try the mock chicken.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,If u raw food lover this is for you. I loved the woman that was serving us   so kind and welcoming  They have amazing feature for raw food place  - tasting menu I personally liked chickpea salad and crab cake !
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,"Thanks RFE for stirring up my yummy cup of goodness!  I was brought here with a local who recently found this gem and wanted to fix me up since I'm suffering from a random cold.  Whats up doc  jamaican hibiscus tea and berry citrus greens mixed up together... I highly recommend!  Lots of health benefits with anything you walk out with from here.  Cute couple running the business and very informative.   $6 for what I like to call ""a fix me up in a cup"" :)  If you're into eating clean and healthy... this spot is for you!  I'm a fan! -Miss Yelp 2014"
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is fantastic! Lots of healthy options from a very knowledgable and friendly staff. I highly recommend the Mock Tacos entree and the curried chickpea salad. The Jamaican Hibiscus iced tea is also to die for.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,The zucchini wraps were REALLY good.   They let you taste items before you purchase  which is awesome. The prices are a bit high  but it's all raw food so that's not a big surprise.   The location is small and the checkout process seems like a sales transaction which was kind of annoying but he was still really nice so that made up for it.  I can't decide if I'll go back or not. If I have some extra cash I might because it's a quick way to eat a healthy lunch.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Awesome customer service; very friendly staff. Chef comes out to greet you when you walk in. You can sample anything and everything on the menu before you buy it  so it's hard to have a bad experience. Ordered the tacos  crab cakes  and chocolate coconut drink - filled up two people and tasted out of sight. Will definitely return here and recommend it to others.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is amazing  Xavier is awesome and knows what i like... I get a white choclate raspberry mocha with almond milk  it is soooo yummy  all organic coffee. the customer service is awesome  highly recommend  they make you feel like part of the family  that's how comfortable it is! The food is amazing too  my favorite is the African spicy hummus you got to check this place out! they also offer free samples  how could you say no???
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,I came here right after my workout at LVAC. The customer service was overall good.  I had asked about explanations of the reasons they choose their ingredients but they were all rather vague promoting this whole idea that acidic foods will really mess you up.. When entirely your blood pH never changes that often. I believe they got the idea right just  their reasoning could use more accurate detailed answers. ( I am a Medical Laboratory Technician )  But yes the important thing is the food! There is no meat  I have no problems with that anyways.  I'm surprised at how filled I was from their mock chicken. I thought I had to buy 2 plates the first plate filled me  the last plate I had to force down.  To get an idea of the cost.. For 2 plates and the smoothie it was 28 with tax.  I appreciate how much fiber and flavor the food had. Along with their fresh juice  I sorta wish they made it on the spot instead of refrigerated to get me more nutritional value out of it.  Overall  I like the place its nice  clean  Fast  and healthy. You can pig out with guilt. Lol  Important tip is they open at Noon!!! Grr
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Simply spectacular! The couple that owns the place are just incredibly friendly  they offer a little sample platter FREE because they're so confident about their menu. Every single bite of food on that plate was incredible! The other customer there raved about it telling me all the best items.  She said the food has what other local places are missing...FLAVOR! And se was right! Also  be sure you get their juice! It's amazing!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,Stopped by for the first time and it was great.  The service is friendly and informative  and the food is delicious.  At first  the prices might seem a little high for the amount of food you get (salads are on the small side)   but makes sense given the quality of the food.  TIP: If you're new to the place and have a few extra minutes  let them make you a free sample plate.  It has a bite of everything and is key to having a positive first-time experience  since it allows you to make sure you like the food before ordering.
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is amazing. Food was absolutely great. The service was exceptional! I was able to try an entire sample plate prior to ordering anything. Chef Sharynne Frazer was very descriptive with the menu. Who would have ever thought raw vegan food would be this amazing! I highly recommend this place  and I will be back many times to come!
Special Education;Vegan;Live/Raw Food;Restaurants;Education,This place is absolutely amazing. The quality  taste  and price have hit a home run!!! If you are looking to improve your health with great tasting food this is the place!!! And most of all they do it for the right reasons! I love this place!! You will not be disappointed!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,PLEASE READ... ESPECIALLY THE LIST I WROTE AT THE BOTTOM!! and if you consider... drive around and try to park your car at guest parking (behind the office... and notice all the covered paid parking cars parked are too close to the poles and every car is squeezed in!!!!  In 2 years  I have had my car vandalized twice by key scratches and dents and my car has now been burglarized! I also have noticed random key scratches on other cars too.  I have also had my water that I get delivered.. stolen from my house.    I see late night addicts walking around like zombies on the occasions I come home late or walk my dogs.   The pool is not taken care of and always has people smoking weed and parting late night.. which leads to me saying... definitely NOT a family with kids kind of area!  THE WORSE... THE COMMUNICATION IN THE OFFICE IS HORRIBLE. Unless you actually go inside the office and demand to talk to one of the managers... the front desk girls are just lazy and doesn't relay the message. They just changed ownership... and its been over 4 months and this place is getting worse.  Can't walk anywhere without stepping in dog poop.     This place is a scam for all that they say about it.  You are not safe in this area... which is right across the street to one of the most expensive neighborhood.  LOOKS ARE DECEIVING!!!!!! Everything is OLD... when my refrigerator broke down... they replaced it with a used broken handle refrig. so now it works but i everytime i open the refrig... it breaks off.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE... TAKE YOUR TIME TO FIND A PLACE THAT'S AT LEAST WORTH YOUR MONEY!  Things to look at when you consider this place  1. look at the grounds.... and notice.. not one area has clean grass.   2. ask to see the grills outside 3. look into criminals online... there are 6 in this complex alone (which I only found out a year later after moving in) 4. turn the water faucet on at your place... and try turning the knobs cold to hot while it's on.... you have to use 2 hands  5. MOST IMPORTANT..... DRIVE AROUND AND NOTICE ALL THE CARS AND HOW THEY PARKED. THE POLE IS TOO CLOSE AND THE CARS ARE ANGLED SO THEY DON'T DENT THE DOOR!!!! and try parking at a guest parking (not in front of the office) and notice... how close you are too another car.  AND WAIT UNTIL U WAKE UP AND NOTICE SOMEONE SCRATCH YOUR CAR
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"Be careful. The so-called security deposits are listed as ""fees"" in the rental contract. When I signed the contract  they told me they were refundable and non-refundable deposits.

My $100 refundable deposit and $350 non-refundable deposit were all up-front fees."
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I am still so happy living here!! I had 3 accent walls painted and Sandra Lopez and Keith Knight have communicated with me throughout the entire experience  from the time I asked if it could be done until the day it was completed! Such a great staff  Keith even moved my furniture back for me! Everyone has been awesome and I can't stop bragging about the staff and my experience. Thanks for taking care of me!!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,The Palms at Peccole  Ranch is the best Apt complex !!! Thank you to the office staff  thank - you to Sandra   for always being supportive   helpful  kind  professional  Your Awesome!! and I could always count on you for your help  Pierre thank you for your help and professionalism  maintenance requests were always done on a timely manner  Keith   thank you for always showing up with a smile on your face  your hard working  you do a great job and your a huge asset at the Palms at Peccole Ranch   and Thank you to Ryan  for showing up for any maintenance  and doing a great job  your always professional !! The staff at Peccole ranch make you feel like family  Awesome place to live and I  highly Recommended this pace !!!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I'd also like to point out that Sandra the assistant manager has been the biggest b*tch every time I've ever had to deal with her. One time she argued with me that a package of mine wasn't delivered to the office because when it's delivered its scanned into their system. UPS clearly stated they left it at the front office and that it was signed for. After a couple minutes another employee come walking out of the back with the package and Sandra ran away and hid in her office. She acts like she has such superior. You're an apartment leasing assistant manager  have a better attitude. I will be contacting Waterton corporate to complain.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"This place is great if you like seeing roaches every week. We lived on the second floor and had problems with bees and roaches all the time. Also our A/C broke down probably 25 times during 2 months and they kept ""fixing"" it and it still never worked fine. Apartment designs are also extremely OLD. Carpet is beyond old as well. Had leaks all the time as well that they always come to ""fix"" and it doesn't even last 2 days without breaking again. Also you can hear everything your neighbor does. Definitely a shame for being in such a nice area. Wouldn't recommend or rent to anyone."
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I love Peccole Ranch- great customer customer service - quick turn around time on maintenance - awesome gym and pools - friendly office staff- big props to Laurie Ward!!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I would give zero stars but they make you rate at least a star.  Good luck putting work orders in you would think you see the maintenance men always working outside on the property. It actually takes days maybe a week getting them to your apartment. The pool was shut down by the state earlier this yr. and now I see why. My daughter caught pink eye very bad in both eyes Right after she got out of the big pool one day. Took her straight to doc and that's what it was. Just when we thought it was safe to go back my other child caught pink eye.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,Maintenance man Keith Knight has came into our apartment numerous times for light repairs. He is amazing and very respectful. Our family is very happy with this property. We are sad to go but we've found a home for our expanding family. If you're looking for a home in summerlin we highly recommend you check out Peccole Ranch. Also might I add that we have never ever had a pest problem. One big highlight for me!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"MAINTENANCE TRIED TO WALK OUT WITH MY STUFF. I had got a house 2 months before my lease was up since it was cheaper to pay out the lease than to break it I took my time moving ( I was working 6 days a week on 10 hours shifts). The last week I had the place I came in with my friend and found the maintenance guys in my apartment with the arms full of my stuff. The CLAIMED they assumed I had abandoned the apartment and they where going to ""clean it out"". When I went to the manager and she got all insulted that I would dare accuse them of stealing. If you value your property STAY AWAY!!"
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,My girlfriend and I moved In from out of state here at the palms for almost 3 weeks now. When first arrived driving in from another state 9 hours away we planned on making it before office hours closed that way we could get our keys. Unfortunately we made it 1 hour late and due to being first timers and knowing we were on the way office staff stayed and waited for us to come sign papers and get our keys. We were greeted with such nice and welcoming staff. Signing papers going through all that they made every thing clear . As if they were NOT trying to trick you in any ways for any type of deposit and all that. I signed everything understanding exactly what it meant .   Got our keys came in and I was actually surprised with how nice it was. My girlfriend had picked it out and I never seen it before coming. I was very happy with how nice the carpet and the high ceiling and just how the layout is for an apartment. You can't ask much when moving into a one bedroom apartment and paying what is asked here at Pecole. I think it's actually a pretty good price.   Parking is a little crap if you have a covered one  fair warning to those that come with 2 or more cars. You get one covered parking. The others have to basically first come first serve on the other uncovered spaces.    Great location! We are around some of the best food all on one street and within a couple lights down you'll have everything from a casino to dozens of great restraunts to grocery stores and malls. You don't even have to leave this area at all for anything you got it all within 5 miles and less to you!   We had a couple of things that needed to be fixed. We called the office and again they were very nice and helpful with putting in work orders and getting things done. I called one day and the next day and had someone knocking on the door to come fix it already. I thought that was more than great. He came in and was very nice and had the best attitude. He fixed what was needed except the windows because they needed to make an order for it. We put another work order in for that and 2 days later they were back. Again the second person that was here was very nice and had a good attitude. They did great on fixing things and kept making sure that we were happy with everything and if we weren't they were very consistent on being helpful and great to us.    All in all  The Palms of Pecole Ranch I'm rating 5 star because they are well worth it. I been to many apartments and there's not one that was full of such helpful and great attitude staff. Of course there's little things here and there that you may not like but let's not get too picky now! You get what you pay for. Thanks Palms.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,Fabulous!   Grounds very kept  clean and updated pools ( 2).  Special fenced dog run area.   Unit has updated appliances ( stainless steel)  washer dryer. Bonus.  Carpet 25oz fleck Continuous Filament Nylon.  Bathroom updated modern with dark bamboo strip vinyl. Ceiling fans  mood lighting  vaulted ceilings  and balcony.   All my neighbors are very pleasant  polite and respect everyone's peacefulness.   Complex is spot-on Summerlin with Smith's next door  along with endless restaurant choices.  I've lived here 3 Months coming from California  and so far very impressed  and cost appealing considering I had grown accustomed to California pricing.  The property is freeway close   with the downtown strip about 20 minutes  airport about 20 minutes.   Free wifi in office area.  Gym with modern equipment 24 hrs. As a cycling enthusiast  the roads with little traffic if any   is a cyclist dream along with 11' bike lanes.    The only negative I can think of  is I hate stupid speed bumps   but nothing to over-shadow a great living housing selection.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,Great place!  Location location location!  Close to almost everything you could need!  Groceries within 1.5 miles  restaurants around the corner  etc....
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I enjoyed staying at this apartment complex. It's a quiet community with wonderful amenities and also conveniently located by grocery stores as well as retail shopping centers. The beautiful walking trail in the back provides motivation to get outside and move your body.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"This was one of those 'fun while it lasts' type of apartment complexes for me.  My roommate and I moved here in June  2010 and stayed til July  2011.  We had a 'roommate style' 2-bed/2-bath apartment that was somewhat spacious and pleasant to live in.  Easy to maintain aside from one particular area; the laundry room.  Literally wedged between an area of the kitchen and the fridge  the room was an absolute mess!  Full of dirt and grime and lint that appeared to have been there since the Dark Ages  you just couldn't clean it!  I think even management showed us before we moved in that was ""supposed"" to look that way!  Ugh!  Well  my time of living there was enjoyable...while it lasted as I mentioned earlier.  At times  the apartment complex was fine  no problems  no hassles...but then came a change in personnel at the main office.  The woman who worked there that typically received calls from me was a very heavy smoker and you could hear it in her voice.  She sounded like she just didn't want to talk to anyone and God forbid you tell her there's a problem with your dishwasher  your shower  or your A/C unit.  She just seemed like she couldn't be bothered unless you were coming to give her a rent check.  Also  there were a lot of marijuana smokers in the area as whenever I'd come home from work  it'd be like walking through a heavy thick cloud smelling like a combination of skunk and gasoline.  It also took almost a month for us to get our Internet set up at the place because apparently you could ONLY have specific types of amenities based on special contracts they had set up with companies.  We HAD to have Centurylink for our Internet  we HAD to have Renter's Insurance  we HAD to use the on-site maintenance for control of pests.  God  the amount of times I had to call for roach/spiders/other various creepy crawlers that entered into our place during that year...I finally had enough and purchased a box of insect poison devices to set all throughout corners of the apartment which finally did the trick.  Again  ""fun while it lasts"" was how I described this place and it just wasn't an apartment worthy of enjoyment as much as it was pretty much just there to eat  sleep  bathe...repeat.  I hope that it has ""stepped it up"" a bit since 2011."
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"This review is based on the swimming/gym area & NOT the housing itself.  The parking in the area is very sparse. I had to wander around a few times to find an open uncovered parking. Star removed.   The hot tub is usually lit at night and for some reason it wasn't when I visited one time. Star removed.   Okay  the nice part :]  The pool is pretty big. In fact  there are two pool areas. I visited the ""main gate"" pool  & it's pretty spacious for big groups. Star 1.  I always look to see if there are enough chairs/seats to accomodate for the groups that I'm with. & the chairs were plentiful. Star 2.  The gym isn't an LVAC  but it didn't expect it to be. It serves its purpose. Star 3.  Can someone turn on the lights please? I can't see a thing.. since I don't swim with my glasses on.."
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,This place is HORRIBLE!!!   I lived there for a year and could not wait from day one to get the hell out!  The staff is extremely rude  liars  and do not help you with anything.  I was told if I didn't clean my apt. when I left  I just wouldn't receive my $100 security deposit back.  WRONG!  They charged me an $85 cleaning fee as well as an $80 damage fee when there was no damage caused by us!!  The buildings are old and I could hear every single word from my next-door screaming neighbors and the neighbors who lived above me stomping around all day and night.  The apartments are also very small  poorly set-up  with extremely old appliances that will continuously break down on you or not work at all.  Our apartment had many damages when we first moved in that were impossible to get fixed by the horrific staff and now they want to charge us.  Oh  did I mention that this place is a roach motel?  Ants too.  Do not move here!
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,Just went to look at these love love love em and the location the staff are wonderful.....yey its everything a home should be. Did I say location location wooo its gonna be fun to live here :) Talk about spoiling yaself :)
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,Got burglarized 3 times within a year.  Do you know what the feeling is that every time you go on vacation   you know most likely you will go back home where it has been trashed and broken in? End of the story.    Something is really wrong with this place.
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,"What I really don't like about living in this place is that whenever I go to office and ask maintenance to do some work into my apartment the front office have always said that they will put in a work order and that they will be coming by tomorrow or the next day... But guess what?? That work order I put in was about 7 months ago when we moved in here and yet the only thing maintenance have done was take out my screens n checked out my dryer and that was it and they said that they will come back tomorrow because they didn't have any screens on them.. So that was 7 months ago and yet none of the work orders I've put in still haven't gotten done whatsoever and this was the first day I moved in which was in July... Now it's February and yet still nothing... I actually just gave up on maintenance around here so I basically started doing every maintenance my damn self and said screw the staff here... But what pissed me off most about was.. When my neighbor moved in they automatically have maintenance fixing everything in their place and yet I was just like ""wtf dude what happened to them coming here??"" But oh well we're moving out anyway once the contract ends so I don't have to deal with the constant empty promises given by the front office staff..."
University Housing;Real Estate;Apartments;Home Services,I recently move these apartments. So far everything is been great. Staff are very helpful and nice. The apartment is spacious  modern and clean. The area feels safe. Hope stays the same way.
Jewelry;Accessories;Shopping;Fashion,Consistent with all other Brighton stores although arch varies a little store by store.  Never had a problem with service or exchanges or anything except when I want to browse and have someone overly attentive for my shopping mood
Jewelry;Accessories;Shopping;Fashion,I came because of an offer for a free gift with $100 purchase. Well I bought a $125 gift card but no gift. Can't do it on gift card. I don't get it. You can't refund the card and I gave the my $125. Feeling screwed!!
Jewelry;Accessories;Shopping;Fashion,"I would never purchase from this company again. I bought a purse hook that broke upon the first use. I brought it back to exchange it but was told they would send my broken one out for repair (when all I wanted was a new one exchanged). So they sent it out and said it would be about a week or two since it goes to California. I got it back over a month later when I stopped in to check on it because I never heard anything about it. They had it and gave it back to me. I took it out and looked over it and it came back damaged. The saleswoman said ""I can have it sent out again"" I laughed and said they had already had it for over a month  what's the point if it never gets resolved or comes back in good condition. I am still baffled as to why they couldn't just exchange the piece. Terrible company policies and even worse quality product!"
Auto Repair;Automotive,Very happy every time I bring my car here. It's an Audi and I trust them w it. Very helpful people who care about their customer and are incredibly knowledgeable on foreign cars. Thank you
Auto Repair;Automotive,If you have a European car and want to avoid dealership prices  go to Italy Service. Honest  no extra unnecessary work  they're mechanic takes pride in his work. If you don't know  now you know.   I caused my Maserati Quattroporte engine to seize and Gary was very patient with me cause I could not afford the dealerships labor cost to replace the engine. Gary charged me half of what Towbin quoted and  i kept my car there til i was able to get the money. it took a little long  but it was worth it at the end considering the price and the quality of work I got. Gary just wanted half down  but wasn't a jerk about it. It was like nothing ever happened to my car when I got it back. It was a very big and tedious job!!! They did a very good job.   My baby is purring again like new after being broken down for 8 months. Thanks Gary!
Auto Repair;Automotive,I have been taking my Ferrari 308 GTBi and Lotus Esprit and Porsche 944 Turbo S to Gary for many years and have always been very pleased with the knowledge and expertise of Gary and his first rate mechanics. Every service and repair has been perfect every time. There is no better place in Vegas for exotic  race  sports and specialty cars. I highly recommend Gary and Italy Service.
Auto Repair;Automotive,The area that this shop is in is not upscale. as a matter of fact it's kinda ghetto with flair. When you walk in to Gary's shop you will not see the disheveled atmosphere  or the lack of hi tech lifts etc. What you will see are many  many exotic cars that are entrusted to Gary's care for repair. Now  you can go to Wynn Ferrari and pay 50% more in labor and get raked over the coals by a slick guy from New York  (Service Mgr.)      Gary's honest  down home and very frank approach to exotic car repair is refreshing downright done right. gary KNOWS exotics and his staff  although hodgepodge  are truly geniuses in exotic car repair.      I had a Ferrari 360 Spider that required more attention than most. Every time Gary & co. worked on my Ferrari  I knew it was going to be fixed right. *Just don't expect it to be done quite on time  a small sacrifice considering the money saved alone. Need a part made? Gary can do it. Need wheels  tires or leather repaired  Gary has the connections. Gary and Italy Service will remain an enigma in Las Vegas for quite some time. A little ghetto  a little unkempt  but always spot on for your exotic car repair. Do you want lip service  (Wynn) or real service  (Italy service.) You decide.  PS: I now have a Maserati and Gary has come through again for me on a clutch replacement.
Auto Repair;Automotive,Was very shocked to find out that as a customer that I am a burden for trying to seek service. Very poor interpersonal skills  and the thought that the life you choose as a profession is up to you  but at this shop you get the feeling that their is no time for you  and everything is a hassle. (I would not recommend) taking your vehicle in  so many endless well established shops to use instead. Lessoned learned  but I hope I can save you from the gaggle within this shop.   This shop shows: A  irritating inconvenience (HASTLE)  and needs to remember what the definition of service is (the action of (helping) or doing work for someone)
Real Estate Services;Real Estate;Home Services,If I could afford the rent  you best believe I would be living in Soho!  This place is the epitome of downtown living!  A few friends of mine have places at these lofts.  What I really love is that they have a pub (Lady Sylvia)  a hair salon and a small little grocery store in the same building.  Around the corner is Chicago Joe's Italian restaurant and Brooklyn pizza.  Not to mention the heart of DOWNTOWN just a few blocks away.    All the units here are loft style apartments  open concept with exposed air ducts.  Windows are floor to ceiling and there are really cool cabinets in the kitchen.  The floors are polished concrete and the overall layout just makes you feel like you're in a downtown setting.  Totally my type of living.    I heard the amenities like the pool and workout room is better in Newport lofts across the street.  Also  I'm not too fond of the security downstairs.  Not really welcoming to non-residents.    Like I said  too expensive  however  if I could afford it  I would be there in a heartbeat!
Real Estate Services;Real Estate;Home Services,Built in '05  rooftop pool on the 16th story  spectacular views of the city and in the loft you have floor to ceiling windows with great views of the strip and mountains as well.  Nice little touch is the bathroom window that you can look out of while doing your hair or getting ready.  The 24 hr concierge is a plus too.
Real Estate Services;Real Estate;Home Services,I was looking for a place in Downtown and stumbled across the magnificent Soho Lofts. It was the first place on my list for viewing and after meeting the realtor and taking a tour of it. It was the only place I looked at lol. From the second I walked in it just felt like home. The security at the front is great and the gym and pool are awesome. My kitchen is big and spacious with a lot of cabinet and counter space which is great for me  since I love cooking. My sons room is huge and he has a lot if space to play. My favorite part of my loft is my bathroom with the huge soaking bath with jets. I also like how roomy my vanity area is. The view from my balcony is amazing. I love it here :)  Also there's a great little car called the Lady Slivia that's attached to my building so I don't even have to leave here for a drink :)
Real Estate Services;Real Estate;Home Services,SOHO Lofts is the bomb!!  Anything you want is here.  You don't have to leave this place  except for work  of course.  Lots of amenities.  24 hour concierge.  Very hip.  The view from my lofts is to die for.  The rooftop pool view is even better!!  Regarding Christine B's review:  It's untrue.  The HOA is very strict.  All balconies must be free of ANYTHING that will make the building look trashy.  The rules are strictly enforced.  Your review reads as maybe you were kicked out  or maybe even evicted?!?
Real Estate Services;Real Estate;Home Services,I am so happy that I moved here!  I always wanted to live in a high rise and I believe I made the best decision out of all available inventory by choosing Soho Lofts. Here's all the things I love:  1. Loft style units--very spacious layout.  2. The neighborhood. If you're apprehensive of living downtown  don't be!  The area around the loft is a community. I converse with wonderful  friendly people from all walks of life everyday while walking the dog. They have enriched my life!  It's much more fulfilling than my suburban neighborhood was. It's also conveniently located to freeways and tons of food choices.  3.  The view  of course. Downtown is definitely the best way to face. You get views of wedding chapels down below  parades  the memorizing city hall building  and the sunrise!   4.  The staff. I love all the guys at the front desk. They are incredibly nice and attentive. It's great to have those smiling faces greet you after a long day at work.  5.  The rooftop pool!  Not many high rise residences have a pool on the roof. It's never been crowded when I visit it. I frequently have it all to myself.  6.  The neighbors. It's really quiet considering the location. Everyone is really welcoming and neighborly.   I'm writing this laying in a hammock on my balcony and I just felt the urge to share my happiness!
Restaurants;Fast Food,The food was very bland and overpriced. Don't eat here! (3/7/12)
Restaurants;Fast Food,For a quick and filling food option in the airport this was a great choice for me.  I got the Grilled Wahoo Fish Burrito Bowl with guacamole.  It was filling  fresh and delicious.  It took a little longer because the grilled the fish fresh for me - which I did not mind waiting the extra 3 minutes for.  Staff was nice and quick as well.  This is a small stand - no seating available here.  But I just took my food to the gate and ate while waiting to board.  There is also a Mrs. Fields Cookies right next door - so I might have also gotten a cookie as well.
Restaurants;Fast Food,I had the Pork carnita build my own burrito for my first meal at Baja. It turned out very good for me. Im a bit pickier when it comes to Mexican food ( with the last name being Hernandez I know Mexican food.)   The rice was impressive since most places use a basic white rice to fill burritos. This one used a tomato sauce infused rice  just like mom and Grandma make so I was quite pleased. The kept it pretty simple  Carnitas  rice  beans  sour cream and a few veggies  stuff I grew up on so I will be def going back.
Restaurants;Fast Food,The best food option in the airport. I had the Baja burrito which tasted fine. Better than burger King. You get chips too but you must ask for the salsa.
Restaurants;Fast Food,"Slick & quick.  I only had a taco & a churro  but both were just fine for an ""on the go"" snackfest..."
Restaurants;Fast Food,It's airport food  but i was hoping Baja Fresh would taste like it did outside of the airport. I got the chicken burrito special and it tasted fresh  but was pretty bland. I probably should've gotten some hot sauce or something to give it some flavor. Now that I think of it...they didn't even offer me any salsa or anything! Boo.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Foods good but the employees aren't too friendly.
Restaurants;Fast Food,My flight had been delayed and I was so hungry because I woke up late and didnt get top eat breakfast. I walked around the airport and spotted Baja Fresh. I thought sure I''ll give this place a try other people are sp it must be decent. The best breakfast burrito I have ever had. I didnt even remember that there was no meat in it because the flavour was just so good. Everytime I spot a Baja Fresh in an airport thats where I'm having breakfast from now on. 1 star off because the churro they have me was hard as a rock.
Restaurants;Fast Food,"For being an eatery option in an airport this Baja is not bad by any means. It's definitely a better option than the hot dog place next door. So if you're going through D gates  this is a decent place to stop.  For me the service was decent  but I'm also an airport employee. Discounts  holla!  I had two chicken soft ""Americano"" tacos. Normally I'd opt for corn tortillas  but for some reason this Baja uses flour on tacos that are ""Americano"". The corn tortilla tacos come with disgusting cilantro. Oh how I hate cilantro.  Overall  not a bad place for a Baja Fresh in an airport."
Restaurants;Fast Food,"I'm completely stunned... Great Fish Tacos in an Airport?  I was starving as I got off the plane in Las Vegas to attend a conference.  Nothing looked great to me until I saw Baja Fresh.  I was going to grab a quick salad when I noticed that they had ono fish tacos.  I love fish tacos so much that I was willing to risk a bad experience just to see if I could get a decent one.  Boy was I stunned when I found out that Baja Fresh has awesome fish tacos.  Served on two ""doubled up"" soft corn tortillas  with melted cheese  lettuce  avocado  and delicious lightly seasoned grilled ono  these were outstanding.  My only regret is that I did not get the triple instead of wimping out and getting the double.  The tacos came with rice and beans but I hardly noticed because the tacos were all I cared about.  I'm still in shock 24 hours later."
Restaurants;Fast Food,After sadly leaving Vegas ;( early morning hours the only food places that were open was Burger King...gross! And Starbucks! But unfortunately I didn't think about having one of their breakfast sandwiches until after I got my coffee. After looking behind me though the line was just too long to wait...Again. Sooo I proceeded on to Baja Fresh. Something told me to continue on past them. As it was there was no Welcome anything...aka Good morning; Can I take your order? Nothing! I just got this side ways look from the lady behind the counter like  Ok  I'm ready whenever you are!? My tragic unfortunate experience of their tasteless Huervos Rancheros burrito for like $11 bucks was you guessed it...Disgusting!!! Everything about it was luke warm & nasty! The cheese wasn't melted nor were their potatoes cooked. It felt like I was chomping on beef jerky. Even the flour tortilla was rubbery!? All in all I was better off waiting in that long ass line back @ Starbucks...moral of the story.
Restaurants;Fast Food,This Baja Fresh.... WAS NOT GOOD....  Only had whole beans at 5:30 pm????  Airport restaraunts are usually sub-par but this was BLAH.
Restaurants;Fast Food,I guess you can't expect much from airport dining. If you HAVE to eat  this place is fine  I guess. Certainly nothing to brag about. It wasn't enjoyable or satisfying; it was just ... there.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Like most airport fast food this place is no different. Ordered a two shrimp taco combo  and they gave me two chicken tacos with nothing else. I found out when I walked to my gate so I ate it anyways  the chicken was dry and nasty. Watch what they make you!
Restaurants;Fast Food,Heard of Food Safety?  Anyone?  I don't think the staff from this Baja Fresh have...  The staff making the burrito for the lady ahead of me accidentally dropped some ingredients on the floor.  One of the staff quickly grabbed a broom  and everyone came out to help remove the rubber mats off the floor while she sweeps.  Ok  so far  yes?  Well  it's about to get gross.  After sweeping and the rubber floor mats put back into place  I did not see any of the staff wash their hands or replaced the gloves that was used to handle the food earlier and the rubber floor mats.  Ok  here's the kicker...  The staff who was cooking the beef inside said to the other staff  not to worry about it.  She'd only do it if someone saw it.  Do what?  Like  wash your hands and replace them white gloves that's used to handle the food that you serve to people?  Oh  ok then...  check please!  That's just McNasty!
Restaurants;Fast Food,I had one grilled fish taco and one crispy fish taco. They cooked them fresh for me. I thought they were a little small for what you paid but it is airport pricing. ID definitely recommend the grilled over the crispy.
Restaurants;Fast Food,"When I was in Las Vegas two weeks ago  on my way home  I caught an early Hawaiian Airlines flight.  Rushing out of my hotel  & returning the rental car  I did not have anytime to eat anything in the wee morning hours........  Lucky for me  the McCarran Airport's new Terminal 3 has a whole bunch of places to eat & shop .........they even have slot machines  so you can do some last minute gambling! Lol!!!  After checking in at Hawaiian Airlines  passing the TSA screening area  catching the monorail to Terminal 3.........it was time to sit down  relax  & get something to eat before I board my flight home.  After walking around Terminal 3  I found this place called Baja Fresh ""Express"" Mexican Grill. It was a good place I could grab something quick..........food was edible  but of course nothing like I would get at a restaurant. But the convenience factor was spot on!  Ordered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's & two soda's.............aaaah  breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know  the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor  and probably the vendor's high rent  & taxes.  The food......well  the breakfast burrito was quite BIG  it was loaded with eggs  potatoes  & one type of meat. I ended up taking bacon for my meat. Everything about the breakfast burrito was okay  with the exception of the bacon which was kinda soggy & rubbery. If they had cooked the bacon to a crisp  then loaded it in the burrito  I'm sure it would have tasted a little better......but what do you expect for airport food????  It's all about convenience folks!"
Restaurants;Fast Food,"Fresh may be a bit of an overstatement. I got a veggie burrito which at most places cant be screwed up. Out of all my burrito experience  this as at the bottom.   The rice was mushy and not ricey. The ""hot"" salsa had a nonexistent flavor and the whole thing was a floppy disappointment. I should have remembered the Quizno's around the corner.  Maybe  if you are super hung over and all you need is a bad burrito  give it a shot. I (for any state I am in) will choose a delicious veggie sandwich from Quizno's instead."
Restaurants;Fast Food,it was good. service was quick. the lady making the food was very efficient. not even writing anything down. i got the Baja special or whatever it was. it was decent. i wished they had a salsa bar though. i like their salsa bars. the food didn't give me any food poisoning so that's always a plus. had we known beforehand our flight was going to cancel  we may have just held of from eating here. but  at the time it was good. oh  and we were way too lazy and my feet hurt too much to walk over to popeyes.
Restaurants;Fast Food,"My first stop in Vegas the Baja Fresh in terminal D.  Why I thought it would be a good idea to take a cross country plane ride without any snacks  I'll never know.  Desperate to get my blood sugar up and thankful to be off the plane  I made a pit stop for a chicken burrito. I'm not familiar with the Baja Fresh chain  but this place wasn't bad.  The burrito was standard - rice and beans  grilled chicken  lettuce  tomato and cheese... I was disappointed that there wasn't any salsa or guac  but I don't think I really tasted it going down anyway. Also - I'm not sure if this is a west coast burrito thing  but on the east coast we have steamed tortillas not grilled.  The grilled was interesting and gave it a nice crispness  but it didn't really say ""burrito"" to me -- it was more a burrito wrap."
Restaurants;Fast Food,Passed through the airport just in time while breakfast was still being served.  Favorite for me is the Breakfast Burrito (Bare style: no tortilla wrap). Lots of eggs  choice of meat (some awesome bacon for me) and whatever else you like on top. Love the black beans  Pico  hot salsa and even some mild  sweet onion. Delicious.
Restaurants;Fast Food,"I walked up to Baja Fresh Express in Terminal D at 7am on a Monday morning. It was clean and there was one dude behind the counter. Being a daring eater  I grunt out my order: ""Breakfast burrito  no meat."" He says ""Do you want papas (like on the menu) or do you want eggs  pico de gallo  beans and cheese?"" I was all like 'yeah whatever you just said I want the second one."" Homeboy totally hooked it up.  The tortilla was so huge the thing was triple wrapped. A couple hours later  I was floating home over the clouds in a burrito coma. Damn that place is absolutely clutch."
Restaurants;Fast Food,I had breakfast here. The burrito was big and good (could have used a little more meat filler). I also had a churro which was excellent. As you can expect it is airport pricing.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Decent food to grab and go.   Had one of those exceptionally slow and indecisive guys in front of me and the lady working there was great about ushering him along and getting to me asap.  The food is just ok - but hey  it's fast food. Salads are pretty big though  which is great!
Restaurants;Fast Food,"After 8 hours of traveling this was a site for sore eyes...I had to eat here because corporate Baja closed all of the Chicagoland locations...I needed me a Chicken Baja Burritto.    It was good not great...I am use to the guy cooking in the back and me waiting 10 minutes for my food...this place is more of an assembly line and I understand that because speed of food is important when trying to catch your flight. It did take me 10 minutes to pay...owner kept yelling in back for an employee to ring me up.  I also heard owner on the phone talking to somebody  he said  ""you need to pick this up...I serve fresh chicken not frozen!"". Good to know that I was probably eating the frozen stuff.   The green salsa was also very neon in color. It tasted good but was not there normal green salsa...I think he gave me the verde salad dressing.  I still poured it on...yum!!!  What a way to start out Vegas for breakfast...I feel like a winner already!!!"
Restaurants;Fast Food,Definitely the best kept secret of terminal D  food-wise. Normally I'm not a fan of big chains - especially in airports. My past experiences with local Baja Sols have been all but pleasant  but given my options in LAS  Baja Sol is a winner.  For $6 you can grab a veggie-filled burrito that's semi-healthy  and surprisingly filling - get out!  Before we ventured into terminal D the food court options didn't include any item less than $9! And that was for a greasy  fat-filled grilled cheese.  If you ask me  this was a steal for decent airport food. And you know as well as I do  decent airport food (for a reasonable cost!!) is incredibly hard to come by.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Preface- this is at the airport. This was probably one of the most ridiculous restaurant experiences I've ever had  and I try to generally be optimistic. There were five people behind the counter preparing subway style. Ordering was confusing to the guy taking orders  the next guy was in training or just didn't know english at all  cause the next guy was trying to run the whole operation and also explain in spanish instructions for everything. So there was some fumbling and confusion. There was a presumable manager just standing behind them  never said a word and didn't lift a finger. Workers were obviously stressed and people in line were frustrated. Food was mediocre  but still seemed like the best option considering the alternatives.
Restaurants;Fast Food,A solid food option in D concourse of the terminal 3. You see ladies and gentlemen  on cross-country flights they don't serve food like they used to. The food to buy on board is not very good so come prepared. My recommendation is either head to a casino buffet before you hit the airport of buy something to take on board as that transcontinental back to the E coast is looong.   This Baja fresh is a good option. Burritos are filling and give a good amount of relatively healthy food that should keep your tummy happy while in air.  There was a small lineup but they were organized  took my order and my food came out within five minutes in a takeout bag.  I had selected the chicken Baja burrito w guac. It was fresh decent filling and good size. Ingredients seemed healthy and a bit of Mexican seasoning. Overall it was a solid 3.5/5.  Price for value was adequate.
Restaurants;Fast Food,I love their food and quick service. Everything was fresh about them. We ordered grilled chicken burrito and grilled chicken quesedilla. They were delicious !
Restaurants;Fast Food,Worked for me! It is Baja Fresh and it is nice to have a quick burrito made your way while you are waiting for a flight. The real problem  however  is there really is no where to sit down and enjoy the meal. All of the seating I saw in the general area was specific to the establishments it was attached to. There were some standing tables nearby but come on -- so very close to completely travel friendly and very far away. LAS needs to change this!
Restaurants;Fast Food,Tasteless burrito. I'm not picky  but the food is not good. The 2nd star is only because the Churro is quite good.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Had the breakfast burrito here. It was decent. Not much to say about this place. The burrito wasnr exceptional at the same time it wasnt terrible.
Restaurants;Fast Food,Get a burrito and a soda. Stroll over to the huge glass windows on the left. Find a seat  theres plenty of 'em. Then watch planes land before yours takes off.  Super chill!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love it here  too!! What a great park. I wish I lived closer to this park so I could've come here everyday to get fresh air. You are lucky if you live close to this park. When I bring my dog here  he doesn't stop barking for some reason (maybe too excited?!)  so I like to come here myself to power walk. I like this park better than Sunset park because of a lot of grass area.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I go here all the time because I live close. I really love how safe and clean this park is.  The only reason why I did not give it five stars is...there needs to be a huge dog park here!   If you run up and down the mountain you must become familiar with how loose the rocks are or are not. I would just use common sense. If you are not familiar with that sort of terrain or you are not wearing the correct shoes. Don't do it. I state this because I have seen quite a few people wipe out/fall and that result is not a pretty sight to see.  I love the loop around to run or walk. They keep the middle grass perfectly green and landscaped and my doggies love to roll around in it ('on leash only' dogs are allowed) I have taken a blanket and spent many afternoons reading books in the grass. It is very nice and the park during the week during the day is never busy.  I don't have children but I know there is an AMAZING play area and equipment for children. It also includes areas where children can crawl into tubes and they go underground  odd but true. I was almost tempted to do it myself  but knowing my luck my almost six foot body would get stuck in one........  There are some children's water feature that my friend's kids love to run through over and over again. Again I should try that also because it looks super fun on our hot days.  Security is on bike and foot 24/7 and the guys are super nice. I know they are nice because they have handed me newsletters about upcoming events before. One guys actually carries dog biscuits and talks about how much he loves dogs.   Grab a book  a blanket  your dog  your kid.......just take yourself to EP. It's a lovely park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Hands down the best park that I've been! Awesome place for a family picnic or playing with your dog! You can also hike or you can go jogging around the park trail! The grass is so green and very lush.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Looking at this park compared to the ones I grew up playing in  HUGE difference. I'm used to big metal jungle gyms with lead paint peeling off and rust building up on the stairs going up to the slides. This park is far from that. Wooden jungle gyms that are perfectly built are what this park has. It pretty much looks like a little wooden city. Super cute! If I had kids  I'd definitely take them here.   As for the hill overlooking the city  not a difficult climb at all. Came here to clear my mind and to get some exercise. There were lots of loose rocks up the trail so just be careful where you step. Once at the top  the view is amazing. There's a circular area to rest and glance over the city. Perfect place for date night or just to come and relax.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I've been to this park a few times and for different purposes. Most of the time it's to bring my friends' children while I'm babysitting. I love the large playground area and the variety of activities available. I also totally dig the western theme. I've been here a couple times for family photo shoots. There's a large grassy area and the small ""Mountain"" provides a cool dessert backdrop. This park is also great for exercise. Ruben and I have been here to walk around and to climb that ""Mountain."" The climb is much too steep for my liking plus the lack of a real path and loose dirt made it very unstable. Not my kind of exercise. The top was a really cool though - great view  fun facts  and a place to just chill for a bit. I think this is a great park to bring your kids  have picnics  and walk around."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My favorite park in Vegas! Aside from the fact that it's the closest to me  I LOVE all the green here (out on the ground floor) and there's a hill that you can hike up and work out your lazy selves (like me).  It's also a good place for kids with the playground and it's really nice to just have a stroll here and just talk with your friends.   The view is also nice at the top.. especially at night when Vegas is alit with the Strip's lights.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Awesome park! Great area  well maintained  water splash pad for the kids  everything is clean. Has a little trail to go up and dog friendly! The area for kids to play on are different a must to do!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is pretty awesome and we didn't even take the hike up to the peak.  The playground is a cut above the standard fare found in other parks. I like that there's a variety of picnic table options  small  large  covered  uncovered  by the grass  or near the playgrounds  you name it. The areas around the playground also has two large covered areas  so it's more lively with kids and large parties. A great place to people watch and relax. The lawn area is large and meandering  with just enough elevation change to make the views interesting. If you walk out a little further  there are quieter spots for a more private picnicking experience.  My only gripe is that you can't get into the one and only parking lot going southbound on Buffalo  so we always have to make a U-turn. Oh  and there's an ugly cell tower nearby.  Overall though  a very well thought out and well designed park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,We've been here a few times. The park play area is a Wild West theme and has some hidden slides and stuff around. The water area is pretty limited on stuff to do other then getting wet from a huge bucket.  They have a lot of trails around it and the mountain to hike up which is cool.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This was a wonderful treat that I was told about from a local.    This is a nice little park with a little of everything for everyone. There is a water play place for kids  swing sets  slides and a large play area for kids only. There is also a large park for playing sports  picnics  flying a kite or just taking a walk.  Speaking of walking  there are paved walking/running paths and also a nice 3/4 mile walk up to the top of one of their mini mountains with rest stops along the way.  The views up there are amazing.   The park is very dog friendly and also has restrooms  picnic tables and plenty of lush scenery and views.  The best part of all of this?   Nothing. What do I mean??  It costs nothing to enjoy this wonderful park!   If your visiting Vegas and lucky enough to find this park on Yelp  be sure to stop by and take a walk.  An hour or so would be the minimum I would plan if you want to hike the mountain and get a decent walk around the park.   Enjoy!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I hike this mountain approximately 4-6 times every week. It is my favorite! It's never crowded  and starting from the very bottom of the mountain all the way up to the top and back down the same path is probably almost equivalent to 1 mile. If you're into cardio & running  this is the perfect little mountain to utilize :-)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is a great park!  We took our 6 year old here in the afternoon prior to the red-eye back to the east coast.  She had a blast  and we had a moment to enjoy the warm weather and the only patch of green we saw in 6 days.  The equipment is new  the grounds were clean (a few empty water bottles laying around)  and they have active security.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love this place. As being told in other reviews  this place has a an awesome western-themed playground for kids  great hiking trails and beautiful lawns. The disadvantage in my opinion is the fact that in hot summer days there's hardly any shade! I wish there was some kind if shade on the grass. That would make this place absolutely perfect!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is by far one of the nicest parks in all of Vegas. Its a bit of a drive from my house but worth it. I have been here many times now on playdates and its never very crowded during the week. There are many different areas for the kiddos to play at. They even have an area that you can dig up bones. This would be a great park to have a birthday party since there are several covered cabanas.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,You cannot fly drones here. My husband went once and the security guard actuality flew the drone with him. The next time we came a new security guard said they are not allowed at that park. My kids love this park though. So glad it's so close to home
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Beautiful Park! Well maintained  nice playground  nice trail  huge grassy area  great running trail and it also has a fun water splash pad!! Great place for all ages.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"It's impossible to give this park less than four stars because the lawn is the lushest thing you'll find in Vegas outside of a bar  and the playground is crazy cool.  The playground looks like a western town  complete with a stagecoach. It's surrounded by that spongy playground material and wood chips so kids won't get hurt. When I was a kid  there was a western themed park with a full sized stagecoach back home in Tulsa. Unfortunately  drunks and bums used to sleep on the toys so my parents rarely took me there to play. It's too bad that I didn't have a park like this one growing up  because I would have never left.  I came here specifically to hike up what I call ""garbage mountain"" because before I knew it was a park  I assumed it was an old landfill that was covered up. From Blue Diamond Rd.  you can't see the park  just this strange hill with people hiking to the top. Apart from a few weird dead ends and an inordinate amount of broken bottles strewn off trails (I guess drunks are just really attracted to western themed parks  regardless of location) it's an okay trail.   I'll agree with other posters that it's difficult to get into this park if you're turning onto Buffalo from Blue Diamond  heading south. Really poor  illogical median planning. Also  during the warmer months  there are more cars parked on the street than you can shake a stick at."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Exploration park is a favorite of mine! I hike the hill on the weekends  awesome booty and leg workout. Be careful of you do not have good balance as the walk/hike is uphill the whole way and I've seen a few stumble on the way down. Great look out point from the top! There's a great little sitting/ viewing area at the top as well. Clean park!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"One look at the playground will make any adult jealous. The old western theme jungle gym is phenomenal. As an ""adult""  I was ready to climb up  on  and through all of the fancy equipment. Sadly  it is always too busy. Reminiscing about the past; this puts the swings that got too hot to sit on in the summer and the slides that would burn you as you went down to shame. Instead of feeling happy for the younger generations  I find that I envy them.  The park has nice clean paths that are pet friendly. Every so often there are litter bags and trashcans to dispose of pet waste. Please do not leave your pet's ""gifts"" around when they conveniently place these amenities there.   The best part about Exploration Park is the view of Vegas from the top of the mountain. It is not strenuous  fifteen minutes at a leisurely pace. If you take a casual stroll up  you can see the strip and how spread out our city is. They have a deck and two picnic tables. When the weather is nice  it is wonderful to pack a lunch and eat while enjoying the view."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Amazing park! I live right down the road from here and go here often! There is a great old western themed playground  lots of open grass  trail  and you can hike up to the top of the mountain for an amazing view of Strip and the whole city. I used to run bootcamps here because of the amazing area. Green grass  nice trees  and awesome scenery! Can't ask for much more.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love living in Mountains Edge. I love all of the the community activities held at the Exploration Park. I can't wait to have kids so  I can bring them to the park and be able to enjoy it even more!! :)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Awesome place to kinda cool off with the water sprayers in the hot vegas heat.  Lots of slides and grass for the kiddies to run around on.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Enjoy this park & the trails on the hill. My dogs love running through all the grass. I like that security is always around so you always feel safe.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My kids and I love this park   we always have tons of fun it has suxh a cute theme. When I am not taking the Kids I am going there for a hike up the mountain. Vlean and friendly park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,No dog park! Really... The nicest dog park in town... 2 minutes down the road and I have to drive 25 minutes daily to Desert Breeze! Love that park! But...  What a WASTE! Not to mention the rules and security telling me to keep my dog on a Leash! I have a Golden Retriever! He needs to play fetch and RETRIEVE!   So I told security to fetch my ball... But he didn't like that... EH!! Perfect park! Build a fenced in area like Desert Breeze and its 5 STARS all day!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great location to spend a few hours in the morning on a sunny weekend. Tip - make sure to walk around the park and check out the grassy knoll area before settling on a location.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Nice park to bring your children and dog. Great view from the top and huge area of green grass. Many activities to do here with the whole family.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"Exploration Park is a wonderful little gem on the southwest side of the valley!  The park has many of the standard park features in Vegas...a real nice old west themed kids playground  some open grass  a few covered picnic areas  restroom facilities  etc.  The real ""high point"" for this park though is the short trail to the top of Exploration Peak.    The trail to the top is a well-maintained dirt path.  The short  though slightly steep  hike allows for some atypical  scenic views of the city.  The trail is ideal for families  beginner hikers that don't mind a bit of elevation gain (about 800 feet)  and trail runners.  The shortest version is about 1/2 mile round-trip  but other options allow you to loop around for almost 2 miles before you retrace a lot of your steps.  There is a lookout spot part of the way up the mountain as well as a couple of features at the top.  At the top there is a shaded area as well as an observation deck.  As another BAMF has mentioned  the circular observation area calls out to you with a sweet invite...asking  maybe even demanding  that you bring a yoga mat and practice on top of the mountain...so do it...or at least post an empowering yoga pic for the rest of us...never know when you'll provide the inspiration that motives another being to positive change!...alas  it will have to wait till next time for me!  It is not the best park in the world...or the states for that matter  but the uniqueness it offers the Vegas Valley is reason enough for 5 stars in my book!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Best park in Vegas! I love climbing the hill with my kids.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Vegas is Sun City. It is a blessed land with beautiful parks to spend time in the sun. Exploration Park  off Buffalo Drive and immediately south of Blue Diamond Road is one of many. It is a park with two sections. At a higher elevation  it is a hiking park up Shoelace Mountain. At ground level it is a neighborhood park within an oval paved trail. This review is separated by the two sections of Exploration Park.  SHOELACE MOUNTAIN     Last weekend was my second hike up Shoelace Mountain. Both in September. Heading into the cooler months  this is an ideal warm-up hike for the longer hikes ahead. Kind of similar to a golfer warming up at a miniature golf course. In reality  Shoelace Mountain is more of a large hill than a mountain. From my observation  Shoelace Mountain is approximately the exact hight of the powerlines along Blue Diamond Road.    I rate the 30-40 minute round-trip hike and views from the two summits a solid 4 stars. The views are just awesome! They look down on a valley with the Strip in center stage  Red Rock  and a landscape transitioning from desert to Von's and suburbia. Both summits feature a shaded picnic table.      The trails are dirt and gravel. I address using caution after the first summit where the trail is especially gravely. Because the trails are unkind to a sneakers appearance  I suggest wearing an old pair with good traction or hiking boots.      I learned there are two trails up Shoelace Mountain. The popular trail originates from the oval walkway in the community park section. The less popular trail originates from the southeast corner of Buffalo at Blue Diamond. I highly recommend exploring both trails for a few reasons. From the viewpoint of the less popular trail's segment parallel to Blue Diamond  Shoelace Mountain does look like a shoe. This is  4 star picture material. In my opinion the less popular trail is not as steep as the more popular trail. Exploring both trails will extend your hiking experience. For the record both trails intersect immediately past the first summit.  NEIGHBORHOOD PARK     Exploration Park is a first-rate neighborhood park that celebrates Shoelace Mountain. The oval trail that encircles the park  affords spectacular views of Shoelace Mountain. Even at night  when Shoelace Mountain is illuminated and used as an occasional movie screen.     Exploration Park also celebrates a high quality of life for visitors. The manicured grassy field within the oval trail is welcoming. A state-of-the art playground adorned with western store-front facades and a splash pad improves a family's quality of life. A smooth trail surface with dog scoop stations increases a dog owner's quality of life. A security presence increases everybodys quality of life. Security patrols the park on foot and bike.   Will I return to Exploration Park? Vegas is Sun City! It offers so many beautiful parks to spend time in the sun. I am anxious to spend time in as many of the parks as possible. Eventually I will return to Exploration Park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is my favorite park in Vegas!   2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge -     12/100   I've heard about this park from family and friends over the years  but didn't experience it myself till sometime last year. After that  I began coming here for my morning cardio (walk/run/hike) several days a week.   I agree with many of the reviews for this park. It has a little bit of everything and more.   - A bad ass playground I wish existed during my childhood.   - A huge grassy area for picnics  soccer  and just laying out to relax  read a good book  write or draw. I've seen some photographers do their photo sessions here.   - There is a path way to a small mountain  great for a short hike.      It's a great hike if you want to do a solo hike in the morning. Every morning that I've been here there were others hiking the trail  doing their morning cardio/workouts as well. So I felt safe knowing that there were others around if I accidentally fell or what not.   - There is no cement trail up and down the mountain.  It's just dirt and gravel. So be careful.  - There are different pathways up and down the hill for the adventurous souls. (Not recommended for beginners. Check out the trail first before you go exploring :-) )   - There are two levels up the mountain. So you can rest at the 1st level. It has a shaded picnic table and a great view of the city.   - At the top  there's a huge platform with an amazing view of the city. With a little bit of Nevada history. It's peaceful at the top. And reminds me why I love nature and this city.   - Some people do their Tai Chi and/or meditation in the morning. Either at the top of the mountain or in the park.  It's peaceful to watch.   - There's a small cement stage at the other end of the park. I'm guessing for plays and performances during the warmer months.   - Bathrooms are clean and stocked every morning.   - Great park to bring your doggies and fur buddies as well.   *** Tip: If you don't live in Mountain's Edge & you're coming from I-15/Blue Diamond or 215/Buffalo  it's on Buffalo road & you'll have to make a U-turn to get to the entrance of this park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"Living LA and being used to paying for everything  this was a nice change bee brought our kids and we kept saying ""this place is free???"" We would have paid cover. Kids had a blast and park was safe for parents to relax and allow the kids to play. Wish I could bring the park with me to LA."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,It's nice but far. The trail leads to a nice view. There is a playground for kids and a wet play area. Good for dogs  joggers  kids and those who just want to relax in the park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Just moved to the proximity of this park and my baby husky needed to find a new place to run around and explore.   This park is definitely the cleanest park I have ever been to. Its also safe with security on patrol during business hours.   The playground also makes me feel adolescent again. Its huge and very well maintained. The only problem I have with this park is that it doesnt really have a place where you can do aesthetic exercises.  Theres even a mini hiking trail at this place.. come on now  what kind of park has a hiking trail? Just makes it that much better. Very diverse.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Such a nice park! They have a big playground where kids can be kids and adults can be kids! Lol. It's so big that I could walk and play all around it! They have a huge mountain that you can hike and it's a beautiful scene! There's lots of grass space to place games like football  soccer  tag  etc. There's a trail for walking  and it's super nice to just lay a blanket out and stare at the stars at night. I love this park!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great place to walk around  beautiful sites and beautiful landscaping! I love living in this area!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,beautiful park!   one day me and my friend decided to hike instead of workout and came here since it's right new my place. I've only seen the mountain that everyone is hiking but it much bigger than that. they have fields where people can sit and chat or picnic  or even kick around a ball. they also have a play area for kids which was packed when we went. they have some parking but it's usually almost full. best best best part has to be the view at the top  you can see the whole city and i know i wish it was open at night it would be just beautiful!!!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is big enough to accommodate hikers  families  kids  dog people  and casual park goers.    And it's green!  There is actual lush grass at this park  and if I were younger I would roll down the hills (I'm kinda jealous of the kids that do this).    The trails up the mountain are people and dog friendly  and there are spots to take a break and take in the view.    Oh  the parking is great too  and the bathrooms are clean!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,In a city without much green grass- this park is an oasis. There is an area for horseshoes  volleyball  bbqs  a large play area for kids  and the bathrooms are  centrally located. There is a sidewalk all around the perimeter which is great to explore the park. If you are feeling adventurous and are wearing a good pair of tennis shoes- then venture up to the top of the peak for a 365' view of our beautiful city.  My only gripe is that the lawn is usually damp and some places even have puddles. I have been there mid-day when the sprinklers come on and spray all over the sidewalk.  Dogs are allowed as long as leashed.  Also  there are only a few trees so be aware during hot weather-bring a hat and some water.  This is a very popular park for families so it can get crowded early on holidays.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Going to Exploration Park is one of the 100 Reasons Why I Love Living in Las Vegas. My husband and I take our dog for a walk a few times a week usually at night. I love how there is always security around and the park is still popping even at 8 pm.  The layout of the park offers something for everyone. Lots of grass  walking trails  picnic areas and recreational activities. The play area is huge and they even have a little water park. There is always something happening on the weekends whether it's a dog festival or summer movie nights.  They keep the park very clean and I love how visitors even show pride in the park by picking up after their dogs. I still haven't climbed up the hill but that is definitely on my To Do List once the the temperature drops down a bit.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"THIS is the best of the best parks in Las Vegas/Henderson/Summerlin.   My husband and I needed something to do the day after Christmas. We were still groggy from eating turkey and drinking the day before though. We really did not feel like driving all the way to Red Rock. I happened to locate this park right here on Yelp  and noted from the reviews there is a small ""mountain"" (hill) to hike up.  When we arrived the park was full of children and adults alike. The children were playing on the Western themed playground equipment  and some were running around on the large expanse of green grass. The park is very well kept. It looks as though it could be plopped down into a city like Colorado Springs and not be out of place.   ""Shoelace Mountain"" is an easy hike  not too far up  not too steep  even for beginners this would be kind of easy. I am a wussy when it comes to going DOWN anything though  so of course  I had to inch my way down after we made it up. Once you get to the top there is a look-out place with information regarding the Las Vegas Valley and surrounding areas. You can see the strip  all of the valley and look across to Red Rock as well. There are also picnic benches up at the top.  Overall this park is a perfect retreat for city-dwellers who don't want to go far to ""get away""."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,A large beautiful park for all kinds of fun activities  e.g.: kids playing  walking  running  dog walking  valleyball  soccer/football  frisbee   picnic  or simply just relaxing...!  AND yes  one can even do REAL HIKING on a REAL hill! On its peak  there's a spectacular view of the city of Vegas/Henderson and surrounding mountain ranges! - This park is meticulously maintained and very well patrolled by park security.  MORE DETAILS  - It is a large  very popular park for locals and tourists of ALL ages! This park has endless green lawns; a western-themed children's play area; valleyball courts; covered pavilions  paved trails around the park (~1mi). There are concrete benches and picnic tables everywhere. Yes  there is restroom facility here  too.   - This park is a kids' heaven with its spacious  interesting playground  which even has a circular court with water spouts shooting out columns of water at different time intervels to amaze and delight the children  and entertain their parents and grandparents!   REAL HIKING ON THE HILL? - YES  Seriously!  Much to the delight of us city-hikers  we can do REAL hiking on a real hill here  too! There is a large Circular Observation Deck with a magnificent  panaramic view of Vegas/Henderson  the Spanish Trail...and surrounding mountain ranges! [See pics]! This great deck is quite educational on Vegas history and geography  as is breathtaking in beauty.  There are about 0.5mi gentle hiking trails around the hill.  One can hike this Exploration Peak (~200+ft vertical) in a combination of different routes. There's a covered pavilion on the  mid-hill and one on the top with great views  perfect for picnic or taking a rest.  The hike is short and quite gentle  the views are spectacular  thus very popular for all ages.  - Hiking up the trails  I have seen todlers walking on a leash; young dads pushing a stroller up  elderlies hiking up on canes...not to mention people hiking their pets up and down! Of course  it's not uncommon to see young legs running up and down the slopes!  Notes: 1.  While uploading pics  I found out that our Yelper hiker Daniel S. had already given an excellent  informative and interesting review on Exploration Peak Park a couple of months back. You'll find it worth yourwhile reading it!  2. Reference Website:  http://www.mymountainsedge.com/amenity.asp?id=2  Peterskis  Nov 2012 ---
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"Gotta show some love to my home park. I don't go here often  but when I think about what it has to offer  it really does stack up against the best local parks in the valley. Granted  it doesn't have basketball or tennis courts. But I think it more than makes up for that with its expansive grass areas that are the perfect venue for things like ""Movies Under the Stars"" and the ""1st Annual Mountain's Edge Snow Day.""  Of course  the first thing that you notice is Exploration Peak. A lot of people make fun of how small it is or how it looks like they just dumped a bunch of dirt next to the road. Honestly  despite it being a laughably short hike to the top  it's nice to have. It has a good view from the top and there are even places up there (and half way up) for you to just sit and chill (almost literally at this time of year).  As for the kiddie play area  well I can't say I've really checked it out  but it looks extremely well designed. They went with an old western theme with the play sets and I think they pulled it off nicely. That reminds me. My best fake miniature photo was taken of the play area from the top of Exploration Peak."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park for kids.  Lots of playground area.  Big mountain for hiking for adults and kids can even make it up.  Huge great grass area for all kinds of playing.  They also have a small water area which is great in the summer.  My only complaint is that they do not have a shade overhang over the playground area.  It gets super hot during the summer and its a little hot to be playing and/or touching the equipment.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is very well kept up. The grass is so crazy green  not hardly a dandelion or foxtail in sight! The playground is big and a cool Wild West theme. The reason we came was for the hike up the peak. It's actually a very short hike and not really much of a workout. It takes about 10 mins to get to the top. The view is pretty nice though. If you're in the area it's a very clean park to come hang out at  but since we live in the NW  we probably won't be coming back for the hike.  However  there's those secret caves nearby off Fort Apache that's a great workout to get up there! ;)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is by far my children's favorite park in Las Vegas. We live in the NW side of town and I don't mind making the drive to play on all the different equipment that is offered at this park. It is not your average slides and swings kind of park  although that is there too! There are many things to climb  ride and spin on  so fun!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Give credit to where it deserved.  I have always walked on this park ever since I've lived in the Mountain Edge community  and I keep coming back because it is well-maintained and atmosphere-friendly.  There's an easy hiking trail on the hill and a paved path for casual walking. Playground galore: kids  adults  and dogs  whether you want to wet your feet on the water splash  or walk barefoot on the green-trimmed grass  it's circulatory heaven for your sole. Picnic perfect under the pavilion or on the benches  I guess you can eat on the grass too  it will take you away from the cookie cutter view that you usually see from your balcony. Oh or you can fly a kite if you want to.  Bring your Nike's  next time you are in the area  walk and wander/wonder.  Oh and ah you will be rewarded with an awesome view of the sandstone cliffs of Red Rock Canyon  and maybe a red hot-air balloon too  on top of the hill  yeah.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is amazing. Totally worth a trip if you have time. I shot a video of the park  I am heavily into the hip hop music scene in Las Vegas. Check it out. Sucker 4 Love Part Two by lazy rich. Shows detailed images of the best park on the lower westside.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great walking park. Very clean and easy to access. I live the quietness and all the stuff nearby. I will come back here often.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Overall a great park to take the dogs for a walk. It has a small mountain attached to the path which has some great views of the Las Vegas area at the top. I've lived in Vegas for a few years now but only found this place recently. We go here a few times a week now.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,If I had a small child  I'd bring them to play here... (Old western theme playground  covered wagon play structure  slides  swings and even a water play area).  If I had a dog  I'd walk him here... (tons of pop bags throughout the park)  If you challenged me to horseshoes  I'd beat you here... (several horseshoe pits)  If you challenged me to a game of volleyball  you *might* beat me here... (nets provided  bring your own ball  cuz I don't have one)  If you wanted to have a contest to see who could roll down the hill fastest  I'd stand at the top and watch you look silly  here... (grassy hills and tons of area to picnic and play)  If you wanted to start your morning with a 3 mile walk  we'd lose track walking laps here... (nicely paved walking paths  but they are somewhat short  I have no idea how many laps would equate to a mile)  If you wanted unobstructed views of the entire valley  we'd hike the exploration Trail here... (2 846-foot-high Exploration Peak with walking and bike trails)  If you want to make friends with a security guard on a bike  you'll find him here... (I swear  he's the friendliest guard I've ever seen. He seems to know EVERYONE)  If you had a birthday  I'd rent a pavilion and host your surprise party here... (unless you'd want there to be alcohol  in which case it'd be at my place. SURPRISE!)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,The family enjoyed the hike immensely! A fun little place to get some excercise. The views are incredible! Lots of dirt and concrete walking paths. Keep your dogs on a leash  they patrol the area and enforce it.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I really like this park. If you have kids they have a huge playground area with that should keep them busy for half a day! They have shaded picnic tables all around the park and a couple Volley Ball courts as well.   If you're up for a little physical activity there's a short hike up to a peak that has views of the entire valley. They also have some picnic tables to enjoy at the top as well.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My favorite park! I love hiking up the hill and enjoying the view. The park is always clean and well maintained. My daughter really enjoys the water feature and playground here also.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My favorite place to go running and bring the kids. Love that it is patrolled by security and they have a great dog park. One of the best parks ive been to and a favoite place for us to throw birthday parties!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,A picnic  barbeque and hike getaway with the family and good friends? Exploration Park is the answer.   I have gone up shoelace mountain with one of my close friends before and it was a pleasant hike  light enough to recommend my parents to join us the second time around.   We got to pick a nice little picnic area with a barbecue pit right by the parking area and horse shoe pit overlooking a lush grassland. There my parents prepped the charcoal while the rest of us arranged the necessary utensils then proceeded to exploring the rest of the park which undoubtedly had the capacity & the facilities to accomodate a wide variety of groups from families  to children  to joggers  to animals and people interested in volleyball or hiking  etc. I even got a chance to just walk around and spot some mockingbirds for the fun of it.   Bathrooms were clean and the concrete pavements were safe and great to walk/run on. After filling our tummies up  we stayed for talks then proceeded to Shoelace Mountain. It was my parents' first hiking experience and thanks to the wonderful weather and their enthusiasm  they breezed through it. We then found ourselves at the peak and gazed at the city in awe. People may need to go up here every once in a while to be reminded of how beautiful Vegas is  breathe in the fresh air and just exhale out the stresses of the week. Couldn't have been more refreshing than it was.   On our way back  we caught site of the playground and noticed all the fun stuff the kids were enjoying. Be sure to check that place out if you have kids. If not  perhaps bring a picnic blanket and enjoy some munchies on the grassland. This park has a lot to offer and fall is a great time to treasure the facilities even more.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I've always loved this park  but I hate that it closes. If there's security there to keep it safe  why close? There's been numerous times around 9-10 pm I've wanted to go up the mountain and sit at night to clear my head but security won't let you in. :/
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,The park is wonderful  I live within walking distance from here. I take my 2 daughters here all the time. They love the water feature and sand area. I wish they make it a non-smoking area. I understand it's an outdoor area  but my kids don't need to inhale nasty smoke when they are trying to get some fresh air.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,The best park in the community! Well taken care of by the HOA. Plenty if space to have fun and see other families enjoying themselves as well. Such comfy grass. The hike up the peak is not bad. Plenty of dog stations for people to pick up their dogs crap. The only bad thing is the bats that fly around at night during the movies at the park!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love going to park. But I never thought that I would love a park as much as this park. I have visited pretty much almost every single park in Las Vegas area. I usually go to park either to walk a dog  reading a book  or just to smell the scent of fresh green grass.   This particular park strikes me the most. If this park is an iPhone  than it really makes other park looks like a stupid calculator.   Why do I like this park so much?  The grass  it is so green to the point where it almost like being sprayed by a green paint. At the end of my park exploration  my blue jeans has turned into a green jeans.   The temperature  I swear it got to be the same temperature as in California  without the humidity of course. I usually go at night  and at my area where it's about 80 degrees at night  it feels like 70 degrees here.   Security  this is the only public park where I could actually see the security guard. It just adds an extra layer of safety feeling  especially at night where some weirdos seem like to show up. Most other parks I've been to? The security guard never seems to exist.    Cleanliness  you can tell that someone actually takes care the restroom. One of a few parks with a clean restroom.  Bicycle trails and walking paths  which is one of my favorite part of the park. It lets you wonder on what can you explore. I saw a wild rabbit during my walk. I tried to chase it down  but I afraid I will ended up at the Wonderland.   Location  since it's not located at the center of Las Vegas. This park is not affected by the Strip light as much. It makes the park a little darker at night. And that's a good thing! It just feels more intimate.  This is the only park in Vegas that I am proud to tell friends to go  especially for those that need some soul searching. Seriously  it's good for your soul.     PS: Please don't crowd this park and destroy it. I don't want to regret that I ever written this review...
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,While visiting my cousin   I wanted to go for a morning mini jog/hike. My cousin informed me about the park/mini mountain. Since I'm always up to venturing off to new places  I checked it out.  The park/play are for kids and is perfect for a family and kids of all ages.  Pass the park/playground is the beginning of the hike trail. The trail was well plotted out with a nice incline. Nothing too intense unless you decided to go off trail and climb up the side of the mountain to make it more challenging.  Overall  pretty cool little hikiing/exercise area. Definitely will utilize the mountain for future workouts/training anytime I'm visiting LV
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"How's about a 30-minute hike to get away from the woes of the city? Exploration Park is a beautiful park for children and hiking spot for families of all ages to enjoy! At the halfway point  there is a small bench area where a breathtaking view of the Strip can be seen; or teenagers can venture up there to gossip about their high school lives without being overheard by other vicious gossip-mongers that you can find in school.   At the top of the peak  there is a circle terrace and another bench area where the view of the city is even more dazzling. The trail is a very small hike and really good for kids and beginners that want to step into the world of the outdoors. Make sure you can handle this small mountain before taking on bigger game ;)   At the bottom is a big play park for children with multiple swing sets and slides. They even designed it so it looks like the Ol' Vegas West!! It even has a tiny mountain replica that smaller kids can ""hike"". It's just way too cute for words!   So how about a hike? Exercise  exercise  EXERCISE! Get those New Years Resolutions done while letting your kids play!!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,The park is really pretty. The exploration park peak hiking trail is short but steep and offers a beautiful view. I like the short hike and it took about 12 minutes to make it to the top.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"We've been coming to Exploration Park for quite some time now and its good to see its pretty much the same (or better) than when it first opened.  It's a good park with lots to do for kids -- sand area  slides  play area with lots of climbing opportunities (ropes/jungle gym  ""mini hills""  chain links  etc) all down up in a western theme.  They also have a nice water feature that's partially shaded in some areas (so the parents can have some refuge from the hot sun! Very important detail!).  We love the ""mountain"" that you can walk the trails to the top called ""Exploration Peak"".  There's a structure halfway up that affords a nice expansive view of the Strip on one side and a nice view of the Mountain's Edge community on the other side.  The park has several free events throughout the year - movies in the park  family events  and concerts like ""Country in the Park"".   Other plusses are: ample parking  plush green grassy spaces (perfect for letting yoir child loose!  rolling down the hills and flying a kite)  picnic and BBQ areas and I think there is still a horseshoe area.   Oh yeah--when you climb to the top of the ""mountain"" there's a large circular pad/land and when you stand right in the center of it and clap your hands or speak - its like you're in a sound booth/recording booth :)....try it out!!!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,There are many good reviews for the park. For me it turned out to be much to far away and there was heavy construction work on the route to the park. This is home building along the Buffalo from 215 to the park. Many trucks and a rough road with numerous 4 way stops that kept me guessing as to whether it was my turn to go.   The park itself has a nice paved walkway with  but it is broken up with repairs right now. I really didn't get the mountain part mentioned by others since from where I was  it is fenced off with no trespassing signs  on the fence.   There is a beautiful expanse of grass in the center of the park which is nice. I only glanced at the kids activities and there seems to be many types of gym equipment and structures. Others have reviewed these.  If you live close  give this park a look. My drive from the north was 30 minutes on 215 so it is really too far for a short visit.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,It's a nice park to bring your kids if you have one. They have a huge playground. The hike is very easy  but a bit slippery because of loose rocks. The run down is good.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I love this park I hate hiking and consider the trail up the hill a hike for me. The trail is fast and takes only about 10 minutes walking. Perfect for someone like me. There's also ""shortcuts"" that go up the hill but is at a much more steeper incline. Did it once but nope never again I'll take the long way around. Beautiful view at the top that over looks the west side of Vegas and even the strip. Especially beautiful during sunrise or sunset. I bring my dog here and he loves it too! The playground is also cool and filled with fun slides and jungle gyms for the kids (and little dogs like mine if you hide from security lol)."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My go to park in the SW area when bringing kids that are just too energetic for me to handle. The jungle gym area is a cool western theme and is big enough for groups of children to run around and enjoy. There's see saws  spring horses  a tangled rope play area  a tower that overlooks the park  a swing set  some slides  and a water play area. The grass fields are real grass hills that feel cool under your feet. You could roll down them in a race like kids. There is a volleyball court too.  When I can't make it to the gym or I want to do a quick cardio hike  I go here. The trail to the top is steep  but manageable. If you're going to go up it  wear good shoes. Your ankles might slip if you wear flip flops.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is my favorite park that i have been to so far in las vegas! It is just beautiful! Hiking  awesome kids playgrounds  perfect for picnics  birthday parties & any other kind of family outings. I could spend all day at Explorations Park with my family and it would always be a great day to remember!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I thought this was a very cute park. I was looking for a little mini hike to take my son. He's very bouncy  active and never has been a hike before. This was perfect for him to experience his 1st hike. The view at the top was great  we took a lot of pictures. After we went down he played at the cute little park set up like an old little pioneer town. Everything was very clean and new looking. There were a lot of bday parties going on that day  and was busy with lots of kids. I guess there is a water or splash park too but it was currently closed  but is supposed to be opening soon. Very nice area around it as well. All in all it was since park that we will visit more often.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Nice neighborhood park. Clean bathrooms. Lots of parking but there's never any east way to get over if you drive in going west on Buffalo  construction  no U turn signs and poorly planned road medians. Tons of grassy space for kids  adults and animals to play. Small volleyball area with adjacent picnic tables. Large children's play area. Picnic areas scattered throughout the park. It gets busy on the weekends  sometimes parties or events are being held. Great little hike spot as well  meander up and around Exploration Peak for great views and some exercise or follow the paved walking paths around the park if your not up for the climb.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Well maintained  clean and safe. Lots of activities year round for the family. Love this little green gem in the desert. Walking  hiking  biking  open grassy field and a playground for the kids  Exploration Peak Park has everything in one place.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I've been meaning to write about my neighborhood park for awhile.  Although I don't frequent it that often  the few times I have was a good experience.  I've climbed the little trek up to Exploration Peak for a view of the southwest area.  A few times the Husband has gone for a run up there.  One summer we rode our bikes out to Exploration Park and all around there.  I've taken a toddler to the playground area and he adored the western theme and the grassy fields to run down and fall into.  They also have a 'water area' but I could never figure out when they have it turned on or not.  Days that you think they would have it  they don't!   I've never made it to the ""Movies Under the Stars"" (probably because I didn't know when it was but probably would have gone)  so I couldn't ever take advantage of their amphitheater setting.  I did pass by for their ""1st Annual Mountain's Edge Snow Day"" and the snow pile was a bit small from what I was expecting.  But it looked like the kids loved it nonetheless.  Overall  it's a pretty park and large in comparison to others.  Parking can be a challenge on spring and fall weekends when guests arrive early to score the tables and limited shaded areas for parties and what not.  They also have security on bike patrol  which helps keep the riffraff out.  4.5 stars"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Beautiful park!! If you're a southern kid like me and you need a bit of greenery in your life  this is the place to go. You can go hiking up the mountain  which gives you a great view of the city and Las Vegas Strip. Also  a playground for the kids  and plenty of space for the pup to run around.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"No  it's not the newest  classiest hotel on the Strip featuring a one hectare pool and 45.7 million rooms. No  it's not a trendy casino wedged in between Aria and Monte Carlo that you never noticed before. And no  it's not a new buffet sporting a longer line than the Wynn  Wicked Spoon  and Bacchanal combined.  It's just a simple little park in the southwest portion of Vegas  which happens to be fairly close to where my parents live. And let me tell you  in a dry  desert landscape with nothing but highways  big-box strip malls  and cookie-cutter tract homes  it's literally an OASIS. If you were dying of thirst in the desert  I'm pretty sure this is the mirage you would see in the distance. But it's not a mirage  it's real!  I come here with my family and/or dog-spring (Get it? Dogs/off-spring? No? Will it ever catch on??! Sigh) every time I come to visit Vegas  usually for major holidays.   We've hiked up the peak  which sports a killer view of all of Vegas  with ample sunset silhouette photo opportunities to do the ""drunken master"" pose or the ""hold your  poor  unbeknownst dog in the air to look like Simba"" pose or even the ""cheesy eskimo kiss"" pose. It's a short hike and kinda steep in parts  but overall great for families to do together (from younger granny to the little ones).  We've picnicked on the beautiful  supple grass that you don't want to step on because it's always so pristine and slightly damp  due to the fact that I'm sure it eats up half the State's water resources. Not kidding. It's immaculate.   We've played dangerous games of grass volleyball at the v-ball courts with family members that believe volleyball consists of hitting the ball directly at faces.   We've walked our dog-spring along the very dog-friendly paths within the park  which sport waste buckets and complimentary poo bags every 50 feet like every park should do.  We've sat and envied the children in the BALLER western-themed playground for being able to slide on the slides without getting judgmental  funny looks from other adults. My gah  it looks fun in there.  We've walked confidently into the bathrooms knowing it won't smell like you're ACTUALLY inside someone's a-hole. Cleanest park bathrooms I've seen!  And we've NEVER had trouble parking  even during holiday weekends or perfect weather.   In the middle of a shitty desert  AN OASIS I TELL YA!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Very impressive  great water park for kids and is very expansive. So many things to do here. You can easily spend the entire day here!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I've never been to this park and wouldn't have if it wasn't for our potluck UYE being held here  but this is a very nice park.   There's big areas of  grass that was actually green and a bit hilly  theres a pavilion with picnic area and also smaller one off around the park  a  playground with water features. There's a easy hiking trail from here called Shoelace Mountain which is a a hike up to some wonderful views. I didn't get to go up since we were here for the picnic. Trail originates from the oval walkway in the community park section or the other trail is on corner of Buffalo at Blue Diamond.  There was a event going on so we found one table in a far corner. If you are having a large picnic  I guess double check with the park. It seems like a popular and fairly busy park when it was light. We were some of the few once the dark went though. Since there wasn't enough room by our table a guard kept getting on us about being on a sidewalk by our table. There were bikers  walkers  etc but anytime we saw once we announced a clear for everyone.   Overall nice park  and decent hiking option for nice city views.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,We met at the park to carpool to the Desert Tortoise Conservation Center.  I wasn't there long  but it was long enough to know that I wanted to come back and walk to the top of the hill that overlooks the Las Vegas Valley.  The facilities looked like they were well taken care of and the children's area had a stage coach that the kids were playing in and having a great time.  There are a lot of sidewalks through the area and it seems a great place to walk or jog.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,So lucky to have this great little park so close to my home.  If we had little ones they would just love this park.  The awesome playsets they have that resemble a Old West Town make me wish I was a kid.  I can see why it can be packed at times as the little ones just love to come here and immerse themselves in the play area.     I come here for the small mountain that is included in the park.  it is great for a quick workout and to prep for more treacherous hikes.  We test new shoes here so that we don't find out too late on a long hike that they are going to run our feet.  We also bring our furry friends here for a couple of laps around the concrete walkway.  They just love coming here and seeing some new friends.      This park is well maintained and has something to offer for everyone.  A great way to spend an evening or early morning.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Beautiful park with tons of play options for the kids. Lots of picnic areas too.  Has some volleyball areas and lots of green open spaces. Has a decent walking trail and a nice hill to walk up and look out over the city.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park  but beware. There is a large pack of coyotes living right on the other side of the mountain and they are not afraid of people.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My monkeys LA LA LOVE this park. It is their favorite place in the world. If mommy didn't have to work...they would be there all day. Tons of smooth sidewalk for rollerblading  walking and running...challenging uphill trails and a HUGE playground for the kiddies (it sports a western motif). Its nice to have lots of parents there to talk to (I consider myself a social person) and its a great way to socialize your offspring. The only reason it isn't getting 5 stars is that I wish there was a gate around the large playground area. There are just too many places my wandering monkeys (they are 3 and 2) can get into trouble. It won't be that way forever so I am guessing their star value will increase to a 5 in the years to come.  Sooo....if you see two ginger children running around and an exasperated tall redhead chasing them around...come over and say hi.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Best park on the west side of Vegas. I'm here all the time. It's good for younger toddler years also. Very safe. A lot of room and different toys to play on. Seems like it's well run and managed. The architecture  sand pits  and rope climber are all so unique. My daughter loves the snake and lizard statues. There's something for everyone here. AND a water park in the summer.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is a great park to bring dogs or to go for a walk.  At night the light shines on Mountain's Edge and it is very cool!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Exploration Park and Shoelace Mountain are right next door and I frequent them both 3-4 times a week on average; they are both fun to explore and I always see park staff keeping the grounds clean (pet owners aren't cleaning up after themselves or littering) I really don't know how long the trail is but one of these days I will buy a tracking device and measure how many miles my hike is.  It generally takes less than an 30 mins to walk up down and around Shoelace and another 20 mins our so to walk the trail in Exploration park;   The park is a kids dream with newer slides and climbing apparatus; there are open fields for sports like soccer  baseball and football; there are plenty of grills and seating areas; I don't know how I lucked out in living so close to this park but I thank my lucky stars every time I walk across the street (it does need a cross walk)   Oh and on a side note; Shoelace Mountain isn't a mountain; I realize the paths on it and the shape of the hill make it look like a shoe but Its just a big rock formation that really should be classified as a Monadnock; I understand how Mountain is better suited for the regular person who didn't take and or pass earth science in JR. High so Mountain it will be.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,We come here every morning for our morning hike after the bike ride around Mountain's Edge through the walking paths that keep us safe from the insane drivers that live here in my neighborhood. The Mountain has a myriad of pathways that you can take up down and all around to allow for maneuvering through the crowd when the weather is not as hot. The morning time when we go  there are a lot of walkers and occasionally a few runners that sprint up and down the mountain like its just flat ground.  The park 'seems' walker & biker friendly MOST days but one day there was an older Asian couple walking the rounds one day and we ended up coming up on them on the walkway. Most of the walkers move to the side when they hear us slowly coming up (doesn't seem like too much to ask but maybe that's me) however this couple was standing their ground  so I took out through the grass to pass by them and when I came back up to the concrete I didnt get enough of an angle on the approach and the grass was wet so I went down hard on the concrete. The couple walked right on by and never even acknowledged the wreckage. Seemed rude.  Other than that we have our doggy friends we say hi to every morning with their handlers and the regulars we see most everyday. Its a really nice park here for our neighborhood and the community plans a lot of outings here  walks  fund raisers etc. Definitely nice to have such an amenity close by.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Trupanion is amazing!! My Hank and Bella have been under their policy for almost two years now and they have been absolutely a god send and worth every penny! Thank you for making insurance happen for pets... I don't know what we would do without you!! Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is awesome. The play structure is enormous and designed like the Wild West. There is a big tower to climb  a slide that goes through a mountain  and a stagecoach with horses to ride. The ground cover is wood chips though so best for closed toe shoes. Behind the playground is a small mountain for hiking even! So much fun!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Pros: great water area for kids Nearby Vegas strip Hiking with views   Cons: need a car if visiting Las Vegas
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Me and the Toddler are here regularly.  Water Park... Check! Giant Grassy area.... Check! Giant Mountainous Hill with Monument on Top... Check! Lots of moderately dangerous Kids play areas for different ages... Check! Clean Bathrooms... Check!  The concrete accoutrements of the play areas are rather well done. There's some snake and dinosaur shaped play equipment and a slide that goes through their concrete edifice.  There's always tons of people here on weekends and evenings  but the park is huge so it accomodates well. Great for large gatherings of people. Huge ethnic diversity as well (I call this a plus!) There's also a giant hill that is not for the be-rascaled. It's a decent feat to climb to the top and you get a beautiful view if completed.  The only thing this park lacks is a food and drink vendor (there is water) and one of those giant wheels to spin really fast. Minor complaints. Good for all ages.  Also: since when are wood chips decent playground flooring? They get into everything and cause splinters.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"This is by far my favorite park I take my 8 year old there she loves it they have this tall tower the kids can climb up my daughter likes to climb up it and yell ""I'm on top of the world dad"".it also has a large being that it is in mountains edge with trails to jog or walk to get my jog on!! Another great thing about it is lots of green grass to throw a freesbie or play catch.it is also a water park for those hot days.if you have kids or a dog this is your p"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Awesome park. I lived a couple blocks away from here and it's a great park. Not very reminiscent of the parks I grew up with. A lot of places to play at if you have kids I like the trail going around the park and the actual mountain you climb up on.   I just wished they had a basketball court in here. That would have completed the park and added that extra star.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Absolutely beautiful park. I love living in this neighborhood. This park is such a fun place to take a walk  a hike  or a trip to the playground. Beautifully well maintained grass and trails make this park a must see!   Come early in the summer because it doesn't offer a lot of shade but any other time of the year it is a great place to bring your dog or your kids!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is one of our favorite parks around. We love the 2 story western set up that the kids play on and rhe thing the kids an on and it rolls across about 12 feet. They used to have a wonderful rope jungle gym  but has been replaced with a pathetic 10 foot fake rock climbing thing. There is also a short hike many people bring their dogs on. It probably almost a mile round trip. Also great to get kids practice for later hikes. Not perfect  but over all a great park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park for Las Vegas.   I bring my dog here. They have a nice walkway throughout the park. They have lots of grass which is nice to relax on under the shade.   I love seeing rabbits  hummingbirds  dragonflies  birds.   My favorite park in the city. I don't live near the area but it's worth the drive. Great for kids... With the water park. Tons of parking and security on site.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I LOVE this park   everything is so green and it is very clean. I love taking pictures there and my clients are always happy with the location. Thank you for this great place.  :)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Best place in the city for a small hike. You can hide in the grass under a tree afterwards. Great view from the halfway rest area. My pup loved it. Great park.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Exploration Park leaves me nostalgic as an episode of Rugrats come to mind when they all went to the western park to face the bully that put gum in the blonde curly haired baby. LOL ANYWAY.  Well this park looks EXACTLY like it. So much to the point where I'd wish something like this existed back in the 90's for my deprived youth. I can only imagine how many kids role play playing Cowboys and Indians while playing hide-and-seek and drinking juice boxes. THE DREAM.  Other than the park itself  there's something for people of all ages to enjoy. Feeling a bit energetic? Walk the trails to the top of the mountain. Noticing the weather's nice out? Pack a picnic and lounge on the spacious field. Need a new dog walk trail? You'll happy to find that there are trails around Mountain's Edge that leads you up to the park. It's quite a scenic route walking there also.  I'm glad a place like this exists to escape the hustle and bustle that is Vegas. It feels nice to relax here without dropping a dime for once. This place can actually be zen like if you're lucky to experience that while posting here as well. Go with a friend or two- Especially during those beautiful Vegas afternoons.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,It's a lifestyle pack   William wright is a great elem. school for kids fantastic park for everyone  convenient markets  close to freeways to reach your destination and etc.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Perfect park for any age group.  There are two ways to get up the mountain- a steep route and a long route that wraps around the peak. You're only able to climb UP the steep route (which should describe how steep it is).  Going down it would be pretty risky- the only people I saw go down it were two young kids  however they decided to stop after slipping pretty badly. Don't try it!  The long route is still steep  but an easy climb. We got up the steep route in under 10 minutes  the long route took 15. The view at the top is beautiful- bring a yoga mat and enjoy the view!  The park below the peak is large and has a Western theme. I would have loved coming to this park as a kid!  Easy parking  lots of grass. Perfect place to spend the day :)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"This past trip to L.V. was a family visit. My wife & I were staying at the Silverton & were contemplating a morning work out in their health facility. Just seemed a bit boring to run on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike on an incredible morning such as this (Jan 22)!  So I called my mom & asked if there were any parks in the area that had a nice track or trail that we could run around...and as luck would have it  my parents & their friends were on their way to Exploration Park for a short walk & asked if we could join them. My parents live just a few short blocks away from the park. It's been quite sometime since I've seen a park as nice as this. Grass perfectly manicured  a hiking trail to which you could reach a peak with 360 views of SW Las Vegas. It has a children's play area that made me jealous that I was no longer a child. The park is clean & dog friendly. Everyone I noticed walking their dogs had ""baggies"" at their ready. This is a sight rarely seen in my neck of the woods.  TO ALL DOG OWNERS: it's just plain curtesy to pick up after your dog. To those owners who do pick up the doo  I applaud you. If you run the paseos at it outer most paths  it's approximately 1/2 a mile around the park. After approximately a 3 mile run  the wifey  my dad & his dog & I decided to hike up to the peak. Dad didn't quite make it to the top  there is a shaded rest area before dog-legging it to the right towards the peak. The wife and I enjoyed the veiws from the peak and read about the area via history lessons embossed upon rust colored plaques.  I can't comment on the restrooms  but before leaving  my wife used the women's facilities and commented how nice & clean it was. All in all an exceptional morning & pleasant experience here at SW Vegas' Exploration Park!  Another deez public announcement & I approve this review. Thanks & have a nice day!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Love this park. Something different from the typical blue and red play ground equipment you see everywhere. It's like a little town for kids and great for pictures. If you don't like watching and paying attention to your kids this is not the park for you because there is no gate and lots of places to roam. So it's perfect for us  we love it!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Awesome park plenty of space! The trail is awesome   the field is cool.  My kids love the water feature also.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This park is amazing! So many interactive things for all ages.  My favorite thing so far is that you can uncover a dino fossil in the sand box.   I went on a Sunday afternoon and it was pretty crowded  but the park is so big with so many things to do  it's not really an issue.   There's hiking trials up the mountain  ton's of grass for picnics and games of all kinds.   Great place for an afternoon outing!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Busy cute little park. Can take my pitbull on a hike.  I like the water fun area. Makes me feel like a kid. Great for exercise.  The grass is plush.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Well maintained park. I love the green and the walking trails are hilly  as well as the mountain. I have been to lot of parks here in Vegas  this is really nice.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,A little disappointed today....half of the sprinklers are not working at the splash pad today...
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I enjoy this park and try to do the long long hike up that mountain have so far done it 3 times since hiking in L.A.  I Love the fact that it is so close to my house and it is always clean no matter when I have gone.  Since I live @ mountains edge they had better keep it clean since I have to pay the association fees lol    Oh yeah and the security at night is nice too.  Great for walking your dogs and great little area for little kids if you have them.    Phew I am tired out from thinking about the hike lol  Happy Yelping xoxoxoxo
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,When my hubby & I were looking for our new home  I heard of this park... And it was one of the major contributing factors for making the choice to move to Mountains Edge. We used to live in Alliante. I would actually drive all the way down here just to let our children play at this park because it was so fun. So large. So full of things to EXPLORE. It is larger than it seems. I really never get tired of coming here. Now we are only 1 mile away...just a few min bike ride.  The only negatives I have are: ****Only 2 normal swings? REALLY??!! *DUH* what moron agreed to this??!!  *Not enough parking...Especially when they have an event. :( *No crosswalks across Buffalo. :( *Entrance can only be accessed one way... And no U-Turn actually allowed-which everyone does anyway. :(
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,What a beautiful park! The actual jungle gym is massive! Fun (and big enough) for adults! The hike to the top of Exploration peak is what brought us here.... Everything is what's keeping us coming back! :)
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Beautiful neighborhood park. Park has a large play area and splash pad for the kids. Wish it had a pool..
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is a really nice park just past Blue Diamond Highway. Great 360 views from the top. Easy hiking with many trails. Large  grassy area for lounging  kids to play. Nice playground. Restrooms and lots of parking.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great spot for a hike or a run. Quick and easy for people who are in shape but still very doable for those trying to get into shape. Great views during sunset and sunrise but gets a little too crowded for my taste at sunset.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,The grounds are well kept  grass was lush and green. This park features paved walking paths as well as natural pathways.. Very large kids areas  with shaded and covered obstacles  sand pits  swings.. Very nice  I will come back for sure.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Be careful  my wife had her purse stollen at the park. The kid ran to the walking trail to the apartments. The security at the park   Found her ID & after dumpster diving  I got  her purse back.  lost debit card & her gps.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I love this park for my daughter  or my daughter loves this park. Being a residence of Mountains Edge I like that we have our own big park out here since it is the price of living here.  This park is spacious. I love their Little Wild Wild West theme. There are a lot of space for the kids  adults and dogs to roam about. The park has a water park  maybe 11-12 different play areas where the kids could play and a huge sand box that is Dinosaur themed  where the kids could play in the dirt. This park is suitable for all ages.  The bathrooms are clean  over all this park is very clean. They have pavilions where you can hold birthday parties  for some areas you have to call to make reservations in advance. The smaller ones however  are first come first serve.  The hike to the top is a nice little cardio exercise. Kids and dogs can do it as well. The view from the top is just beautiful. We like to hike up to watch the sun set.   Also  this park holds events on Holidays  such as Easter with the Easter Bunny  Christmas to take pictures with Santa etc and lastly   they also hold ""Movies under the stars"" when the weather gets cooler at least once a month  in the evening's here. You can lay your blankets on the grassy area  bring your snacks. They also sell food and beverages here. It's a nice way to have fun and cuddle up with your loved ones.  Remember  to stay hydrated. Bring lots of liquids and bring snack's in case the kids get hungry and closed toe'd shoes since this park has a little man made mountain where the kids cant stay away from. You're children will have a blast. Trust me :D."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I love love love this park! I take my children here all the time for a morning hike. It is actually challenging. The park sits on a big steep hill. The park is nice and spacious. The jungle gym is nice and classic. There is even a teeter totter! There are also grassy fields and you can bring your animals here. I like this park because it isn't so ""regulated"". There is room to move around and you actually feel like you are outside in your own personal space. They also have events at this park quite often with invitations to the whole community. If you live in the mountains edge area I would recommend coming here."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This place is incredible. I can sum it up in one word  the word that makes this park so awesome: variety.   I mostly go to parks to walk my dog  but sometimes I also go with my wife for a picnic  and I also enjoy taking my dog hiking. This place has something for everyone.   1. If you have a child  this place is super cool for the summer. They have a wild west themed play area that looks like a blast  and it even has a water area with water shooting up all over. If it wasn't for all the kids playing in it  I would have ran through with my dog after our hike!  2. They have plush grass areas that are perfect for picnics  and nice and open with a nice view around. This is a must also for dog walks  because all dusty and dirt walks get old quick.  3. They have LEGIT hiking. I sometimes don't feel like driving out to red rock  and my wife doesn't feel like going on a 2 hour hike. This place is PERFECT for that. The hike up the mountain next to the park is great exercise  strenuous enough to be considered a real hike  but short enough that you can go to the peak and down within an hour no problem. It's also superrrrr useful for dog walking  because my pup was extra tired with this hour walk and it didn't require a long hiking trip to get her that way. Great for breaking up the walk routine too.  When you get to the top of the mountain  the views of Vegas and the valley are phenomenal. Seriously probably top 3 views of the city  so that alone is worth the hike.   So great playground  great grass  and awesome hiking (with an incredible view). If this park were closer to my house  I would never go somewhere else!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park for lounging  walking the dog  or just about any sport. Enjoy the park and take a nice hike up the trail to exploration peak to get a great view of the city. I frequently stop by this park for jogs and workouts and its always clean and always kept up.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Love this park! Whenever my group of friends wants to have a picnic  this is where we go. The grass is always super green and the park is kept clean. They get a little pushy with keeping your dog on a leash  but that's understandable. Once in a while the trash cans are overflowing  but it's not a huge deal. There's a lot of space  both grassy and playground equipment. There's also a water feature that the kids can play in. Overall  one of the best parks I've been too in Vegas!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love taking my son to this park. Well used to when we lived in the area. Grass is always so green and we'll taken care of. I only gave the park 4 stars because of the grass area being closed for so long now. Last three times we attempt to have a picnic here it was still closed. It was a huge bummer. But regardless I love the park. So many cool unique areas for kids of all ages to play. The scenery around the whole park is beautiful. Specially at night with all the bunnies running around. The water park here is the one thing I really enjoyed with my son during the summer. Great park for dogs also. The security here is always very respected and fun to be around. I love that this park is very well taken care of.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I'm bumping this place up to 5 stars because after visiting a bunch of other parks around the city  this is my favorite. First of all  it's the one where my kid always has the most fun. They've got so many different things to keep toddlers occupied and happy. Second  the hill. The hill makes for a great workout if you want to sprint up it a few times. If you want to take it easy  go for a leisurely walk up to the top and bring lunch. At the very top they've got an outlook with several benches and a picnic table. It's one of the best views you'll get of the southwest and you'll be able to see the Strip in the distance.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park with lots to do. Large play ground  decent splash pad  nice bathrooms  large open areas and shaded picnic tables.   The playground is the highlight. Lots of equipment with multiple slides. The kids seem to really like the enclosed tube slides. There is a large sand pit with over sized animals the kids can climb on. And finally some rocks the older kids can scramble on.  Splash pad is jets shooting up. Great for water balloons and running. Lots of shade around outside of pad so good for parents.   Bathrooms here are in great shape the last two years so must have decent cleaning regime.   I really like this park and the running  screaming and giggling kids seen to enjoy it as well.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I can't bring myself to move out of the Southwest. One big reason being Exploration Park. I'm Kind of obsessed with this park. There's a miniature mountain ""Exploration Peak"" perfect for beginner trail runners and a paved area to relax on the top! It's the perfect ""nature"" workout without driving to red rock. It's the ""mountain"" to hike if you're short on time.  Pro Tip: bring a buddy + a couple of yoga mats. The cool breeze and great view of Las Vegas from the top will make a great Dandayamana-Dhanurasana Instagram. Don't lie. You know you want to do it. #Namaste yo."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I have hiked the mountain occasionally the views are spectacular. It's great place for exercising  and a great place for family. One of the nicest parks in Vegas.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is a nice park  the sprinklers are kind of weird.  The area is very slippery so put water shoes or something in the kiddies.  The playground area is not covered so it is extremely hot and unsafe for kids to play on.  Which is weird because most of the parks I've been to in Vegas have a cover over the playground.  There's a nice spot to grill and have a party close to the sprinkler.  Kids are normally easy as long as there is water on a hot sunny day.  Security was in the Area on a bike keeping an eye on things.  Would I go back maybe for a party but way too far of a drive to just go and hang out.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"Exploration Park is filled with summer memories: running around the playground with friends or hiking up the mountain with those a bit closer. I simply adore this park.   The western theme is not only prevalent; it's downright blatant - in the most endearing way. With little western storefronts adorning the playground  I have never felt any more of a desire to relive my childhood. In fact  I do - swing across zipline-esque contraptions  scaling the rope set-up  and pretending to be an archaeologist in excavating ""ancient ruins"". It's like I'm five all over again.  The other day  I came here with a friend just to exercise. Jogging around the pathways and using the clean grass for our stretches makes this park perfect.  The best part  hands down  would be the amazing view at the top of the mountain. A fifteen minute hike (at most)  and you can see the sunset over the Strip. Gorgeous at night when the stars are out. Downright breathtaking and not a bad idea of a date either (hint!).  I write all of this with the utmost jealousy. Kids nowadays have the coolest parks  but who's to say age should stop my inner child from coming out either."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,No better place to feel a little less surrounded by the city. My and my pup go here to study or just get some fresh air. View is gorgeous  not too busy. Easy climb. Also a great  tidy park surrounded by paths down below the peak. Love this place!!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great park to take the kids or to do a quick photoshoot just to clear your mind... Makes me feel back at home in the bay with all of the greenery ... You can also do a little hike while you're there  just be sure to watch your step- It can get a little scary going up...
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Best park ever!  Went here on a weekday early-mid morning  not a lot of people so there was plenty of room to run around and act like fool. Went up for a walk to the hill's peak and it was just a breathtaking view! 360 degrees of las Vegas! I picked a bad day to actually walk up there it was so windy I swear i could've just flown away if I wanted to! Sat in the grass area which was nice and relaxing unfortunately the grass was a little wet so my butt got wet haha. This is a nice place to have a picnic.  Try to come here when there aren't  a lot of people  it can get crowded especially when the weather's so nice and after school hours.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"This is a great park  but the security guards are obnoxious and the should be shut down over just them. The last two times we have had problems with them wanting to close the park early and being rude to people. We live right across the road from the park  and it is a waste of our tax dollars with people like this.   Last night we went to play horse shoes  grill out and just have a fun evening. In August in Vegas you really don't want to start grilling out before 8pm or so just due to the heat. We were finished grilling and eating about 9:15 the kids were playing on the play ground. We were just sitting at the table when at 9:18 the bicycle security guard came by and said ""you need to get packed up we are closing the park in 5-10 minutes"" his tone and demeanor was very rude. I was shocked as I knew the park wasn't supposed to close until 10pm  so I looked down at my phone to see what time it was and saw that it was 9:18 and said ""sir  I believe that the park doesn't close until 10:00pm and we intended on being gone by then"" the security guard said ""No  it closes at 9:30  do you want to make a deal of it"" at that time I got up and went to read the paper that is right on the cover for the table and showed him that it says 10pm. When I started to show him the paper he goes ""I don't care what the paper says  this is my park and my rules  you better be out of here or I will have you trespassed""  we ended up leaving around 9:45 but it is sad that our tax payers money pays for this employee's salary and puts food in his and families mouth."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"Amazing place to relax  go for a run  have a BBQ  or bring kiddos and let them run wild. There are plenty of shady spots to hide from the sun when it's too hot. There is also a fun splash and play to beat the heat as well. When it's windy  EP is a killer place to fly kites. You can have birthday parties  family gatherings  reunions  etc. here. There is also a fun hiking trail on a ""mountain"" that's more like a decent sized hill. Great for training or taking dogs for a quick excursion. Overall  EP is a fantastic place for kids and adults who want to feel like a kid again."
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Moving to Vegas  I needed a new thinking spot and I saw reviews on this park. It seemed so relaxing and I wondered how a park would work especially in Vegas. It made me smile when I came here  because there were many children enjoying the park's amusements for children. They seemed to really enjoy this weird hill thing I saw  but of course  my main focus at the park was to hit the trail.  While searching  there was a nice blend of green where you can have a nice standard picnic at or run a few laps around the track like roads  or move away and see a lot of desert instead. I never really saw parks like these before  so it was quite a bit interesting for me. Upon reaching the hiking trail itself  you'll notice a sign that pretty much tells you that you are advised only to hit the trail during daylight hours. I came during a time where the sun would set soon  because I wanted a nice bit of scenery.  The trail is relatively easy to climb and probably takes 10 minutes at MOST. I didn't have hiking shoes on so I slipped from time to time  but once I got to the top I was pretty amazed. There were picnic areas at the top and an area at the center to sit around and relax.  It made me realize how underdeveloped Vegas is the farther you are from the strip. It was quite interesting to see  but it also gave me a feeling of emptiness. You can see a lot of hills not too far away and the sunset was quite amazing. It was quiet at the top so I felt like I was able to keep a steady mindset while I was here.  When coming back down  I felt like a lot of weight was lifted. Usually downhill hikes can be painful  but because of how short this is  it's pretty light on the legs. (I did leg day at the gym shortly before this.)  I wish I had someone to take  but I can save that for another time.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Las Vegas parks kick ass over any park in San Diego and this place is a prime example. Tons of play features for the kids that all compliment the dessert landscape. Tons of shade with plenty of trees and canopied table areas. Huge grass area greener than anything I've seen back home. Lots of parking. Even have a security guard cruising around on his bike who was really friendly. Great job Vegas.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"love this park. the hike to the top of the hill is short and very rewarding. the grass here is lush. there are no homeless people. of the few times ive been here there was always a security guard on a bike. maintenance crews were gardening and singing while birds landed on their shoulders to fan them from the heat (cinderella and snow white would be impressed) while the trees bent down to help them trim their branches. ok so its not that magical but it is nice. i like to be able to take a walk or nap without worrying about drunk homeless people under trees or walking on needles or drug paraphernalia. i also like the fact that people come here to enjoy the park and are mostly respectful if it. no one bumpin their loud ass music or turning the parking lot into a impromptu car show. i was disappointed to see broken glass bottles around the top of the hill. this reminds me of what a park used to be back in the 80's before our innocence was destroyed by reality tv shows like ""jersey shore""  ""amish mafia""  and ""the kardumbshians"""
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,It's a nice park  great play area for kids if you have em. Volleyball  horseshoe and bbq area. Dogs must be kept on leash at all times and they enforce this rule. Exploration peak trail literally takes me 10mins up but if you're out of shape - this may be a good start for you.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Kids always have fun here. Great for a hike or just hang out with the kids. Nice place to hike and have fun for kids. I think I will have my son's birthday here in the summer.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,I love exploration park! There's a huge playground area  an area with super green grass where you can picnic or even run around or just relax after hiking nearby! Very short and easy hike... Very kid friendly hike. My dogs love it here and so do I!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Several trails to climb the peak  covered rest stops at top  great views  lush greenery  playground and water park.   Doesn't seem like much when driving by  but once you take the time  there's plenty to enjoy. Restrooms  shaded picnic areas  great big grassy space  smooth wide sidewalks and plenty of dogshit bags. USE THEM. You know how monkeys like to throw poo...  Love walking the dogs up  over and around. You will too. Bring water for your dogs  if not for you  on the climb. Water fountains located at restrooms and playground. Free parking and security on patrol.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Love all of the different areas of this park-splash pad  big hills and grassy areas  great for birthday parties and play dates  wonderful hike to the top of the hill in the back of the park. Great shade
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Love this place  I only I wish balloons and radios were outlawed here. There is plastic crap everywhere and hard to find a quiet place to sit. Fantastic view from the mountain  and interesting foliage.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Overall a nice park. Perks: water/play fountain for kids (can get pretty crowded); a long trail around the park and a big hill with dirt paths to climb; a big grass area; they often hold event for holidays. Bummers: gets too crowded; not enough picnic spaces; gets trashed (literally) on the weekends.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Great Park...my daughter never gets bored here. Could easily spend hours here. Grat walking/jogging path and the small mountain thats there is a fun little hike. Makes you feel accomplished when you make it to the top get ready to feel the burn. Run up that mountain and you get an amazing leg work out. I'm going to take my dog for a hike up it soon as it cools down. Its short enough that you dont get too tired yet high enough that you get a little workout. They also have a water area there so the kids can play and keep cool. My only complaint is that they dont have enough swings. The park is HUGE yet they only have two big kid swings and two baby swings. They need to for sure put in maybe 2 or 3 more sets of swings that would make it complete.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,This is one of the coolest parks in town and has all the amenities of big playgrounds for kids good areas for barbecue and picnic's parties etc. etc. then you have large grass areas to play sports or just to hang out and a volleyball court.In the summertime at the playground they have water that pushes up from the ground for the kids to play in and if that's not enough there's a side trail to climb and hike mountains edge mountain
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Wanted to do something different for my birthday morning and catch the sunrise. I didn't want to travel too far nor do an extended hike; luckily  my 9 y/o niece told me of a hike she did with my sis-in-law and my mom. Heck  if they could do it  I'm sure I could.  My roomie and I came here with his dog. And it was a great hike.  Nice view. Pretty easy. And close to home.  The park is  also  a great looking park with different themed places for kids to play at.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,New comer to Vegas and this was the first time attending this park. It was an amazing work out! Glorious views of LV. Will go back before it gets too hot.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Itty Bitty Exploration Park Review  Wheee!! This park is cool because you can hike up to the peak and see some awesome views of the valley from the top and it only takes about 6 minutes to get up there. You can follow the trail straight up and there are little rest huts along the way  although it's not really strenuous.  Located right off of Blue Diamond Road  the park itself is pristine  with a great playground for the kiddies and the cleanest park bathroom I think I've ever seen. Check it out and get ready to take some pictures at the top!
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,My favorite park in Las Vegas. There is hiking  an open play area  water feature and lots of green open space. I love that there is always a security guard on bike. FYI  Parking can get crowded on the weekends.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,SHOELACE MOUNTAIN.  So I am a Vegas native and grew up in the area of this park. My husband and I grew up calling the mountain the park is based around Shoelace Mountain because it looks like a big shoe. Anyways  It is so nice to have such a well kept  interesting park near my house. I love to take my dog up the hiking trail all the way to the top. The top has a great view of the Las Vegas Valley and is great to just sit and ponder life. The trail itself is a little over a half a mile round trip. There are a couple of rest areas in case you get too hot or winded.   The rest of the park is great for families. I don't have children but the playground is always full of children and families picnicking.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"I just love this park Period! There is always security roaming around the park  the grass is always green. There is  a Trail you can take all the way up the Peak with a gorgeous view of las vegas  there is a little ""western playground"" for the kiddies  or the young at heart  like me =) and  yes there is a little water fountain park for the kids! You can even bring your dog!! Love Love Love it!!!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,"If you love the outdoors  playground and picnics  this is the park for you. The only thing it lacks are spots for the athletes  so no tennis or basketball courts or areas for other organized competition  but plenty of wide open spaces  equipment for playground jockeys and trails for those that just want to jaunt around outside on foot or bike. For the kids  in addition to some super fly playgrounds  they have the always popular water feature  so bring your swimsuit. I also read that a journey to the top of ""Exploration Peak"" will provide you with a nice view of the Vegas Valley  but it was either too dark or I was too lazy to hike up. Overall  though  the park felt clean and refreshing  must have been all that grass. I would definitely return for a park adventure!"
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,By far the best park that I've been to. My daughter loved it and there just so happened to be a community yard sale going on while I was there! It was huge! My daughter loved it and so did I
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Really cool park. Nice green grass and playground equipment  grass volleyball and walking sidewalks.  They have lots of pet waste stations with bags and doggie water fountains but no fenced in dog park.  We found an empty patch of grass with no one near by to let our dog play fetch and the rent a cop came and yelled at us.  If they take his salary and build a dog park five stars for sure.
Playgrounds;Parks;Active Life,Love love love this park. I just recently moved into a house just up Gomer with my boyfriend & it is so convenient to take our little girl to have some fun! I love that there is so much to do for her & a nice grass area around back. Also made me feel safe to see security walking around! So glad to be living over here!
Golf;Active Life,can't park in the lot after hours  private property. FYI It gets busy in the day . haven't gotten the chance to step inside and see what  its all about yet.
Golf;Active Life,Although they just punched the greens and sanded them....the layout is nice....I will be back to play it again in a few weeks...I will have an course conditions update!....some people throw out hate  but I always give it a second chance!..talk to ya later!
Golf;Active Life,Very nice course. Very well maintained. Beautiful scenery. Staff was friendly. Very reasonably priced. Had an amazing time.
Golf;Active Life,No  no  no  no no!!!  No water except on jug on each nine. Saw cart girl once in four hours. Greens are terrible. Bumpy  no grass  poorly maintained. I'd never play this course again
Golf;Active Life,This course is behind Sam's Town Casino  in a golf course community.  There is a security guard to let you in.  A female met me at the bag drop area  and took my bag.  I made my way into the pro shop  and they sent me out to the driving range to loosen up.  I was paired with an 83yrs old man  who refused to join any group with a female. After he hit each shot  he ask me where his shot went. This senior was a regular  the starter knew him  and I felt like I was basically put with him to be his seeing eye dog.  The course was in very good shape.  Traveling around the course was a bit of a pain because you are constantly crossing roads in the development.  The greens were in very good shape. Most of the holes were well laid out.  The sand traps around the course were in terrible shape  most of which were packed down and like hitting off pavement.  The course was pretty jammed packed throughout the whole round. Most of the holes were pretty wide open off the tee. There were only a couple that you had to worry about water hazards.   The beverage girl came around twice. The second time  she was out of Power aide  which I thought was pretty silly  but ok.  Overall  not a bad course  but I probably wouldn't play there again  since there are so many other great courses in the Las Vegas area.
Golf;Active Life,This review is for the club house and all the wonderful staff that participate in the party planning committee.  One of my dearest friends had her wedding there.  They were beyond accommodating to all the bride's needs and to the bridal party.  They worked with her long distance ( San Diego - Vegas) and always made her feel at ease with all the planning.  They put up with all our shenanigans during rehearsal and took ALL of the different opinions into consideration to come up with a solution that made most of us happy.  There is a lounge- suite that they let us use to finish getting ready and it was very useful. It was a rainy weekend so everyone's hair was a mess and we also had a baby to accommodate.  The ceremony was held inside and they also have a setting to have it outdoors.  Not sure if they have different options as far as to open bar and food goes  but whatever my friends choose it was great! It was open bar! Great drinks and beer selection. Food was also good.  Entertainment was phenomenal!!! Dj was right on point with the music.  Overall these people will make sure that your event goes smoothly and that you have nothing to worry about.  It was a lovely and fun wedding.
Golf;Active Life,Wherewere the tee markers?  Guess they removed them for oversee ending.  We got lost several times and played the wrong hole.  No directional signs leaving green to tell you where the next hole was.  Frustrating!   Also the kid at the cart return was snotty. Poor customer relations.
Golf;Active Life,"Good atmosphere. Staff was nice. I mean  it's a golf course lounge that's not a true golf club.  I was very underwhelmed by the ""Asian"" salad. Chopped iceberg  crunchy things  smoke flavored chicken and Asian dressing. C'mon  at least chop up some purple cabbage and throw on some sliced almonds for some color and added texture. I hear the fish and chips and sandwiches are good. I left off one star because they don't serve breakfast during the week."
Golf;Active Life,i'm sure this course would be more enjoyable if the grass wasn't frozen over like it was when we played. payed a hefty sum to play ice hockey. that's what we get for going in january and at the crack of dawn. i don't remember the course much  i think i was still half asleep.
Golf;Active Life,Golf anyone? Ya  gotta love golf. This is a well maintained golf coarse  not too difficult  if you have a clue as to what you are doing. Beverage chick is pretty cool as well. Carts are in good repair and the clubhouse is big and clean  pretty good food too..
Golf;Active Life,Love the course conditions here which get the high rating.  The staff is friendly and the clubhouse bar inviting.  Layout can be a bit confusing the first time but great variety of holes make for a great experience.  Greens are usually fast and true.  Only complaint is there starter set up never works  they always seem to forget my group.
Golf;Active Life,"I played this course today and have played in the past as well. Today the course was in excellent condition  the grass on the tee boxes was a little long and some is the sand traps were not taken care of ( hard and wet )  but the fairways were in great condition as well as the greens. Now I know everyone says 4 to 4 1/2 hours is an acceptable time to play a round of golf but I don't agree with that  anyone can easily shave off an hour at least if they just played the game and acted like they were pros. It took our group 4 1/2 hours to play 18 holes today and on a few tee boxes there were two to three groups backed up all because one group ahead of us had no time management or common courtesy to move along at a quicker pace  they would wait until the group ahead of them cleared the green before teeing off and from the way I saw them hitting the ball  there was no need for them to wait  there was also no marshal on the course to help move along play  I know my group can and has played a round in about three and a half hours and we are not rushing at all. It's just a sad state that someone  somewhere said it should take that long to play a round and so people make it take that long and I have noticed that the more people that watch golf on tv they try to mimic their favorite folders by doing what they do  it's just sad to see that it's taking longer and longer to get in a round of golf and the courses don't and will not do anything to speed up play. I have a few favorites in Vegas I play weekly and I will stick with them because the play is quicker  players know they are not pros and never will be and just want to get out and play  and the courses are in great shape all year round  but I'm going to keep those my secret as to not get the hackers that think they are pros out there and mess up that good thing  and they treat you better than these other "" golf clubs"" ever will. As for stallion mountain  I will not go back anytime soon  until they get people there that will make it a more enjoyable round and for the love of all that's right SPEED UP THE PLAY PEOPLE."
Golf;Active Life,Definitely need more help in the bar.  Poor CJ is running his butt off.  But good food.
Golf;Active Life,An alright course  but a waste of time if you want to really enjoy what LV has to offer.  Decent clubhouse  course is in decent shape - but very flat and very uninteresting.    Cost is fair  but again I'd rather pay $20 more for something much  much better.  A great back and forth muni  but I really can't give it any more than that.
Golf;Active Life,just played there  10/3  was over seeded  so greens were a bit slow and scraggly  but also played there in July  so mostly the course is great  design  staff  fairways  except right after they over seed
Golf;Active Life,I had very low expectations for the price we paid for a round of golf here.  The golf course itself was just fine  not bad... Not great.  However  I was APPALLED at the cleanliness of the golf course. At first I was disappointed with the incredible amount of  bird poop on the course  but that was something I could look passed.  A few holes in  I noticed a dead bird in the middle of the fairway.  Again  one dead bird... something I could look passed.     By the end of the course  I had seen 5-7 dead birds! Just lying right there on the green!  On a few occasions it was obvious that they had been dead for DAYS!! In the time we were there  we saw a few men mowing the lawns and taking care of the course and I can not believe that nobody took care of this.
Golf;Active Life,the staff was great. the course was in very good shape after reseeding. the greens were in awesome shape. very consistent. I will definitely play here again since my daughter lives nearby.
Golf;Active Life,I have never played Golf here  this is for the County Club  I looked to see if there was a way I could have done a review for just the country club and it doesn't look like it.  For work  I often need meet places around town  I have used Stallion Mountain County Club a few times.  It is nice  and you can hear people talk and isn't super busy like Starbucks.  The food is a bit overpriced for what you get  but then again it is a county club  so I am not knocking any stars off for that. However the service is spotty  I have been there a few times  GREAT service  where as other times it just sucked. Once it took almost 45 minutes just to pay the check.
Golf;Active Life,"Very disappointed... The ""security"" guy just waved at us - we could have been axe murderers or something!  When you enter the facility  the grass areas on both sides of the roadway have no grass (the grass has been allowed to die and just become dirt).  There was trash scattered around here and there  and weeds everywhere.  Looks like a section 8 housing complex. VERY POOR first impression!  The greens were hit-or-miss  some were great and others sucked.  Carts decent  beverage girl was pleasant.  Could have gotten a better experience elsewhere  but if you're looking for cut-rate prices  this is the place.  Overall impression: MEH."
Golf;Active Life,"Stay away from this goat ranch!  For some odd reason  the staff thinks that their course is in ""great condition""......it's not!  It looks more like a very average muni!  We were in Vegas from out of town and arrived 30 minutes prior to our tee time at 11:00.  The pro shop told us that they were running a few minutes behind......which was actually 30!  The pace of play is very slow and the price was ridiculous."
Golf;Active Life,Played around noon in Saturday3/28.  Staff was great  warmed up on range with Grass! Charged $49 with cart which was very fair especially for walk up.  4 hour round. I would highly recommend this course  fair  decent condition considering drought  some challenging holes on a resort course. Shot placement important on some holes  but the occasional golfer will have fun too. Ill be back next time im in Vegas
Golf;Active Life,Held a tournament there on Saturday.  The greens were rolling true and are probably the softest greens I have seen in town (my group plays at a different course every month in the area).  You could shoot right at the pins!  The rest of the course was in great shape as well.  Stallion has an excellent practice area where you can hit balls off the grass and work on your chipping  bunker shots and putting.  The food is great and the service is friendly and fast.  Outside Services as well took really good care of the group  they really know what they are doing getting the bags in and out.  Had a great time and am rebooking for next year right away!
Golf;Active Life,We use to play this course a lot because the rates were reasonable and the condition of the course was pretty decent.  We played yesterday and the course conditions were marginable for this time of year but the attitude of the some of their staff needs attention to courtesy and training.  It was suggested we play elsewhere because of the way we were playing.  I guess business is so good they can be selective about their customers and disregard some common courtesy.  It's pretty clear our group of 8 will probably do as they suggested and  take our business elsewhere.
Golf;Active Life,this course was pretty uninteresting  but not bad.  though expensive overall  it's not too bad for vegas  so if you're blowing your golf budget elsewhere and would like to get an extra round in  this might not be a bad choice.  however  with paiute being around the same price  i'd recommend hiking out there instead.
Golf;Active Life,Paid ~$50 from golfnow.com under hot deal.  The course is a flat land course with some strategic water locations.  Its not one of the longer courses  but the layout is interesting and keeps you alert.  Fairways are decent  tee boxes could use some TLC  but the greens were in good shape (probably running 8 - 9).  This course isn't as scenic as Badlands or TPC  but it won't eat up all your balls either.  A good beginner course for out of towners  but don't play slow or you'll get ran over by the locals.
Golf;Active Life,I played Stallion Mountain on a recent trip to Vegas at the recommendation of a friend who lives in town.  The course is an easy 20 minute drive from the Strip.  I'd call the course or check their web page to get directions as my car's navigation system took me to a back gate where I needed a code to enter.  Luckily  a resident of the community was exiting and gave me the right code.  I was immediately met at the bag drop by an attendant who directed me to parking and the pro shop.  I booked as a single through Golfnow.com and paid $90 for the round  plus $4 for a warm up bag of balls.  The starter was very attentive  pointing out my cart partner  directing me to the range  assuring me that I had time to warm up etc.  When it was time to tee off  he led us to the 1st tee and hooked us up with the other two folks we'd be playing with.  Overall  I found the staff to be attentive and helpful.  The course has a good layout  letting you use every club in the bag.  It is mostly flat  with strategically placed bunkers and water hazards.  If you get off the fairway  you'll be in desert  but should be able to find and play your ball.  The greens are undulating and have some subtle breaks.  My only qualm with the day was the condition of the course.  Given it was April  I expected the course to be in really good shape.  However  the fairways and greens were a little spotty.  I am willing to pay Vegas prices for golf  but for $90 in the springtime  I expect better conditions.  Also  some reviews have mentioned dead birds on the course.  I did see one on the 13th hole  so apparently they have not solved this problem.  Overall  I enjoyed the day.  Props to the staff for their focus on customer service.  I'd give 3.5 starts if I could  but the course conditions make me rate this a 3.
Golf;Active Life,This review is for the clubhouse.  We attended a craft faire here and went through a guarded gate.  The golf course looked really nice with some water areas which would be good for some interesting golfing.  The clubhouse was beautiful and the rooms the craft fair was located in was very nice.  We didn't eat at the restaurant this time but will in the future.  What I didn't like was when walking into the women's restrooms it stunk so bad.  The garbage was overflowing and none of the sinks had soap.  I would think when they have an event going on they would have someone keep up with housekeeping.  Stench and no soap really turned me off.  My husband wants to come back and try the golfing since it is opened to the public and we will write a review on that when this happens.
Golf;Active Life,If you like to get a quick round in at an affordable price Stallion Mountain Golf Club is your place.  Don't forget to stop by the Grill for a great snack.
Golf;Active Life,Don't particularly care for this course. For one  the layout is flat  relatively uninteresting  not optimally designed and littered with many visually unappealing telephone poles. Plus  the course offers few scenic vistas and has undesirable features not typically found elsewhere (e.g.  a service road that doubles as a cart path and a small concrete structure adjacent to the fairway that comes into play). Second  it's in an older part of town  which is a little run down and looks less than safe. Third  some of the holes are actually quite dangerous to on coming car traffic. This is a liability risk  just waiting to happen. Fourth  for a so-so course  it's pretty crowded and the pace of play is slow. This course has seen better days and I'm not too sure what the new owners  OB Sports  can do to spruce it up.  I'm not too positive that they can do anything about this in the long run.
Golf;Active Life,Two stars is pretty generous  as the greens were in the worst shape of any golf course I have ever played.  Not one was in good shape; they were sanded  but much worse  had multiple dead spots on every single hole.  The breakfast burrito in the restaurant was also disappointing  with the fattiest flimsiest bacon I have ever eaten (and no potatoes  but that happened at another place and maybe that is the crazy way they do things in Vegas).  The people were nice enough  and the course was in ok shape other than the greens  so those are the only reasons I am not giving it one star.  Also  its a $30 cab ride from the strip.
Golf;Active Life,Course is old but not bad for the discounted price .... Long straight drives  I would play there again for 20$
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,I came here for a girls spa day... It was great experience. The massage was so relaxing and and my nails was shaped exactly the way I want!  Everyone was friendly and welcoming. Will definitely come back for another girls spa day ...oh and don't forget to ask for Tina! She's excellent!
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,I decided at the last minute to get a pedicure and I felt lucky to find this salon without a wait on a Saturday! I picked my color and was seated right away.   I got the regular pedicure for $25 because it hasn't been that long since my last  so I felt like I didn't need the other stuff. My nail tech offered me something to drink and got to work. One thing I really liked was that they have a book of toenail designs that you can look at while getting the pedicure. They have very cute designs available!   They have online appointments available  which I love! Everyone was friendly and the salon was clean.
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,Love this place! Staff is accomodating and very pleasant. Ask for Lido!!  Their prices are reasonable  and they do a really good job!
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,If I could give them zero stars I would. Went in to have my sport length nails protected by gel manicure with a pink and white polish. Came out with short short nails with no polish.  My nails are now rough and bumpy and 10 times shorter than when I came walked in. Asked for a French pink and white. Fluorescent pink and terrible tips later I had the manager remove everything and walked out.
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,I stopped into the salon to get a quick manicure. I have a regular place that always does a stellar job  but this was closer and I was short on time. I was initially pleased there was not much of a wait  but I wish I hadn't stayed.  I picked my colors (I picked a sparkling Polish for my ring finger) and waited. The gentleman who came over brought sanitary tools out of a package  however he cut me three times  didn't get all the dead skin from the cuticle  and then used a file for acrylics that had obviously been used on someone else on my natural nail to buff them. This is after he cut my very long very oval nails almost off and filed them round. My nails grow fast  so I didn't make a fuss. Someone walked in for a pedicure and he quickly tried to finish up before he left my nails unpainted to go to the pedicure.  Another gentleman sat down and started to paint my nails. I had to explain three times the very common paint job I wanted. He kept looking at his iPad in the drawer. When he stood up to thin the sparkle polish with acetone (which is a major no no for longevity of the polish)  I saw he was playing an online card game! You couldn't hold off for 5 min to paint my nails properly? I asked him repeatedly to paint to the edge of my nail. He never made it.  Another customer walked in saying she had been there from the previous day and wanted her nails filed down to what she had previously specified. He told her they were too busy and to come back tomorrow! She said she'd never be back  and I was already thinking the same thing. He continued to play the game until a regular walked in. She was greeted warmly and I was all but forgotten. He quickly finished up with me and walked away. As she sat down  I heard her tell him that the top coat he used last time had peeled off the next day. My experience combined with the two other complaints in such a short time assured I will never visit this salon again and I'll advise that none of my friends do either. Not a happy customer!
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,My friend and I wanted a gel manicure. The young girl butchered my friends nails(worse than a nail biter) then she asked for pink n white french(there name is pink in white). Ended up hot hot pink the white was horriably crooked she stoped the girl and the guy that did my nails wouldnt give us any options but to take it off. 2 hours later my friend walked out with super short nothingness ! My nails are incrediably bumpy as I told him while he was doing it he proceeded to tell me it wont be there when the top coat goes on! Well I have brail on my nails! There were also very short with us. And you could have heard a nail drop  no music no tv just pure silence for two hours!
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,I wanted to do a last minute gel mani and pedi because I was going out of town. But I knew the moment Peter was done with my ombre gel mani I was not going to get my pedi done. I was very unhappy with how the ombre turned out but I wasn't going to write a review instead never get my business again. Unfortunately 1 week later my gel polish came off so here I am. It is definitely one of the worst nail job I've ever encountered  what a waste of my time most importantly my money... Never will I return or recommend this salon to anyone... What a horrible 1st time experienced here  they should really work on giving some customer satisfaction somehow
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,Had gel removal & manicure. They did a great job & were so nice. Thank you to them!:)
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,Absolutely the WORST pedicure. The tech was falling asleep and yawning. No massage or scrub  they really don't know what they are doing! AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST!
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,Took my middleschool-aged daughter here the Sunday before the first day of school.  We have seen this place in our neighborhood and decided to give it a try and let my daughter get her nails done as a special treat before school started.  I was a little worried based on some of the reviews I had read  but we had an awesome experience.  She got a manicure  with 3-d bows (one on each hand).  It was so cute.  Mia was the person that worked with her and she was very nice and did a great job.  I believe we got a discount - $20 total before tip.  I will definitely go back  it is nice to know that we have a place in our neighborhood that is reasonable and does a great job.
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,"If I could give no stars I would. This place sucks. Literally. Being in the service industry I know what it takes to have business and a business that works . I'm surprised this place is even in business. Rude techs   the guy that was doing my nails was playing poker on his iPad while doing my nails... or should I say the ""free iPad use for customers"" I came to this place because I was in dyer need of my nails done. Since my last set were very old. My normal spot was closed and this place seemed convenient for being open late. I got a full set pink and white powder with gel top coat on October 6th... in the last two days my index finger on left hand and middle finger in right hand both nails popped right off. The rest of the nails are lifting so bad and there is a hole in the powder on one of the nails. I understand that in a week an acrylic nail is going to grow out a little bit. But it should not be lifting this bad! Anyways I went to my regular place and My fixed my 2 nails that this place did such a horrible job on. She pointed out how bad they were lifting and was shocked when I told her I got them a week ago. Told me to go back and show them as did I   I walked in to the guy playing poker on the iPad and showed him my nails   he told me he wasn't going to fix them and shrugged me off. They have a sign in their establishment that says 10% off any service for regular customer. You don't gain regulars by poor service and no accommodations when your guests are spending a huge chunk of their money for your services. Whether you like it or not in any business the guest always comes first . Because in reality that one person will tell one other person about how great of an experience they had or how horrible of an experience they had and well you can figure out the word of mouth from there. Never going back to this place nor will I ever recommend it. Poor poor poor service !"
Waxing;Hair Removal;Nail Salons;Skin Care;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service,"I walked into this place on accident. I normally go to Angels nails on Jones. And when they were full I was looking for diamond nails  but for some reason siri took me here :-( I really needed a color change/fill and a pedi so I figured why not.  The pedi was OK  the man gave a great massage but his toe nail painting was a joke. Sooooo sloppy! Even after he tried to clean them up when I got home I realized I still had red all over my toes.  Next was my finger nails omg....I've never hated nails before normally im easy to please but this was ridiculous. I asked just to have a fill and color change but the girls mentioned my nails were crooked? I hadn't noticed because I thought they were perfect  but im not the ""professional"" so I assumed maybe she saw something I didn't? But she totally changed the shapes on my nails and did it sooooo bad. My nails are a mess! They are terrible and one is so crooked im ashamed. I have to go back to Angels and have them fix this 100$ mess! Never again. 100$ for sloppy toes and even sloppier finger nails."
Permanent Makeup;Beauty & Spas;Skin Care;Eyelash Service,I waited over an hour and Yesenia was a no show! I had my appointment for 1pm and she never showed up  keep in mind that we also made this appointment two weeks in advanced  also the lady helping us had the door locked so we waited outside for her to open the door and then she said she kept calling yesenia  but they kept talking about problems that they were having. Every time we asked where she was I was told she was on her way. Yesenia never showed  I left.
Permanent Makeup;Beauty & Spas;Skin Care;Eyelash Service,I heard she was good and cheap and booked my appointment with her for a Monday afternoon. They called me when I was on my way to the salon to cancel and changed my appointment to the following monday at the same time  3pm. On the following Monday  the called to tell me my appointment had been changed to 4:30. I arrived ten minutes early and Yesenia did not get there until 5PM. Extremely unprofessional.  Her job was OK  except for the fact that she does whatever the hell she wants with your eyebrows. She would not stop yelling at me  horrible customer service ! My eyebrows are too thin because she refused to do it as I requested and now I have to use make up anyway.   SO NOT WORTH IT. Awful location  horrible customer service and completely unprofessional staff.
Permanent Makeup;Beauty & Spas;Skin Care;Eyelash Service,My appointment  was at 4:30 I got there at 4:15 to be on time but she was not there. I waited till 5:05 and she was a no show and didn't pick up her cellphone either. She didn't even call to apologize. The place is dirty and chairs have cat pee stains. She had some training material laying around on the table and her tools were one time use plastic ones. I would not recommend this place to anyone.
Permanent Makeup;Beauty & Spas;Skin Care;Eyelash Service,I've been coming here for years.... Yesenia is a true professional.  She knows her color  balance and intensity needed for each of her clients.  I've seen many people walk out and I've seen right before and immediately after their treatment.  And Wow! Wow! Wow!!!! And wow!  Yesenia my Love you Rock!
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,The first time we visited it was great. Tonight the planetarium was disappointing. The presentations were blurry and all six of us walked out complaining to each other about the terrible resolution. Too bad!
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,Down in Flagstaff  Arizona  the Lowell Observatory stands as a working monument to the power of a well-constructed telescope.  On many weekends  long lines of star gazers stand in 1-2 hour long lines waiting for a chance to look through a telescope in the observatory where former planet (now dwarf planet) Pluto was discovered.  Well . . . the College of Southern Nevada's observatory is not that observatory.  It's much smaller.  And the planetarium is much smaller.  That said  we all know that we sacrifice some things to live in Las Vegas.  One of those appears to be a spacious planetarium and strong academic interest in astronomy.    But I don't fault the CSN planetarium for that.  In fact  it's a really nice place to have in a public-funding strapped state like Nevada.  They offer some great programs on how to identify stars and seasonal programs discussing special events in the stars.  It's a good educational early evening event for families.  And  an underrated and imaginative idea for the beginning to a date night.  And if you head there on a clear night  the observatory may offer you the chance to look at a planet through one of their larger telescopes (well  larger for Vegas).
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,I've seen some pretty amazing planetariums  so this was definitely smaller than I expected.  Not terribly impressive  but my kids thought it was absolutely amazing!!!!  The first reviewer  in my opinion  was completely unfair.  1 star?  Really?  You've been twice  the first time was great and the second time they had technical difficulties. Hardly fair to give them a single star for that.  I would think that at least merits 3 stars.  It is  after all  a publicly funded community college in a state that's been strapped for cash for several years now.  I'm grateful they have something like this here in Las Vegas.  We went there during Nevada Science Week and got to meet some professors and the folks who operate the observatory and planetarium.  Thank you for having a good science department at your college  and thank you for participating in NV Science Week and allowing families to visit and enjoy for free.  My kids are in love with science  and my oldest wants to be an astrophysicist when he grows up  so we appreciate every opportunity to encourage his interests.
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,Came to see the Maya Skies show on a Saturday at 8. The planetarium is pretty small (been to a much bigger one in Idaho) but without support how could they ever get bigger and better?  The show was really cook but admittedly is was hot as hell in there.  I suggest bringing a travelers pillow to take strain off the neck.   The show itself is pretty cool. You learn quite a bit and at the end we got out to go see Saturn :).   Would suggest.  Adult tickets are $6 i think.
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,Went there in a School field trip with my kid. This is one of Vegas' hidden treasures. It's not big and its not as sophisticated as NY or LA  but iy is clean and well-maintained. They have shows for almost every age range.
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,Pretty cool. Capacity of planetarium is about 75 people so on the smaller side. Good for adults and kids. They also have a star gazing program after the shows. FYI you might get motion sickness.... I did! No barf bags included
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,This is the worst experience EVER ! My boy is 10 years old was looking forward to this place all day we finally got there and it's so incredibly hard to find we were 10 minutes late and they would not let us in !!!! don't waste your time and gas money !
Planetarium;Observatories;Museums;Arts & Entertainment,Great host. Loved going to the late show then after he took us outside to look through the telescopes at the moon and Jupitar.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,One of the banks im with. its a bank. they have an ATM  and tellers. Nothing special. but not horrible. Friendly good service.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,Probably the dingiest US Bank I've ever been in. There's a security guard outfront  which lets you know right away you are not safe. The staff is rude  and has dirty looks stuck on their faces. Odd how they can afford a security guard  but they can't afford a public bathroom for the customers that keep them in business..?? Being a businesswoman  the place honestly offends me as a whole. I will never be back again.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,Used the atm on a Monday night.  No problem.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,This location was always quiet every time I went  so you can avoid waiting. One teller whose name is Sherry knows what she is doing. You will get the best service. Thank you Sherry for improving a quality of teller's job.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,Kathy is a sweetheart. She always welcomes people walking in and takes her time in dealing with any issues customers may have. I was worried coming to a new branch because I had built a relationship with the employees in Los Angeles  but Kathy and Tara have made to switch worth it.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,US Bank is the worst ever.  I am old enough to have had several banks over the years  and still have two others.  I can say without qualification that USBank is simply awful. First  I attempted to set up a new checking account online. I authorized transfer of funds from another account.  My credit is over 800  so no problems there.  I simply never heard back.  So a week later  I went in person to open an account.  That went well.  The representative was very nice. About a WEEK later customer service called to let me know that my online application had been approved.  Of course  it was needless then  so I declined.  After all  who waits two weeks to let you GIVE them money. Next problem  I wrote a check on one of my other accounts to deposit into this one.  Bad idea.  They had told me a one day hold on deposits. Turned out to be 8 days so far. The check cleared by other account seven days ago.  Still  USBank has failed to make it available to me. I could understand if the check were drawn on John Doe with the Bank of Nigeria.  Instead it was drawn on my own account and was PAID eight days ago today.  Thus I have been unable to use my money  from the other bank and have been unable to use the deposit with USBank.  Oh  I forgot  I called customer service about this problem.  A very nice lady said she would check on it and all me back within 5 minutes. That was four days ago....still no call.  USBank has zero customer service and may have claim to being the worst bank in the country. However  I have only banked with twenty banks or so  thus I cannot confirm the right to that title.  RUN DON'T WALK from this institution.
Financial Services;Banks & Credit Unions,Monday at 11:30am this branch had only 1 non-teller employee to assist patrons. We waited 35 minutes and left.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Opening caveat  I am just realizing that I need to take the Yelp categories more literally: three stars is A-OK  and that's what I'm giving Little Tony's; my previous reviews of other restaurants suffered from grade inflation....  In terms of Little Tony's  we had a perfectly good meal late last night. Service was attentive  from both the server and the manager. And prices were good: we happened to arrive late enough to benefit from the nightly happy hour from 10 p.m. until closing. In terms of food  the meatballs were FANTASTIC. Tasty and HOT (temperature-wise)  with plenty of red sauce. The calamari was edible  but much too large and rubbery for my tastes. The 9"" New York-style New Yorker pie was acceptable. Too much crust and not enough gooey  mozzarella-y  tomato-y middle for me. That may be in part because when I lived in New York City  no pizza place served 9"" pies; there was always tons of middle relative to crust. Still  Little Tony's 9"" New Yorker was dry; it tasted good  but it wasn't an East Coast  tri-state area pie.  I think that's just the problem with having lived in New York City: when you leave  you judge pizzas (and bagels!) by degrees of disappointment. Eating at Little Tony's  you will leave well fed  but you will not leave thinking you've had an out-of-body-experience that landed you in New York."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Tried it for the first time. I was greatly impressed by the pizza I ordered. It was a hand tossed pepperoni pizza. I wish I could order one here at home in LA.  My husband ordered the spaghetti with meat sauce and meatballs. He wasn't too happy with his dish  I loved it and ate most of his. They serve their pasta Al dente. Which I love  but since my husband doesn't care for it that way  I never get to have it my way. My dining guests ordered the calzones and was pleased with theirs. The service was fast and very friendly. Since I always stay at the Palace when I'm in Vegas  I'll be back eating at Tony's again.  I'd recommend the restaurant and it's menu greatly.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Food = good...Manager with the beard and bald head = Jerk. Pls go somewhere else. I love Tonys and have been to mothership in SF...superb. That said  there are far too many winderful pizzerias in LV to waste your time and money with this mook.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Delicious! Excellent menu. Food was amazing. They do a lot of their food from scratch. Well priced. We had great service. Would come back again!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,First time here at Little Tony's and I cannot wait to come back! Amber was our server and she was amazing! We had the Tartufo pizza  sausage and peppers   and spaghetti and clams! Everything was perfect! But most of all we were excited with the extensive whiskey/bourbon selection at the bar!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Little Tony's is probably the best pizza I've ever eaten.  Enough said.  Chicago style pizza located in the Palace Station Casino.  This is the only thing it doesn't have going for it  but it's definitely a hidden gem in Las Vegas and not to be missed. I'd vote it's cab-worthy from The Strip.   Full service bar as well.  Decor is great  but recall  it's located in a casino; not what you'd expect. Service just ok  but all can be overlooked once you sink your teeth into their pizza!  Can't wait to get back to Vegas and mostly to see if this will be as good the second time around.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,What a great little secret. Little Tony's is an exceptional deal for the price. The dishes are large and can feed more than one person. I had the bruschetta which said three people as an appetizer. The pizzas were done perfect  they were fresh  hot and the crust was light and bubbly.The cheese did not overpower  nor did it smother the other ingredients  The help at little Tony's was exceptional. I took a soccer team with 40 people to their establishment and they handled it perfectly. The service was excellent  the food was excellent and the price for the meal was exceptional.Little Tony's is great little place to visit  Ihope you enjoy if you go.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,had a groupon for $50  went with buddy to try it out sat a bar  was actually happy hour  great deal on top of our groupon!  started with calamari  was ok  would probably pass on it next time also had meatballs  a bargain at a buck apiece! thought they were pretty good  will come back for them again can make a meal out of them and a few beers!  my buddy had the lasagna  said was pretty good I had sausage and peppers  was happy with that dish too!  unfortunately the meatballs and calamari were pretty filling (in addition to a few beers!) so ended up boxing sausage and peppers for lunch next day  guess this place replace the old pasta palace  which was no loss.... saw few other people taking advantage of groupon or living social deal too! many sat at bar and had pizza  which I will have to try next visit ....only so much you can eat in a visit!  in any case  when the line is too long at oyster bay  this place definitely worth a shot! appreciated them accepting groupon for happy hour too! thanks guys  look forward to next visit!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I have eaten here twice. Very basic overpriced Italian restaurant. Service is average  the employees are pleasant  and the place was totally dead on a Friday night. I guess we will see how long the Hotel subsidizes this average restaurant.  Subway is next door  I wish we went there.  There full service bar is reasonably price.  The chicken Alfredo is delicious  but they don't make a pizza.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Just paying our bill...first time...sooo good...cute atmosphere...lots of TVs to catch the sports...yet subtle music...good lighting and yummy fresh food! The Caprese salad was big enough for two and delish...as was the appetizer garlic bread...we both had pizza and it was bursting with freshness...parm cheese on the table...love that! And our server  Marcus was so hospitable...we would come back just for him. So  in a nutshell...food and service were beyond refreshing!!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My husband and I just got done having dinner at Little Tony's it was the absolute best and our waiter Paul was such a fantastic waiter   very knowledgeable of the menu  and very helpful. It's rare to come across good service at a restaurant. Thank you Paul for the great service and hospitality we will definitely recommend little Tony's.  The Welch's
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My husband and I love the pizza! We get the St. Anthony's and it is amazing! We tried the whiskey hot wings today and they are delicious! Staff is always friendly and drinks are good! We will definitely be back     
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This is in the Palace Station.  The food is outstanding.  There are no sides so if you want garlic bread it is extra.  The portions are BIG.  You will not leave hungry.  I ordered the lasagna with Alfredo sauce.  It was Devine.  Howard had the chicken parmesan.  He devoured it. The pizza looked and smelled wonderful.  I ordered Tony's Tiramisu  Malibu rum infused lady fingers  shaved valrhona chocolate  showered in frangelico.  Yummy!  Run don't walk to eat here.  You will love it.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Had came to Palace Station for The Oyster Bar  but the line/wait was just too long and we were on a time crunch to catch our Book of Mormon show in downtown.  So it was pretty much between pizza or the Chinese fast food next door.  It was about 11AM and the place was pretty much empty other than another couple and a solo diner... I guess it was too early for pizza for everyone else.  Not for me though!!  We ordered the Chicago style deep dish... I forget the name  but its the one with ricotta and meatballs.  Also to make me feel less guilty  I also ordered the caprese salad. The waiter had quoted about a half hour wait for the deep dish pizza to be ready as the dough takes a while to cook.  And exactly at the half hour mark our pizza came out.    I'll start with the meh.  Caprese salad  not that it was disgusting  but it was probably the most boring and least tasty of caprese salads I have ever had.  I was expecting beautiful  juicy tomatoes on a bed of salad greens (the menu said there was greens) with creamy mozzarella layered in between.  No  there no real substantial bites of tomatoes  but more greens and peppers in the salad.  The mozzarella was bland and just blah.  Yes  blah  thats the word that comes to mind when I think of their caprese  blah.  Deep dish pizza came out piping hot  with a tasty  crispy crust.  Better than BJs deep dish  reminiscent of Golden Boy in SF.  One slice and I was full.  I wish the meatballs weren't sliced so thin as they got kind of lost with the sauce and everything else.  Ooey gooey cheese  theres no such thing as too much cheese in my book  especially if it's ooey gooey!  We weren't able to finish the pizza  so ended up taking the rest of it back to our hotel room.  Usually  I love cold pizza  hot  cold.. makes no difference to me!  However  this style isn't the type that can be enjoyed cold like your regular crust pizzas  so that was a bummer.    Overall  I'd come back for their pizza and a different salad next time.    ***I have never tried authentic Chicago style deep dish pizza before  so I have nothing to compare this to!****
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Pizza Rock is cool  but Little Tony's is even better! I know they have the same owners  but there's just something about this little spot inside of Palace Station. Maybe it's the soft serve ice cream? They have more of a homey feel and I think the service is a bit more personalized too. Their deep dish pizza is spectacular and I've tried pizzas from NYC to Tuscany. Similar to how Oprah LOVES bread  I LOVE their pizza.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The BEST gluten free pizza I've ever had!! The crust is amazing and does not taste gluten free at all! My husband tried it and loved it too! Little Tony's is located inside the Palace Station Casino a little off strip but is worth the cab for this pizza!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Was really looking forward to trying out this place and giving it Chicken Parm Test.  You can easily judge a true Italian restaurant by the quality of the chicken parm they serve.  Plus I love chicken parm!  So I show up last night around 8:30pm while some UFC fight is on the TV at the bar.  Well the host is so involved with watching the fight he ignores me standing right in front of him at his stand for a solid 5-10 minutes.  Finally I decide to just seat myself.  I already had the feeling this wasn't going to go well.....  I wait another 10 minutes sitting alone at a table in the middle of the restaurant until a waiter asks me if I need a menu and a drink.  He takes my order for a diet Pepsi and hands me the menu which I wanted to look through even though I knew what entree I was ordering.  I considered a salad or appetizer but decided against it because I remembered reading other reviews saying they give you a complimentary pasta fagioli soup.  I got my diet soda right away  but it was too sweet and FLAT.  The waiter comes back a good 10 minutes later to take my order.  So I order the chicken parm and he tells me ""sorry we're all out of chicken parm"". Well....so much for that!  I will not be back based on the service and general atmosphere of the place.  Can't explain why but it seems very harsh and not homey despite the booths lining the walls of the place. Maybe it's the brick walls with high ceilings and bright lighting."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This place was good. We were influenced to come and try this place out through Groupon... And we weren't disappointed.  We made reservations for 9 and waited a while to get our table set up.  FOOD: The appetizer was delicious. Ordered the meatballs and the sauce they came in was fantastic.  The cesar salad was pretty decent too.  The cheese that was in it was a bit over bearing for me  but then again I'm not a big fan of the smelly foot cheese.  For the entree  I ordered the parmesan eggplant !!! It was my absolute favorite hands down!!!! Last we ordered the Milligan pizza (???? I think that's what it was called) Chicago style.  Let me tell you that it takes about 35 minutes to cook this bad boy and once you see it you'll know why.  Its a super deep dish thick crust !  It had a strong flavored cheese on it that I wasn't too crazy about  but then again I'm a plain Jane kind of gal.  I tried my son's simple pizza which including pepperoni and sausage toppings and that was tasty too.    In all  it was a good experience.  If you guys are at place station  this is a yummy place to stop by and try.  Go and see MICHAEL R.! He was a good waiter.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Food is amazing all made from scratch right down to the sausage and pepperoni. This restaurant takes authenticity to an entirely different level for restaurants. I am sure more awards to come for  best Everything.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Reviews are opinions and this opinion is bay an Italian New Yorker living in Las Vegas. After 5 years I have given up trying to satisfy my palette with a great pizza. Instead I amuse myself by gambling on those opinions and editorials I read in local publications. All in all I can recommend better places to get a bad pizza!  My expectations at Little Tony's was low and I was not disappointed. Out of 3 pizza's ordered only one was cooked correctly. My pizza had a relatively thin crust and the dough was cooked. The other two pizza's we sampled  were thick crust when it said it would be thin  but worse then that they were both under cooked. There was nothing to WOW about as far as pizza is concerned. Service added to the bad taste in our mouths and when a manager stays away from your table because they know they didn't represent the restaurant well  Then you know why at lunch time there were only 3 tables occupied. Try Russo's where an Sicilian makes the pizza right in front of your eyes! (PS he's off on Tuesdays)
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Tartufo pizza was great! Loved the idea of a complimentary soup to start. Service was ok but random and a bit distracted. Would be interested in going back and trying again though
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We really enjoy the fresh menu options. The thin crust is my favorite. The cheese options are complimentary to the sauce options.  If you love Pizza Rock  this will be a favorite too!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The New Yorker is fantastic.  I have had it several times now.  They got rid of the JERK  with the pony tail that was the lead bartender a while back and the atmosphere is much much better now.  I would highly recommend and the value for your $ is great.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Visiting Vegas for the week. We like to dine off the strip. Little Tony's was not far so we decided to try it. Great choice! The server was excellent(Michael). We had the calamari appetizer the Cal Italia pizza Spaghetti Bolognese Mud pie for dessert. The pizza was the star! The combination of cheeses  fig  prosciutto was delicious. Followed closely by the mmm mmm meatballs. So good the meatballs were not heavy very moist great seasonings. I would have given a 4.5 if possible  not a 5 only because the first time the calamari was brought to the table it tasted like it had been cooked in oil in which other food had been burned. However  a new plate was brought out promptly and it was cooked perfectly. Very light coating and calamari sooo tender. Well worth it. Make this a must go destination. You won't be disappointed!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Looking for that delicious Pizza Rock pizza but don't want to deal with the large amounts of people and the crazy wait times  BAM!!  Everything we ate was delicious  and service was excellent.  A great alternative to Pizza Rock!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I love this place the food is amazing the vibe is awesome!!! My servers chris and Amber were great! Also the bar staff was excellent!!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Had dinner here for the first time. Food was great  calamari was excellent as was my lasagna. Our server Chris was very accommodating and knowledgeable too.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Excellent service  great Caesar salad  lasagna and spaghetti with meatballs.  The free bread with olive oil and balsamic vinegar is awesome!  Amazing Italian wines for 29 a bottle!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Been here a couple times since opening date & the food has been good. This time tried some pasta ordering through postmates for delivery. Lasagana looked really flat but tasted way better than it looked. Mostaccioli & meatballs very good with 3 large meatballs. Forgot to take pics because we were really hungry but will have again! postmates was awesome!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Been to pizza rock  and really liked it  but we hate going downtown  so we wanted to try little tonys  because its the same owner and the food is the same   and closer to our house  its in palace station casino  which is kinda weird  its not the best place for it  but  we really wanted to try a different pizza so we didn't mind  don't let it scare you off that the place is not busy  we went for lunch  they have booths and tables  we got a comfy booth   there was only one server  but only one was needed at that time  he was great  and since we have eatin at pizza rock we already knew what appetizers we wanted  we got the meatballs  the SAUCE IS AMAZING!! and we got truffle French fries  I got them well done because I had gotten the gorgonzola fries at pizza rock and they were soggy  so these turned out perfect.  and then for lunch we got the station pizza  had red sauce  with lots of different meats and veggies on it   it was  a fairly thin crust  but it held up well to all the toppings  and they don't skimp on the toppings   but the pizza's range about 20 and up depending on what kind you get. they have deep dish as well  so give this place a go  you wont be disappointed!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"I wanted to try Little Tony's based on Yelp reviews and one in the local paper.  I wasn't so sure I was going to be a fan because  unlike other Yelpers  we weren't as blown away by Tony's flagship restaurant  Pizza Rock  on Fremont.  But we were pleasantly surprised.  Loved the fact that they were open late  and also that there was a Happy Hour in progress  so we saved a few bucks on our drinks and food.   I had the St. Anthony 9"" pizza  a white pie with mozzarella and sweet sausage  red peppers  ricotta  and basil.  It had quite a kick to it  and I loved it.  The wonderful surprise was that it was CRISP  which was my complaint with the soggy Cal Italia pizza I'd had downtown.  Our terrific and friendly server  Alexis  explained why Little Tony's does a crispier job with the 9"" pizzas.  It was filling  too  so I managed to eat only half. It made a great breakfast the next morning!  Hubby  remembering how much he enjoyed the meatballs at Pizza Rock  ordered a four-bagger - for $4 HH price! - and a side of veggies to put them on top of.  And since he'll be fending for himself while I hit the road  he ordered another portion to stick in the freezer.  Alas  it was the end of the culinary road  and only three remained in the kitchen  so they were gifted to us.  I tried to take pictures of my beautiful pizza  the big bowl of veggies  and the warm and inviting atmosphere  but as it happens way too often  Yelp was ""a bit funky right now "" and I couldn't post or even save them to my phone.    But there'll be a next time  and I hope to be able to capture them then."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,just had a Michigan ave pie with my wife... UNBELIEVABLE.... BEST PIZZA IN VEGAS!!!   WELL worth the trip away from the strip....
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Palace station now you have 2 bomb eateries in you. Found this place on groupon  wow. So impressed. Excellent cust service from the moment my wife and baby stepped in. Nice waiters  hipster bartender made great drinks and the Dillenger pizza ... Best Ive ever had and Im a man who loves my piZza. Will def be back. They have 1 big screen at the bar  great for watching games. The best
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The caprese salad was yummy & the basalmic dressing outstanding! The mozzerella and pepedew peppers took it up a notch. We also had the ranch pizza  hawaiian (don't think it's called that) & a pepperoni/ sausage pizza. Loved them all! My favorite was the ranch! We had some extra dressing to dip the crusts in.  Our waiter (also the bartender) was wonderful. Friendly  attentive & knowledgable. Did not expect much inside Palace Station  but this place hit it out of the park!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Went last night because it was 1/2 points if you pay the bill with points.   There were 3 tables with customers at them and I feel we had to wait a little too long to be seated considering they were empty.   We ordered 2 pizzas.  We ordered a small NY style New Yorker $9 which was good  but I hate their sauce.  Way too sweet.  But as a compliment the homemade ricotta was outstanding. The crust was good.  Next we ordered the Old Chicago deep dish and it was awful.  First  the crust to me was identical to Pizza Huts deep dish pizza which I don't like.  Then the overly sweet sauce.  Very little cheese  meatball or sausage.  And it was $26.  The best part of this pizza was again  the homemade ricotta.  So for 2 people  drinking only water  bill was over $40 with tax and tip.  Then we pay with our points  and it did not show up a 1/2 off.  We were then instructed to go to the players club.  After walking all the way over there  we had to wait in a line for 15 minutes.  The woman who helped us first said there was no 1/2 price points when I had to show her the sign right in front of her face showing that it was.  So after about 10 minutes with her and getting things kind of fixed we had to go back to the place and give them what the players club gave us.  I think they should have done all this for us while we sat and perhaps were given a complimentary dessert for the long wait and inconvenience.  To sum it all up. not great customer service  and deep dish pizza over priced and not very good.  High marks for homemade ricotta. Went back today  about 2PM.  1 other table taken.  Ordered the Manhattan calzone and NY Pizza.  Calzone was very good.  It had meatball  ricotta and motzerella.  The pizza was just OK.  Crust was soggy.  Toppings/ingredients were excellent.  If only I could put Grimaldi's crust on this pizza.  Overall  I give todays visit 2 1/2 stars.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We just dined in and we used a goupon and we were not disappointed. The groupon says it's $50 for 2 ppl but there was 4 of us and they didn't care.  The pizza was delicious. The same chef/owner from pizza rock from downtown.  We will be back. FYI they have a $1 soft serve come special. Get it! It's Delicious!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I have been a regular at Pizza Rock since they opened and consider it one of the best in Las Vegas. But Little Tonys is nowhere near the quality and taste of the original. The salads and starters   like the calamari  are very good. But the pizza   in my opinion is no better quality than a first rate frozen. They are poor copies of the original and anyone who is a Pizza Rock fan will notice it at once. Too Bad.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My wife and I went for an early dinner to avoid the heavy crowds and unfortunately that didn't matter. The waiter was very helpful in finding a wine to try and letting my wife try the sauce on the dillenger pizza (pizza had good flavor but a touch spicy and a bit over cooked  if it wasnt for the extra sauce we would have sent the pizza bavk) to see if we would like it. However he only checked on us once early on in the meal. We were told the dillenger pizza would take 30 mins. Which was not a huge deal because we order a salad to start (the caprese salad  salty but not bad)  however we waited almost 20 min.after our drinks were empty And I had to flag down our server. By that time we were ready to go and very aggravated.  Now I understand you get busy but we were not the only table to have that issue and he had to walk by our table everytime to fill up other customers beverages and orders. My wife and I would love to go back to try other pizzas they offered but after the poor service and over cooked pizza we won't be back. We also had a groupon so I don't know if they felt the wouldn't get tipped well so they didn't try very hard and that's why we had poor service but whether you have a groupon or not we tip based on service so I guess food for thought  just because you have a child with you or a groupon or both shouldn't be a reason for poor service. That's coming from experience.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"It's 4.5 star food  but I have to give it a 1* so that hopefully someone like the owners notice this because it's a problem that needs to be addressed.    First the pros:  I go here all the time  but not anymore since I can only go during the day for reasons explained later.  Best Sicilian slices you will ever have.  I love the sauce and how they will make the pizza however you want it.  I have had slices  specialty pizzas  and calzones  all of which were phenomenal.  The bad: the girl who works there usually at night has the worst customer service attitude and skills I have ever come across.  She screwed up my order horribly  but I am very understanding and was like  ""no big deal...it happens.""  However when I brought it to her attention she gave me a dirty look and didn't say a word  not sorry  or anything.  Later on  another patron sitting next to me comments how the attitude of her and other workers was really bad. His words were: ""These are some real attitude having MFers here.""  So I bring this up to someone who knows the restaurant.  I used to work at Palace Station so I know who to talk to.  I find out that she is married to the regional manager of the restaurant and is best friends with the manager  and was told based on that I could forget about any complaint going anywhere and the best course of action is to write a Yelp review.  So here you go...  Update:  One of the owners was very responsive and assured the issue had been resolved.  I went back the next night for more outstanding food (best pizza in Vegas).  The service was great as I was fortunate enough to get a great server who was polite  professional  and did an outstanding job.  Hopefully this doesn't happen again  but if it does  I will be sure to Yelp."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Extremely disappointed in the new menu. We have been here several times in the past and enjoyed the 9""pizza option that allowed us to try several speciality pizzas. They have eliminated a couple appetizers as well as small portion of pasta. Disappointing to say the least. We won't be purchasing anymore Groupon or living social deals that used to make for a great evening out."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great pizza. Great service from our server Paul  and best of all a huge whiskey selection!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,North Beach SF grade pizza in Vegas. AMAZING! Gotta try the Jalapeno Hef beer too. So good!  I found the place via Living Social which is always a gamble  but this time it was a big win.  The staff is super friendly and knowledgable of the owner's other restaurants. The decor is so cool. I felt like I was in New York.  I had my three sons with me and they always go for a pepperoni. They loved it. Thin crust and the cheese and pepperoni are so flavorful.   My boyfriend and I ordered the Don Giovanni pizza and it was perfect. We also had the mixed greens salad and it was great. I enjoyed the picked sweet peppers in it. It was unique and tasty.   For dessert we shared a tiramisu which came in a small mason jar. My boys and I couldn't get enough.    This was our favorite meal in Vegas this week. Affordable  family friendly and good eats.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Very good Pizza.  Very good service. Got The Station which is a classic American. Coming from Connecticut and working out of New Haven I'm sometimes hard to please with pizza. 5 star pie with possibly the best crust I've ever had. The bartender Michael is very friendly and can answer all questions. All in all the mixed greens and cherry salad  the station pizza  and the service were all five-star
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Fantastic pizza and a haven for those who are whiskey connoisseurs. Extremely great service and awesome decor of a speak easy feel
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Little Tony's is located inside Palace Station  in case you're trying to find it. We also found out that this is a sister restaurant to Pizza Rock from downtown (cool! We like pizza rock!)  It's a small little place  pretty cozy  but cute.  We enjoyed the El hefe on draft (from banger brewery downtown!) and started with the meatballs. Those were probably the highlight of our meal. The meatballs were delicious  made from beef  pork and veal  but that sauce really kicks them up a notch.   For our main  we shared the Dillinger pizza. It's a deep dish  topped with chicken  onion  artichoke hearts  three different cheeses (so it says  but I couldn't tell if the cheddar was on it) among other toppings  but it didn't have sauce. The first few bites were delicious  but that's about all I could have! The pizza is hugeeeee and trust me  we've had our fair share of deep dish pizzas  but after it was all said and done  we decided it was just OK. Maybe the staff hyped it up for us  maybe we believed it when it said it won best pizza in 2014 or maybe we are just being too tough on them? Either way  it wasn't our favorite.  Although  I would prefer to go to pizza rock over Little Tonys  it was fun to check out palace station for the first time.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,2 adults and 2 teen boys all enjoyed food and service. Had meatball sub  chicken parmigiana and fettuccine Alfredo plus family Caesar salad. Didn't try pizza but wish he had!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Have eaten once at Pizza Rock and then heard this place was a sister restaurant.  Decided to check it out so I didn't have to drive downtown and put up with the parking there.    The decor was very nice in comparison to the casino and not as kitschy as Pizza Rock.  I sat at the bar and was able to ask the bartender to change the TV over to the football game I was interested in watching.  I was there around 11am and while the place was not busy  the service was good.  The menu was an abbreviated version  but thankfully included the ""New Yorker"" pizza.  The pizza was very good and at $17  it was much cheaper than the same pie over at the Rock ($25).  I don't know that I could tell any difference.    If you're staying on the strip  I'd say Little Tony's is worth the short drive for some good pizza."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Love this place  terrific pizza and wings! The rest is probably great too I just can't ever order anything else. Best in Las Vegas!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"My expectations were set pretty low in terms of Little Tony's. Since I haven't found great pizza yet in Las Vegas  I was expecting another decent but not delicious place. I... I was wrong.   Little Tony's is inside the Palace Station Casino  a little ways off the Strip. You have to navigate your way through Palace Casino to find it too  so expect some walking and bumping into people in the narrow walk ways between slot machines. Enter Little Tony's! A hostess station and a bar greet you  with a large dining area with tables & booths beyond.  We were sat at a booth and our server came to take our order. They were running a special where you get a 9"" pizza and a soda for like $6 or something crazy like that. We each ordered that: She got her's just plain cheese while I got mine with pepperoni & black olives. Our pizzas arrived shortly thereafter  looking delicious! After pulling out the first slice and taking a bite  I was very  very happy. The base/bottom crust of the pizza is pretty thin  just how I like it  piled with sauce  cheese & toppings. It was very tasty. Even when it came to the crust  it was absolutely tasty. I'm going to be honest...they had some other stuff on their menu but I didn't even glance at it. I wanted pizza and nothing else. And pizza I got. And pizza was delicious.   Our server was really friendly  though maybe a bit tired of dealing with people all day. Nevertheless  she was nice and got us our food in a timely manner without any issues. Our bill for both of us was less than $25.00. I'll definitely be back. Delicious pizza at an awesome price? Eff Yea!!!"
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Delicious place inside the palace station casino. The meatballs are great  must get when visiting. The bbq pizza had a unique flavor. Overall this place is great to visit if nearby.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"We came here for dinner. Kids eat free on Wednesday's. That is even better for us since we have a 4 year old daughter that loves pizza and spaghetti. My daughter was given crayons and a menu to color on.   As we entered  we were seated by the waitress. I like the decor inside (see my photo). It is kid friendly. Our waiter came by to give us menus and took our drink orders. I ordered an iced tea while my daughter had a pineapple juice.   We ordered a couple of happy hour items which were the three meatballs in a garlic pasta sauce. So garlicky and good. Meatballs were soft and flavorful. Next were the garlic Rosemary fries which were bomb! The fries were crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. You can taste the garlic and rosemary. Perfect blend of flavors. I can eat this all day. Finally we ordered a 9"" The Station pizza which consisted of small pepperoni  mushrooms  yellow peppers  olives  ham  small cherry tomatoes cut in half  etc. The pizza crust was crunchy and fresh. The ingredients were fresh which is how a pizza should be made. I was impressed with this place. The waiter refilled our drinks. I definitely enjoyed my food here.   Service was great and I enjoyed my meal. I definitely recommend this place if you crave a good pizza and spaghetti."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Found this gem from Groupon! Amazing food and service. Homemade marinara sauce  pizza dough  bread..everything! A sister company of Pizza Rock. We had the Margarita pizza  spinach and artichoke dip with sourdough garlic bread  whiskey bbq chicken wings  lasagna  and shrimp fettuccine Alfredo. The service was also great. Always topped off our drinks asked if we were okay and friendly. Definitely a must try! We'll be going back!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Go and get the St. Anthony Pie.  It is delicious!    I have tried many of the other pizzas and they are all good.  Room is nice and casual feel.  Good wine and beer list.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great service/good pizza/great crust/great lasagna.  Portions were large and they have a good drink menu with lots of choices.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Two stars for food  but service was great. If you look at my pictures  I'm a badass foodtographer  so my photos do the food way more justice than it deserves - trust me  it looks WAY better than it actually tastes.   Truffle fries didn't look that great  but the truffle smell permeated in the air  so I still had high hopes...worse truffle fries I've ever had. Not that it was disgusting  just not very good at all. Definitely wouldn't recommend. Although I'm not going to lie  everybody thought it ended up being the best part of the meal.   The Dillinger takes 30 minutes to cook  so be sure to order as soon as you know you want it. Ours actually took longer than 30 minutes  but okay. I honestly do not understand what the hype is about. I love deep dish pizza  but this was like eating a dense piece of bread with all the toppings. My friends compared it to eating a week old baguette or wheat thins except thick. It was just really dry  dense  and hard to eat. I literally only took two bites out of my pizza and my boyfriend forced himself to finish one whole slice (we were all super hungry  but I just couldn't). I usually never try to get food taken off the bill no matter how bad it is  but my boyfriend doesn't like to pay for food that he has to try and force himself to eat. The manager came by and asked us what was wrong with it and it was so bad that we were at a loss for words to even try to explain. I felt super awkward because I didn't  want to seem like an asshole  but it was really bad. The manager did take the Dillinger off for us though  so that's a plus.   We also ordered the St. Anthony's but substituted the sausage for chicken and added an egg (for an uncharge). The chicken was so dry  it was legit dehydrated chicken. My friends said that it was just like the chicken they buy for their cats.   The Californian was okay to me. My friend who ordered it thought that it was super greasy. I thought it was definitely better than the other two (which still isn't saying a lot).  My friend ordered the spumoni   which I thought was okay. She said this was the first time she has not enjoyed spumoni because it tasted weird. I think spumoni always tastes kind of weird though  so I wouldn't know.   The mud pies were okay to me as well. Everybody else said it tasted frost bitten  but I only took a small bite  so again I wouldn't know. Definitely not worth $9 a slice though.  Long story short  we wouldn't ever return here for their food. Although our server and the manager was great  we all would have rather had some Pizza Hut or Tostinos.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This place used to be amazing.  5-star amazing.  Used to be.  Prior to August 1st  this restaurant was owned by the same people who own Pizza Rock - and had the same homemade pasta and delicious pizza at a much cheaper cost.  It was our hidden gem off the Strip.  As of August 1  2016  Stations Casinos bought the restaurant.  The menu has changed  the pasta is no longer homemade  the meatballs are not nearly as good as they used to be  and prices have increased.  The service is good  of course  and the people are friendly.  But I'm giving Little Tony's 2 stars because they used to be one of my favorites and now my disappointment is crushing.    So to everyone who's been here before -- it's not the same.  It's not even close to being the same.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We ordered the Old Chicago and the New Yorker. Great pizza  cooked well  nice thin crust on both. Not sure we are fans of the dollops of ricotta piped on after the pizza is cooked  we had to spread it around so we werent eating a big lump in one bite. It worked out ok. The calamari mild and spicy were both great. Service was attentive and friendly. We used a Groupon  we feel it's overpriced   just dont get $20 for pizza. We probably would go back for happy hour or for the board specials.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Most amazing Pizza I've had here.  Old town Chicago Pizza is amazing and will not be disappointed.  Cute and super polite waiter/bartender to boot. He's a keeper and gives good recommendations.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Since I still haven't properly tried Pizza Rock  or any of his other restaurants for that matter  this was my introduction to the cuisine of the famous Tony Gemignani. It was certainly a good first impression.  With a rapidly expiring Groupon to my name  I arranged to meet a couple of friends here for an early dinner. While I was waiting for them  I noticed that it was the tail end of happy hour. Upon inquiry  the host informed me that they do honor happy hour pricing for Groupons. This unexpected surprise bode well for the night.  After my friends arrived  we got seated. We were shown to a booth  having been indecisive with the choice between that and a table. This was great. I felt comfortable because of the cushions below and behind me  but they were actually very unobtrusive. Moral of the story: go for a booth if you can.  I appreciated the decor  with the retro faux brick walls and the clean  modern black table tops meshing well  and the good lighting allowing us to eat with our eyes first (and take photos of course). They have plenty of TVs and they were almost all tuned to the Thursday night NFL game  which was a nice plus for two of us fantasy football managers.  Anyway  I seem to have digressed a little. The food was great  and stacking discounts made money a forgotten issue at the meal went on. (Quick note: I didn't go for the alcohol tonight  but during happy hour  well drinks are $3  draft beers and wine by the glass are $2 off  and specialty cocktails are $3 off.)  We definitely ordered every happy hour appetizer  and then some. The Classic Meatballs ($3 HH for 3 meatballs) were moist  tender  and savory  with a nice pool of sweet tomato sauce lending more flavor but not covering up the meat at all. The Calamari Fritti ($5)  which we had in a traditional style  came with a marinara sauce and a spicy calabrese sauce  the latter of which was the more interesting of the two even if it was starting to edge into too-spicy-for-me territory. The Garlic-Garlic bread with cheese ($5) was tasty in the super-cheesy middle sections  but got a little boring at the ends.  I think I had the most mixed feelings about the Italian Fries ($3) They have four different types of fries  and although we skipped the Truffle fries and Gorgonzola fries  we did go for the Rosemary Garlic fries and Honey Pancetta Parmagiano fries. I'm a little sad to say that  although the fries are nicely crunchy outside and fluffy inside  they're clearly under-seasoned. The Rosemary Garlic fries merely have ketchup to help cover up this flaw  and I left those alone after a few bites. However  I really liked the other variety because the honey  pancetta  and parmesan stacked sweet  smoky  and savory flavors (note: add more cheese from the parmesan dispenser if necessary). I just wish that the foundation was solid.  Because 9"" pizzas were $2 off for Happy Hour  we felt more comfortable sampling different varieties instead of going straight to the higher value 16"" pizzas. My choice of the New Yorker ($8 HH)  per another friend's recommendation  was a nice meaty pizza with pepperoni  sausage  and dollops of ricotta on which I probably should have used a knife to spread out a little. The ricotta definitely added an unexpected dimension. The Tartufo ($10 HH)  a white pizza  had some nice touches from the light truffle oil and goat cheese  although I would have liked just a bit more prosciutto. The Quatro Formaggio ($8 HH) was a nice combination that didn't have me missing the cheese at all  aside from the rather pronounced crust on the edge. Speaking of which  I never skip the crust anyway  but the dough was delicious on all of the pizzas - crispy and crunchy in just the right amounts.  I should also mention that our server was friendly and engaging from the moment we entered the restaurant  building a nice rapport at least with my more sociable friend. He had a nice sense of humor and wasn't too intrusive  haughty  or whatever issues you might have. He even left me something interesting on my phone when he borrowed it to run the Groupon voucher... nah  just kidding on that. It was a nice joke though.  It wasn't perfect in every way  but my experience at Little Tony's left me wanting to return  especially for the fries with honey and pancetta. And the excellent meatballs  of course. Actually  I should finally check out Pizza Rock now since its Green Valley Ranch location is closer to me. Besides  it's probably gonna be a while until the next Groupon."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Food: Great Service: Not  Food is fine  the atmosphere was relaxing. Our server forgot to bring out napkins and silverware. Granted most people eat pizza with their hands. I had the bourbon bbq pizza. Having a napkin and silverware at the ready would be a nice option.   The floor directly beside where I was sitting  needed to be mopped ! Quite a few times staff members  including management  walked directly over the dirty floor. The floor was dirty before we were seated.  Just not acceptable.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Good food awesome staff... They are kind and helpful but it may take a while if they get busy worth the wait have patience
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Cute Italian place. Pizza is good! My fav has been the Diaviola. Very conveniently located near Sportsbook. On Saturday they have a great "" date night"" special; salad  large pizza  dessert  4 beer/wine for $50. I like this place better than the sister chain Pizza Rock."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Had dinner last night with my husband after the UFC fight.  First we waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged.  We were getting ready to leave when we finally got asked for a drink.  We stayed and I wish we didn't!  We had the New York Pizza and it was the worst pizza I have ever had.  We got soup and bread to start with and that didn't even taste good.  The soup was cold and all broth with a couple of noodles and 2 beans.  The bread was sliced so thin you can see through it.  The service is horrible.  The manager came and asked how things were and we said it wasn't great and she laughed and walked away.  She looked like a slob for being a manager with jeans and a causal shirt.  The table next to us ordered a deep dish pizza and the server brought it out burnt!  She just told the people to try it.  As you can see we were not impressed with this place.  I will not be going back and I will make sure people we know don't even waste money going there!  Pretty sad when you wish you ate at McDonald's!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great meal for a great price. Server very attentive. Loved the cheesy garlic bread and of course the pizza.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great pizza spot! The complementary soup is a nice touch. I ordered a Caesar salad and the Dillinger. The pizza was a beauty and absolutely worth the wait. Soooo good! I also had the tiramisu for dessert. It came in a cute mason jar but was a very thick consistency and tasted like straight sweetened condensed milk. Too sweet for me and not quite what I expect. They also have happy hour from 3-6 Monday through Friday and from 10 to close every night!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We read the Yelp reviews and bought a Groupon coupon to give it a try on our trip to LV. It is in the Palace Station Hotel/Casino.  We ate a late lunch/early dinner at 5 pm on a Tuesday and we had our choice of tables.  From the Yelp reviews we decided we had to try the meatball appetizer.  5 STARS.   3 large meat balls for $5 and the sauce was mopped up by the bowl of fresh bread.  So good.  My wife is an Egg Plant Parmesan snob.  She rated this as the best she's had in years.  The waiter recommended a side of pasta and sauce as the entree is a la carte.  The pasta was equally delicious.   5 STARS.   Where we had a departure from perfection was with the Chicago style pizza.  Ordered a Michigan Ave. pizza which had 3 cheeses and house made pepperoni  tomato sauce and a deep dish crust.  All of the toppings; sauce  pepperoni and cheese were wonderful but the crust on the bottom was probably 7/8 inch thick and so overwhelmed the toppings the pizza seemed dry.   We wish we'd have ordered a NY style.  The pepperoni is apparently homemade and is peppery and wonderful.  3 STARS.   The service for drinks was very slow when there wasn't food being brought out.  The thick pizza took 30 min. and our drinks were dry for 20 min. after the appetizers.  The casino atmosphere is not optimal but the restaurant itself is very nice  quiet and tastefully decorated.  They have a sister restaurant - Pizza Rock in old LV a block north of Fremont.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Do not eat here.. Terrible food.. Lousy service! Told the waiter three times we did not want to be rushed.. Empty restaurant so no reason. Food came out while we were still eating our salad. Waiter did not even get my husbands dinner order so shared my entre with him. Ordered s bottle of wine and waiter just poured it without even offering us a taste first. We were comped desert which was the best part of the meal.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Had to try the pizza Champs pie. Went for lunch and found out they have some great specials. We ordered two of the $8 1 top pizza with salad and drink.  Awesome deal! You get and 8-9 pie that is hot fresh and bubbly cheese.   The salad was great. Nice bit of spring mix perfectly dressed with halved grape tomatoes and slivered purple onion. The dressing which I am assuming is house made ranch  was very good.  The Pizza also was very good. A real hand toss dough with a light tomato sauce with real mozz cheese  no fillers here. The cup n char pepperoni was perfect and I love that flavor you get from this topping when the edges start burning and curling up. AWESOME!!!   Overall great food experience. Service on this visit was ok. Nothing spectacular. I felt ignored for a while but the place was pretty empty. I WILL be back soon to explore the menu more.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Have now been there 4 times and every time has been great!! Easily the best calamari I've had in Vegas!! The pizzas are dynamite and the wait staff has always been professional and courteous!! The best part of Palace Station is this gem of a restaurant!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This Italian restaurant located in Palace Station casino was fantastic.  I ordered the lasagna  which had a healthy topping of cheese  and the sauteed mushrooms as a side item.  The whole meal was excellent.  The service was friendly and the atmosphere was inviting.  The lasagna was filling  with a perfect assembly of pasta  meat and cheese.  The restaurant wasn't really busy the day I visited  so my meal came out quickly.  Even if you're not staying at Palace Station  you should visit Little Tony's at least once and try the lasagna.  It'll be worth it.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My friends and I ate here the night before Superbowl 50 .... My buddy recommend simple Spaghetti with its 3 meatballs .... Awesome recommendation .... May have been the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever eaten .... I don't remember better ( l really mean it ! )  .... That order with a nice chianti / great service made for a wonderful Saturday evening .
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Ordered the chicken Alfredo. My husband got their pasghetti & meatballs.. Food was ok our waiter was extremely friendly & helpful.. However prices were way to high for such a casual place. Chicken was good but somewhat dry.. Spaghetti was good but not enough meatballs. No soup or salad came with our meal like most places..our meals were like $15 each.. Way overpriced.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great build your own Old Fashioned and don't miss the Meatballs they are perfection.  Family size portions are available and the prices are very reasonable.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Nice atmosphere. Good pizza and nice service. Not impressed w the pasta. Calamari was good.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Ever had a ""mouth-gasm?"" I have. And it happened after I ate the pizza from here.  Little Tony's is the sister restaurant of Pizza Rock  with a smaller menu and without all the craziness. It's hidden inside Palace Station and I can only assume that it's not busy because most people don't know it's there? Well now you know  you're welcome!  We ordered some food to-go for my brothers birthday dinner. We originally were going to dine in  but my grandma has a hard time walking and we figured it would be better to eat at home. Unfortunately because of this  most of the food was cold when it arrived  but even cold that shiz was delicious. Here's what we had:   -Meatballs -Baked Salsiccia- Baked Mostaccioli Pasta  House made Fennel Sausage  Ground Beef   Garlic  Light Tomato Cream Sauce -Cheese pizza -New Yorker Pizza-Tomato Sauce  Mozzarella  Sliced House Made Sausage  Pepperoni   Ricotta  Garlic  Oregano  Oil -Old Chicago Pizza-Tomato Sauce  Mozzarella  Provolone  Sliced Meatballs  Fennel Sausage  Garlic  Ricotta  Romano  and Oregano -Pepperoni Pizza  I really enjoyed everything  but my favorite was the New Yorker. This pizza had delicious slices of pepperoni  sausage that's made in house  and dollops of fresh ricotta cheese. I could not get enough of this pie and while eating it  I wish it didn't have to end. The flavors on this pizza were unlike any I have had before. Pricing is a bit on the $$$ side  but I think it's worth it. They use only fresh ingredients and some items they only make a certain amount of per day. My family seemed to enjoy the food as well  commenting that it was different than what they are used to. They are from Chicago and loveeeee their pizza. There was so much food we had leftovers for days. Let me tell you that I hate leftovers but I gladly ate the leftover food from here. It was so good. I literally can't wait for my next meal here."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,If you happen to find yourself in Palace Station  then go here!  I love Pizza Rock  so I expected to enjoy this place and I did. A bonus is that you are able to get smaller versions of their pizzas here.   The Whiskey Wings are right up my alley. I love saucy wings that are a mixture of bbq and spicy. Total personal preference and I really dug them. Also came with a side of blue cheese which is always how I consume wings.   Ordered the picante and the tartufo pizzas. Really enjoyed the fun flavor combos of both and the crust had a nice char on both of them. I would say that I liked the tartufo a little better because I am not a fan of sausage and the spicy sausage on the picante pizza was too greasy for my taste.   Only complaint is that I wish they had more beers on tap  although they have a large bottle/can selection to make up for it.   The service here was fantastic. We always had people checking in on us. Our server  Mike  had us laughing the entire time.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"I am a fan of Pizza Rock and when I had the opportunity to recently dine at Little Tony's  I went for it.  It's a more ""dumbed down"" (I mean that in the best possible way) version of Pizza Rock - many of the menu items are the same.   The decor is much different - this restaurant has large booths and a more Italian feel.  Although we were there on a slow Tuesday night  our service was painfully slow. Luckily we weren't in a hurry and weren't too bothered by it.  We ordered The Dillinger - they only make 10 a day. HOLY COW!  There is so much going on  it's hard to explain  but it was definitely delicious. We also had the honey  pancetta and parmigiano fries  which were tasty  but not as good as the gorgonzola fries.  Overall  a good experience  but nothing I would go out of my way for. It's not often I am near Palace Station  and Little Tony's probably won't change that - but if you are in the area  it's worth a visit."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Totally overpriced and the food is not worth it.  Had the 3 Cheese Burger.  No flavor to the meat.  The bun was tasty and so were the rosemary garlic fries.  We also ordered the Chicken & Shrimp Alfredo.  Did not taste like an alfredo sauce.  Actually had no flavor whatsoever.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Falls far short of his other establishment  Pizza Rock. We have dined here three times  once being delivery via Bite Squad. All three times  the pizzas were very greasy underneath  and the delivered pizza had the wrong toppings on it. As for dining in  both times the staff was cold and unfriendly. I recommend skipping Little Tony's and just head a couple miles east to Pizza Rock.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"I purchased a Groupon for here  and I am extremely pleased with that decision.   I had never been inside Palace Station until I made my trek to Little Tony's. While the decor of the restaurant and the location were not my favorite  I could understand that the restaurant was aiming for a ""classic"" vibe.   Since we had a $50 Groupon  and it was just the two of us  we had to go a little bit crazy. We ordered the garlic fries  the mac and cheese  and baked salsiccia  and a cast iron pizza. The fries were awesome  which you would not expect of an Italian restaurant. The weren't too garlicky  which is definitely a common theme in flavored fries. They also weren't crunchy. I like my fries softer  so this was perfect.   The mac and cheese was fantastic -- al dente and overwhelmingly cheesy. I would not hesitate to order this again.   The baked salsiccia was my least favorite of the dishes. It didn't have enough flavor for me  but I also don't eat sausage. My dining companion said the sausage cased in house was great. I would still pass on this one.  The cast iron pizza was a huge hit. Not too saucy but perfectly thick  cheesy  and salty. At $25  I am not sure that I would come here to get it at full price  but I was extremely happy with it. Our carb overload left me happy as a clam.  The service was also excellent. The waiter/bartender was always helpful  informative  and passionate. He made the experience even better. The restaurant was not busy  and I hear that it doesn't get super busy  but I wish more people knew about it. It blows Pizza Rock out of the water."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,So I suggested you guys should get the Meatball sandwiches and you did it... that is a great way to get repeat customers is to listen to your customers.  I tried the meat ball sandwich and it is GREAT that meat ball with that sauce and cheese... the bread was so soft and perfect.  Can't wait to see what other creations this restaurant comes up with.  I think any great restaurant should have a crave food and I know they are known for there pizzas but I haven't found one person to say that the meatballs weren't great.  I guess what I am saying is that I have found my new crave food with Little Tony's meatballs.  One day I will try the Hot House Made Calabrese Sausage or not order the Cal Italia and try the Sausage & Peppers.  Maybe another dish that can be converted to a lunch sandwich.  Every time I go in the staff gets better and in more synch with each other.  If there is only one complaint is that we had ordered the family Alfredo to take home for dinner after having lunch there.  By the time we got home there was no sauce left it either got soaked up or there wasn't enough prepared with it.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great pizza from this restaurant located off the casino in Palace Station.    It's got the decor of an east coast pizzeria with brick walls and checker tile floors... but it's a tall open space  so it could be a bit more intimate if they really wanted to recreate that ambience.   3 types of pies are on offer... American  New York and Chicago.  I opted for the Old Chicago deep dish...  Wow... Delicious thick buttery crust... hearty toppings... great heaping of sauce on the top... perfect.  I can't claim any authenticIty to you Chicago Pizza purists as I'm no expert  but I can say this pizza was delicious.  Can not wait to return to try a New York style pie!  Definitely worth the slog through the smokey casino if you're in the area and want good pizza.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Service was great! Artichoke spinach was the best but the Dillinger pizza was awesome!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Went there for a quick lunch & it didn't disappoint. We ordered the meat ball appetizer. WOO-HOO!!!!!!!!!!! Out came 3 huge balls & they were done to perfection!!! Tasty. Tasty. Tasty. Can't wait to go back & order the lasagna AND the balls.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The food & service was excellent. We got the Cal Italia Pizza which is the Food Network Pizza Champions Challenge gold medal winner. Our server John was very friendly & attentive. Definitely coming back again.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We came to Little Tony's based on reviews and having read someone's review that it is similar to Pizza Rock.  We ordered the New Yorker and the Bourbon BBQ pizza  meatballs and baked chicken and shrimp pasta.  Everything was absolutely delicious and just fantastic.  The only thing that wasn't good was the bread that came with the pasta and their ice water  but definitely no deal breaker.  The service was on point and the food came out super fast.  I highly recommend this place.  Definitely coming back for seconds.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Was looking for quality Italian food  and we definitely found it here. We were skeptical due to the location but were happy with the results. The service was great and so was the food.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Delicious pizza & meatballs. We were surprised by how good the food was considering we went because of Groupon. Can't wait to go there again when we get to Vegas.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,North Beach style Italian cuisine. We came here to celebrate my S.O.'s sister-in-law's birthday. We sampled almost everything on the menu. The New Yorker pizza was perfect as was the salami and cheese appetizer plate with honey. The homemade sausage is really good too and had the right. When each of our individuals meals arrived they was enough to feed two people each. Our servers were really good to us and they served my friend a slice of Dago Mud Pie and helped sing happy birthday. We could not have asked for better food or experience. Thanks Little Tony.  We'll be back!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Fantastic! I'm writing this review as I sit inside of Tony's  I couldn't wait to say how great it is. The food was great  excellent pizza and the pepperoni was great. Dessert was even better. Kind of an odd location inside the casino at Palace Station but well worth it.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Excellent food and service. Ordered the Dillenger deep dish  honey and bacon fries and meatballs. All amazing and tasty. Micheal was our server. Great guy. I will be back.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Went here with the Fiancee and I haven't laughed so much in my life. That's a good thing though.   The most unfortunate thing about Little Tony's is that it's nestled inside Palace Station. A cool hip pizza joint in the middle of a depressing casino. It's a shame really. It's just like WuHu noodle house being in the Silverton. Not something you expect.  We were seated immediately as the Palace Station faithful were not crowding the restaurant on this night. This is where the night went from good to amazing.  Ordered an IPA and when our server (Mike  which I've been told 3 Mikes work there  but was assured that all the Mikes were friendly) totally biffs it and spills the beer on the empty part of the booth (we did not get spilled on). He immediately picks it up and plays it off. He starts wafting the air and says something to the effect of  ""the aroma is really going to add something to your dinner."" He cracked us up the rest of the night.   I was sold on this place. Our server became the coolest guy in the world. We talked to him most of the night and he was probably the funniest  nicest server I've ever had.   Oh right  the food!  The food was just as good as the service.  WHISKEY WINGS. That's the jam. Mike warned us about the wings. These are wet wings with a heat bite that sneaks up on you. Your scalp will be sweating in no time with these wings. Pain was worth it.  Ordered two pizzas  the Picante and the Tartufo. The Picante is a spicy pizza with both serrano and banana peppers with Cholula hot sauce on it as well. This heat does not sneak up on you as much. It's either you take a bite and it's fine or you get a bite and your mouth is on fire. It was more complicated than just being hot though. It had a ton of flavors going on and the heat added a nice kick.   The Tartufo was the opposite. A more culinary refined pizza with truffle oil  Italian goat cheese and Prosciutto De Parma. This was our server's recommended suggestion. It was a great pizza that you wouldn't necessarily think was a great pizza. Definitely a must have.  I had a great meal with an unintentional show. This is worth the trek through the Palace Station."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The 3 of us shared a Dillinger pizza today.  All I can say is WOW!  That is a great pizza and definitely worthy of the World's Best Pizza award.  There are so many flavors and they all complement one another.  Fantastic bacon wrapped crust!  The menu says they only make 10 per day  so if you get a chance  order it.  I had 2 slices and was absolutely stuffed  but it was totally worth every bite.  Very nice servers and did I mention the pizza?
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Golly. This was the worst pizza I've ever had. They had the most dry pieces of chicken I've ever had to chew on. It crunched when I ate it. I don't think it was suppose to crunch. The sauce was horrid and the combination of the ingredients was even worse. To be honest it was about a month ago and I can't for the life of me remember what I ordered. I know my friend ordered their specialty and there was nothing special about it. They sent it back. Even their simple margarita was lackluster. Mud pies for dessert. Never again. They were frozen with frost bite all over it. I can't say I enjoyed any part of that meal. Oh yeah. Even their Dr. Pepper was weird. It was like not enough carbonation and not enough concentrate. It was like they took Dr. Pepper and mixed it with regular water. Overall I have used this place as a curve when I grade my meals. I always say now. At least it wasn't as bad as Little Tony's.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Amazing pizza and drinks . I had the the duchess and my boyfriend had the Capone drink both were incredible and I highly recommend them . The marinara sauce  is homemade and has great flavors. The service was great and everyone was friendly .
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The atmosphere was nice. Food was yummy. Order was a little messed up  overall waitress was friendly though. Would give it a second try...
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The food here was really delish - but the service not so much.  We ordered the meatballs and then the Dillinger. Meatballs and sauce were super easy as was the Dillinger  although if we had been able to read on the menu that it would take 40 minutes we may have opted for something else. It looked as if they had a manager and 1 bartender on duty. But the barman didn't really seem to know his stuff and was very slow...I have no problem waiting for a drink but I watched 2 older women wait at the bar to place their food and beverage order for at least 15-20 minutes while the server/bartender chatted away with a young woman next to us (maybe his girlfriend?). My husband and I will probably come back some time to try their other items  but maybe not at lunch time.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Really bummed about this one.  I LOVE LOVE LOVE Pizza Rock and Capo's. With that said  I don't so much LOVE LOVE LOVE Little Tony's. We were seated right away  for a table of 10  and the hostess/bartender/waitress (all the same person) was very friendly and accommodating. But  because she was what appeared to be the only server (aside from the busgirl) present or working that night the service was really slow. The food was flavorful  but luke warm (maybe because it sat at the kitchen window for too long waiting to be delivered to our table?). But  what really sealed the rating for us was the fact that not one  not two  but 5 plates on our table and/or served to us were dirty. One of the plates even came with a piece of dried pepperoni attached to it. When we asked the busgirl to bring us some clean plates  and noted the dried piece of pepperoni on one of our plates  her reaction was almost like she was being put out and she certainly didn't seem fazed that the plates were dirty. Not sure we would return. We can get better service from Tony's other restaurants  so why chance this place again?
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Excellent for when you are in the mood for a pizza fix! It's hard to find decently priced pizza  that is good quality  near the Strip  so I was happy to try out this gem. Less chaotic than Pizza Rock in terms of the menu items  so they do everything they offer very well. Enjoyed the selections we made and would like to come back and try some more in the near future.  Almost forgot the rundown! We purchased three 9"" pies for four guys at lunch and we were satisfied.  - The Bronx (9"") - $11 - Pepperoni (9"") - $9 - Picante (9"") - $11  Came out to $33 with the Local's Discount!  Thank you!"
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,New Yorker pizza is awesome as usual.  Fettuccini Alfredo for the kiddos and a plain basil pizza all washed down with Stella Artois.  A nice and easy after work dinner spot
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Excellent food and service. Best Italian cuisine I've had in years. New Yorker Pizza was delicious. Check it out at the Palace Station.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Food was excellent  pizza is definitely unique and was staff extremely friendly  especially John! We will be back
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The food was good and so was the service. Only complaint is they sold the place to Stations and the menu was cut down. The meatballs are gone. The Chicago thin crust is gone. The pizza is still good  but it isn't the same.  If you are nearby  it is worth trying; but I wouldn't go out of my way.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Excellent service food everything!! Closest pizza to Chicago we have found yet since we moved here
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This place is maybe a little shy of 5 stars. Great service. I was very surprised how tasty everything was. The meatballs app was awesome. Me and my gf ordered a few pizzas to try. I was very impressed with the station pizza. It was basically like a supreme pizza with a ton of toppings. Not too heavy and the sauce was not too acidic. I would say just right actually. Cal Italia was good too  but I liked the first pizza better. Had bread pudding for dessert and it was pretty good too. I would come back and try more pizzas  it's a good selection and great quality.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Visiting from out of town and stumbled upon Little Tony's via yelp  and I'm glad we did.  We started off with the meatballs which were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious.   Our table then shared The Dillinger  which is everything I wanted it to be  and we also shared the Frank Niti  which was a beautiful/yummy pizza that the vegetarians at our table could enjoy. The entire staff was super friendly (each of them thanked us on our way out)  and the establishment was squeaky clean. There's no reason for me not to give them 5 stars. Can't wait to come back and try more.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great food. Was with a large group and everyone liked their food. The pizza was outstanding as was the service.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Really good. I would say it's all the good stuff about Pizza Rock  (minus the green beans) without the size. It is small and hopefully a secret that only some of us will know about. I would have liked my drink to be bigger  the food to come out faster but happy it is near downtown without going to the grand and dealing with their parking. Honestly I think this pizza is better! Way to go!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Been hearing about Pizza Rock downtown and this place run by same owners. Just opened  lots of choices of pizzas. Had margarita  small size  tasty topping. Very interesting crust  the bottom was crunchy and stayed like that  never had one like it before. It was good  not the best. Warning: buffalo wings extremely spicy! Had to take of most of the sauce  it was burning and hard to eat. Think beer bottles are overpriced at 7 dollars for Rogue. Service was good  very attentive.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Great atmosphere  great service! Michigan Thin Crust Pizza  Caprese Salad  and Tiramisu are delish! We ordered the Dillinger Pizza  sounded better on the menu than eating it. I would definitely come back again!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This restaurant was disgusting and deserves an audit by the health department  and classes on how to cook. Go somewhere else  as there are cleaner establishments ran by people who know food safety and preparation for better pizza. The staff even had an opportunity to make it better  but were completely unapologetic and showed no sense of empathy or professionalism to the matter; and so pizza lovers and possible lifetime patrons have been lost. It gets one star because zero was not a choice.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Tony's pizza is the best and now I get to enjoy it without having to go to Pizza Rock since I try to avoid going downtown.   I always go for the Neapolitan award winning margarita and a New Yorker...this time I went and tried the Dillinger since it got world's best pizza award. Honestly  I wasn't that impressed with it. The edges seemed a bit burnt  the toppings were a bit thinner than I expected (small thin slice of chicken breast on each slice) and I couldn't find the bacon anywhere or the artichoke hearts...did they run out? Forget? For $35 I expected a lot more but didn't want to knock the review down a star because all other times at a Tony's spot have been 5 star experiences.  The service was excellent  granted I didn't run into the lady that the other guy below had a problem with  but from the host to the waiter everything was smooth. Our server was really helpful in explaining exactly what went into making each item and what his preference was in how to enjoy them...lemon to taste on the Dillinger  parmesan in the soup  etc...  I'll be back as this place is just about as good as their Pizza Rock location...I'll just stick to the regular award winning margarita and New Yorker and pass on the Dillinger.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Good pizza. I would not recommend the caesar salad until they make it a little more tasty (anchovies perhaps?) and use croutons that are not as hard as a piece of wood
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I'm writing this as a Brooklyn boy (Bensonhurst if it matters) who has lived all over and worked in the culinary field for over 35 years: Go to this restaurant. From the meatballs to the bread to the sauce to the pizza  every bite is worth more than you pay and just as good as anything I have ever tasted. The service was also great  not that I honestly paid much attention to anything but my next bite. Go to this restaurant.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Actually went to Palace Station to go to the Oyster Bar  which came highly recommended by my cousin who lives in Vegas.  When we got there however  they told me it was only 21 and over  and I had my two kids.    Without a backup plan  we decided to eat at Little Tony's which was in the same casino.  It was a total gamble without doing any research  not to mention it was relatively empty.  We ended up ordering garlic bread  Caesar salad and a pizza.  The garlic bread was perfect  fresh garlic  a little cheese and parsley.  Perfectly crisp on the outside  and soft and chewy inside -- I could have just eaten that.  Caesar salad is a salad we sort of use to gauge authenticity at Italian restaurants these days.  This salad was perfectly dressed  good amount of anchovy flavor without being fishy.  Fresh slices of Parmesan.  It was better when I added a squirt of lemon  but really a great Caesar.    Pizza had a great thin crust  just a little burnt like we like it.  A little crisp  not soggy.  Great toppings  sauce has hint of sweetness  but good.    Decor wise it was classy  Italian sports bar theme  with some nice  HD TV's showing sports  which we are always a fan of.    This place blew me away to be honest  we got really lucky.  It was a miracle we were even at that casino  and to find such a great Italian spot...wow.  My only regret is I didn't get to try the spaghetti or lasagna  another gauge of a true Italian restaurant  but especially since I hear they make their own pasta.  Anyway...great spot here off the strip.  Even better than Grimaldi's. Highly recommended for good Italian food!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Tried the Eggplant Parm w/ spaghetti & blend of tomato & alfredo sauces. Good-sized portion. Sauce was unremarkable. Eggplant was delicately fried  tasty. Pasta done al dente. Next time I think I'll try a pizza as that is what most reviewers are raving about. Joe's  root beer was a tasty  not too sweet root beer.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,We love this place!  We came for the pizza and were not disappointed in the slightest!  Absolutely love the Cal Italia and no visit to Little Tony's is complete with out their meatball appetizers.  Service was on point and the atmosphere was comfy like a Italian family restaurant from back home in NY.  It's a Pizza Rock fix close to the strip with a home setting.  We'll be back!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My boyfriend and I wandered in to LIttle Tony's- just looking for a place to eat before a movie on a Friday night. We were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is great. We climbed into a big  round  red leather booth and were instantly brought a nice  small portion of soft bread- nothing too overwhelming or too filling. Danielle  our server greeted us. My boyfriend is a vegetarian  and likes to get recommendations from servers. Not only did Danielle lead him to try a new Irish Whiskey  which he loved  she combed the menu with us  explaining things and helping to choose two yummy pizzas! ( we don't even eat pizza!)   I had the bronx  and he had a balsamic reduction fig pizza. Both were very tasty.   This place is romantic enough for a date  and atmospheric and accommodating for a family dinner.   The only thing that could be improved is the complimentary soup-- ours was just broth with 3 fava beans and some stewed tomatoes.  I like the idea of light  but this needed a little something more.  Good food  wonderful atmosphere  and attentive service! See if Danielle is there- she is the best! She will guide you with sincerity  patience and poised attentiveness.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Update to my review.   Still an excellent pizza the service BLOWS NOW!  Twice in a row  and there won't be an opportunity for a third unless it is take out.  It is seat yourself  their isn't enough staff  they are rude and you won't get anything that you ask for unless you get up to go get it. We waited 20 minutes on change after 15 minutes on a box and the check and asking twice. A dinner that should have taken an hour or so took over two and us missing a show we had planned to attend!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Great price awesome food. The pizza is awesome its owned by the same company as ""Pizza Rock"" in downtown which is always packed out because its so awesome. Little Tony's has the same great food and quality and the atmosphere is a little quieter which makes it nice if you're trying to get into a great pizza place on weekend. I recommend it highly. The service is great and the price is fair.   The only reason that I'm not giving it 5 stars is because its located in the Palace Station Casino and the management of that property is unprofessional and the hotel is disgusting. If you're staying at the palace station this place may just make up for the flaws the hotel has... just maybe but those run deep."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I don't know what happened to this place. They changed their menu completely. It now has a very small menu. The pizza doesn't taste the same. Gone is their kids menu  that pasta bake that was so good (can't remember the name)  Gorgonzola fries are also gone. Meatballs ado tasted different as well as their Caesar salad. The staff was friendly but a whole different vibe. Weird. Won't be going back ever!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Pizza was great but the service was AMAZING! Waiter was on his A-game! Constantly refilling drinks  changed the channel because we were talking about the Texas Astros baseball game... He flipped it right to the channel! And our plates were cleaned! I recommend eating pizza here versus getting the typical Pizza Hut  Dominos  etc!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Excellent service  prices  atmosphere. The pizza was delicious  with generous ingredients  and the meat was good quality. The sauce and crust were also excellent.  I will be back!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Here with a Living Social coupon. The restaurant itself is nice  old style Italian. Located next to the food court in the back of a getto casino. The California pizza I order was pretty good. (I'm a pizza aficionado) . 4 stars for the food. 4 stars for the restaurant and the service. 2 stars for the location.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. He made sure to check on us throughout the meal.   The pizzas were pretty tasty  too. Wasn't the best ever  but way better than many places.  Would enjoy going back if we are on the West side  and looking for pizza.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Classic Italian pizza  Cal Italia was unbelievably good along with caprese salad.  Single portions are large enough to share. Yes it will be different than most Italian restaurants you have been to.  Excellent quality food.  Great to have this wonderful restaurant at Palace Station
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My first time eating here so I ordered a few things. The meatballs are about a 5-6 on a scale of 1-10. No taste at all. Pizza is about a 7.  Spaghetti and meatballs is about a 5. Prices are pretty cheap but I now know why. Everything is bland...reminds me of prison food. I'll never be back. Refusing to pay for the spegetti and meatballs.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I used to think this was a very good place to go. Now I know  I can not live without this amazing perfect dining experience. 150% outstanding every second  every single time. WOW
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Cal Italia pizza was unique (in a good way) as it successfully incorporated fig jam  Asiago and prosciutto into a nice pie.  Food served hot as it left the pizza oven.  Super inexpensive.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,This place was a wonderful find!  From the food to the service  we had an all around great experience.  The pizza is delicious and the bologna was AMAZING.  Special thanks to Michael R.  our server!  Would definitely come back for seconds.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I came here the other night with my boyfriend and we were both extremely pleased!  We had the tartufo pizza  spicy calamari  ceasar salad  and for dessert we had the mud pie.  We started with the ceasar salad  which has yummy homemade croutons and the spicy calamari  which has a nice kick to it but not too much.  I am in love with truffle and it tasted so delicious along with the cheese  mushrooms  and prosciutto!  For dessert we had the mud pie and it was soo good!  Perfect for sharing.  We debated between the mud pie and the other desserts but we will just have to try the other desserts next time.    Marcus was our server and he was great!  He was attentive and friendly.  He brought refills right when we needed them and checked in with us after our food was delivered.  We will definitely be back!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,If you're looking for authentic Italian food and great scotch drinks.  This is definitely the place to be! The meatballs  sausage  and prosciutto are amazing. The caste iron pizza is a must try! You won't be disappointed. The flavors in every dish compliment each other for a  comfort food feeling. The pictures and lighting make Tony's feel like you're at home around the family table talking to family and close friends.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"This spot wasn't even on my radar til it was featured on Groupon! My guy goes to Palace Station for the sports book  but I rarely venture in myself. This spot was a lot better than expected and is a big upgrade from the previous forgettable restaurant!  MEATBALL APP: Get it  they're just as good as sibling Pizza Rock's version. 3/$5 is enough to share  they're huge and swimming in a great sauce. Save it for dipping your pizza crusts. HOT HOUSE MADE CALABRESE SAUSAGE: I almost didn't get this after reading the menu description that said it was sauteed in local honey  but I'm glad my guy suggested it. Spicy sausage meets sweet sauce  surprisingly balanced with good but not overwhelming heat. CAPRESE HOUSE SPECIAL SALAD: The small is still big enough to share  but I found this salad overdressed and underwhelming. The mozz was good  but there were barely any peppers or olives. All of the produce was super fresh though. THE STATION PIZZA: Classic meat-heavy pizza with pepperoni  salami  linguica  bacon  bell pepper  olives  tomatoes  and two types of onions. Overflowing with toppings  you can share a 9"" small and still be satisfied. My guy and I both agreed we'd get this again. CAL ITALIA: One of their featured award-winning pies  with four cheeses  sweet fig preserves  prosciutto  and balsamic drizzle. I've had similar pies and enjoyed them  but the balsamic almost overwhelmed this version. Still good  but not great. SAUTEED SPINACH: Where can you find shareable sides for only $3 these days?! This order was a huge heap of spinach  lightly seasoned and an awesome addition to our otherwise heavy dishes.  CARAMEL BREAD PUDDING: I'm not much of a bread pudding fan  but it was my guy's choice and it was actually pretty good. Served in a cute skillet  caramel flavors are only hints rather than a punch in the mouth  good for sharing.  Service was attentive and friendly throughout  wish I'd caught the guy's name because I'd request him again. Seat yourself  snag a cushy booth if you can. Note that they have lunch specials and HH specials to take advantage of  as well as the occasional deal up on Groupon."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"The pizza's were delicious and the service was good. Two big downers: our waiter failed to tell us about the early bird specials which I happened to discover on the drinks menu  and which saved us $2 on each of our 9"" Pizza.  Also the noise level was incredibly high. It was impossible to carry on a conversation with other members of our party without shouting. Loud music overhead and brick walls makes for lousy horrible acoustics."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Awesome food   you must   must   must go here. Totally worth the drive to the ""questionable"" area of Las Vegas at Sahara and  the 15. We had the Cal Italian pizza  the New Yorker  meatballs and split a Ceasars salad  yummmo!!! Our server   Mark  was great and gave us great recommendations. Used a Groupon   we will definitely be back  don't you miss it."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Me and my daughter  just had a amazing late dinner at Little Tonys  . The food is wonderful and the staff is even Better !! The manager  Amber took great care of us and was very helpful and are waiter  Michael  was nice and full of good info  on the food   I ask lots of questions  when I go some place and he had the answers . I'll   be back again and again and will be letting all my friends  and family  know that when in Las Vegas  it is a must  for a good  meal   as well as a good time 5+********  !!!!! (Ty Amber*  Mike* and George *!!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,First  a little background. We eat out every single night  bar none  and know almost every restaurant in Las Vegas. And  we are Chairman players at Station Casinos  and eat in their restaurants very frequently.  We tried LT shortly after they opened. The food was good (not great)  and despite the fact that there were only 3 occupied tables  no manager ever visited our table. There were several issues with the kitchen  but it was new and we let it go.  Tonight  we tried LT again. Nothing has changed. There continue to be issues with the kitchen  among other things. After water glasses sitting empty  and after being told that water was coming  we eventually had to go up to the bar and ask for water ourselves. How embarrassing.  We ordered a large Caprese salad  which was quite good (it better be good for that price). We also ordered a white pizza  which was OK. And  we ordered a Chicken Parm dinner  which was NOT OK at all. It doesn't even come with pasta! So that was an extra $3 for pasta. We asked for half marinara/half Alfredo sauce  and that was an extra charge  too.   When our salad came out  we asked for some time to eat it before the pizza and parm came out. We were told they would take 15-20 minutes (perfect!). But the chicken came out alone  without the pasta  without the pizza  in less than 5 minutes. We asked if they could keep it warm until we finished the salad  but in literally 2 minutes  it was back  this time being delivered by a clueless manager named Sabrina. We tried to tell her that it was just sent back to be kept warm  but she was so confused and defensive  and frankly  totally uncaring. So it went it back again  only to come back a couple of minutes later  this time with the pasta underneath the chicken. And there was no Alfredo sauce to be found until 5 minutes later  when it came out separately in a small bowl.  We were told that pasta would be served in a square dish  but it came out underneath the chicken. And this cost extra.  Our server  Marcus  had an excellent personality and must have been frustrated by the lack of support from the manager  as well as the numerous deficiencies from the kitchen. How could this manager not back him up? Who wouldn't be frustrated by this absolute failure of management? Poor guy.  I tried to talk to Sabrina  but she could not have possibly cared less what I had to say. I tried to explain myself  to let her know that we were very engaged in the local restaurant scene  but she was having none of it  just defending herself by stating how long she was in the restaurant business. Instead of welcoming my feedback  she was so annoyed that I dared even to talk to her.  After knowing all the issues that occurred  she never came back to our table. Not once. She never apologized. She never offered us even a cup of coffee. Nothing. She walked past us several times with her nose in the air (both literally and figuratively).  And  we never saw her approach even a single table to check on anyone in the dining room. Maybe she just couldn't handle the truth.  After we finished eating  we sat for a while  and Sabrina had lots of opportunities to come back  to check on us  to make things right. She did none of it. She knowingly and intentionally let us leave unhappy.  Frankly  she is an embarrassment to Tony's good name  and a total misfit for this restaurant. Tony did not get where he is today by allowing such unprofessional managers to represent him. I hope he gets wise and cuts her before this new restaurant  with so much potential  crashes and burns.  We will try it again  maybe for the third time  or maybe for the last time. And we will be absolutely certain to report back here what we experience.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,I'm starting to loose faith with some of the postings on yelp. I see high ratings for this place but that was not my experience. I had a Caesars salad that was flavorless and tasted like is was pre made and taken out of the refrigerator . Once served there was no offering of fresh ground pepper. My main course was the chicken parm. The chicken was tender but there was very little cheese or sauce on it. For the price they charge it should come with a side of pasta  but it doesn't. I was with one other person who had pizza  the problem was his food was served 15 minutes before mine and I just sat waiting and waiting. My last comment is on how many times do you need to be asked how the food is. I was interrupted 4 times by 4 different people  I think this job should be left to the server and once is enough.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Love this place! Been here 3 times now. It's not what you would expect to find in a place like Palace Station. The menu is similar to Pizza Rock but has more of a wider selection. Everything we have ever ordered is great - and the decor is fun and funky also!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Since this is owned by the same people who own Pizza Rock I had to try this place out.  It's kind of odd that it's located inside Palace Station since it's not a trendy casino and which is why it took me a couple months to actually check this place out.  This restaurant is very similar to Pizza Rock and has many of the same menu items.  I had the sangria which was just meh. I wouldn't recommend it. Very sweet. I thought it would be served in a wine class but it was served in a glass you'd serve soda. I would have a beer next time instead.   I tried the meatballs and they were the same ones that you can find at Pizza Rock. They are amazing and so tender and the sauce is tasty. I would recommend trying these if you had not.   We then tried the picante pizza. Very spicy as you would think but tasty. I enjoyed it. If you enjoy food on the hot side this pizza is for you.   We then had to save room for dessert because they had a bread pudding that could not be found on the Pizza Rock menu. This was a perfect size and was great for splitting.   Overall very good but similar to Pizza Rock.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,The service was outstanding  our waiter Marcuswas very kind. We only had one problem  one person in my party ordered the chicken fingers and it was undercooked  but replaced it and took it off the bill. I recommend this restaurant  the food was delicious  but is not what we expected. We really expected pizza rock because it is the same owners but a totally different food venue . If you're looking for a classic Neapolitan pizza this is not the place because they don't have the correct  oven to cook them. The manager came out and explain to us the difference between this place and pizza rock and the difference of the ovens. The meatballs were on point and the pizzas were just okay. But the service was incredible and the people are very friendly . If you're really into pizzas like I am  I highly suggest you check out pizza rock before coming here. I would def  come back if they started making real Neapolitan pizza here  but they don't. If you just want a good pizza this is definitely a place to go    but I'm just being honest that it's not the real deal. Outstanding service and very awesome people work here. I like they have kids meals too! I'm gonna try it again sometime .
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Me and my boyfriend love this Italian Restaurant. We find it one of the best Italian restaurants in Las Vegas. Even though half of their menu is pizza and there are about 10 or less other entrees  I love their Chicken Parmesan  it's the best I've ever had. Needless to say  their mozzarella sticks are probably the best I've ever had  as well. Way better pricing than some places on the strip  and the quality is amazing.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"Pretty good spot with great service.  We had the Don Giovanni pizza (white pie with mozzarella  prosciutto  arugula  parmigiano  peppadew peppers  and goat cheese) and the Brooklyn calzone (mozzarella  spinach  ricotta  and garlic).     The pizza and the calzone were good and well made  but nothing to get ""foodie"" excited about. The cheese was pretty good quality  but if the ingredients were higher quality  I probably would have given them 4 stars.    Prices are reasonable and they have a great drink and food happy hour 3-6pm  and then 9-close  7 days a week.    Our waitress was very friendly and polite.   This spot is under 3 miles from the strip  so well worth a quick Uber trip."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Was staying at the Palace Station and came into Little Tony's with friends. We had a blast as our waitress/server was very friendly. We had the Meatball Appetizer and Cal Italia Pizza. The meatballs were really good  just wish it came with bread. The Cal Italia was pretty good as well.  We came back Sunday to watch football and had the Old Chicago and The New Yorker. Now these are the ones that made me give the 5 stars. I hope this restaurant picks up in popularity since it is hidden away at the Palace Station.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"The Skinny update: skip the Dillinger - the ""world's best pizza"" is pretty terrible; hit the spaghetti & meatballs special  sausage and peppers or the sauteed spinach instead (3.5)  service is pretty good at this pizza joint (4)value: with some hits and misses on the menu this place rates a 3.5 with bump up to 4.  Okay   right off the bat   there are some great things about Little Tony's but some changes have happened since  my last review.   The complimentary soup is now gone which isn't a huge loss in my eyes as it wasn't that great to begin with.   The spaghetti and meatballs special for 2 on Sundays is still really a great value and absolutely delicious for $26.99. The generous helpings of garlic bread (half a loaf)    Caesar salad (large portion  also really good with their house dressing) that come with it are also excellent Italian American classics (see previous review for more details).   So we came in with a $50 Groupon we got. We finally deviated from our spaghetti special leanings to try the Dillinger. At $35  it is the most expensive pizza on the menu... But was it worth it? Magic eightball reads absolutely not.   Sporting a kind of deeper crust with a coating of cheese  the Dillinger crust was too doughy and thick in texture for my taste. It's not a really good representation of deep dish pizza at all (hardly a Gino's or a Lou Malnati's). The sauce was very bland for a ""smoky vodka sauce""  and the vegetables were not completely cooked on top of the pizza. As a matter of fact  the broccoli was on the verge of rawness which was off putting. The small slice of dry chicken on top really didn't do it for me in terms of protein/vegetable ratio. Overall  the flavors and textures didn't work well together at all and I would hate for others to think that this dish is representative of what this restaurant has to offer.  We also got the fennel sausage with peppers and sauteed spinach. I loved the tangy  rich tomato vodka sauce that smothered the fennel sausage. It was so good and such a guilty pleasure. I would not hesitate to order it again and the serving size is quite generous (it sports at least 3 large sausages in the dish). The only thing that would have made it better would be some bread to mop up some of the delicious sauce. The sauteed spinach was also a solid dish but didn't have the wow factor of the fennel sausage.  Despite the disappointment with the Dillinger  we still really love this place and are interested in exploring their menu. Service is still good and prompt with refills. The spaghetti Sunday special is the best value here and we'll definitely hit this place up again for that alone (3.5 starred review with a bump up to 4 stars)."
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,"This place is  delicious   we ordered the ""New Yorker""  pizza... And it's quite amazing!!  The staff is really great too"
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Love this place. Good atmosphere inside the restaurant despite the not so great atmosphere in the casino. I ordered a pizza with like 5 cheeses and prosciutto and a balsamic drizzle on it because it said it was the food network winner. It was delicious....but when I went to receive a comp the lady was telling me how great the New Yorker pizza was. I went back and asked the gentleman running the place about it and he said people go crazy over the New Yorker so that is definitely what needs to be tried next time. Also had the honey whisky wings that had a lot of sauce and flavor and the perfect amount of spice. Great service as well. Great bar great beer.
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,Everything was great here food was awesome service was fast and friendly we will definitely  be coming back !!!
Pizza;Restaurants;Italian,My second visit here and it definitely improved since my last time. Entire staff was attentive  helpful and very friendly.   I decided to skip the spaghetti and meatballs this time and get a pizza. The pizza and meatballs were delish and were included on the happy hour menu.
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Professional Services,"You will see many reviews of Peak on the web and I tend to agree with the vast majority of them.  You will find the office & sales staff great (5 stars).  The quote that I received from Peak was also the most reasonable which is why I selected them as our contractor.   We chose a light blue pebble plaster.  The out come in my estimation was horrible  the color is streaked and blotchy and varies from completely white to dark blue (I have posted pictures on Google review)  When I questioned them Tony  the construction foreman  told me that ""this is a perfectly normal out  come"" and ""to be expect in any color plaster"".  When I pushed back on this response John (the owner)  changed the story and said it was my fault and  ""the chemistry is causing some discoloration""  So if everything goes OK Peak gets 5 stars...  if anything goes wrong ""your on your own""..... Zero Stars"
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Professional Services,I had new plaster put in (Quartz)  new tile all around  and 2 lights (pool and spa). I received a quote  was happy with it and put down the 20% deposit. I was given a work schedule  which was adhered to throughout the whole process (weather was a factor  but did not interrupt the project). The work that was done was excellent and I'm very happy on how it turned out. I would have given 5 stars if the office coordinator did not fat finger a missing $775 on my invoice. The day before plastering I received a call from them saying I needed to pay an additional $775 because the (signed) contract was wrong. That shouldn't have been my fault  especially since I had a signed contract initialed by the owner or a supervisor just under the prices. I see what happened based on the initial numbers during the quote process but I shouldn't have been put in that last minute situation - their employee should have been held accountable  and I shouldn't have been the one to correct it. In the end  it wouldn't be worth my time to fight it  I just wanted everything done (2 week project). I have a really nice pool now  so I'm happy about it. It was in really bad shape  but it's beautiful now. That's all I wanted  so thanks for that Peak.
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Professional Services,We had three estimates for having our pool / spa replastered and decided to use peak as they had a November white quarts for same price as regular white plaster 'special'  We have large dogs and needed a hard schedule  this would be our only complaint  don't take it as a total negative though they communicated with us daily  emails  phone calls  stopped by in person on some days where we had weather delays  but they would not commit to a schedule and we had a few frustrating delays getting started Once they started they chipped the old plaster down first day  cleaned and fixed grout on tile second day  final cleaned third day and replastered fourth day  not consecutive days  we had rain and strong winds a few days in the middle obviously not Peaks fault We used our spa tonight for first time since having the work done and it is so smooth it's wonderful and the white quarts plaster is very elegant (it was grey and we almost went back to grey) and really put the new look back into our yard and pool / spa If we stay in our house (we are thinking of moving after 22 years) I will update this as the plaster ages since that really seems to be where companies show the biggest flaw.. Warranty
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Professional Services,These guys are completely unprofessional. They did the plaster for my pool and it was probably the worst experience ever. They did not properly cover areas of the pool that did not require plaster. We had real boulders on the edges and they were covered in plaster. They also did not cover or protect near our house and our house got plaster all over it. Called them back to repair 2 times and they argued every single time. So it's never their fault. Please do your research and do not use this company. You will be happier in the long run and will probably receive better work from another company.
Home Services;Pool Cleaners;Professional Services,We had a couple of quotes and went with Peak due to their deal on quartz. Peak were professional and very polite to deal with. The pool was completed one day ahead of schedule  and we are very pleased with the results. The company left the property as clean as it was found  and the supervisor regularly came to the property to check on progress. I would use this company again!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,"Monday 4/13/15  4:08pm  I love the way this place is closed off from the bar area.  I don't suggestion bringing a baby or toddler in here because it's STILL smokey.     Monday is Pot roast day (our favorite)! We sit at our favorite table and order our drinks and food.  It came out hot  well seasoned  & very little fat. The veggies took on much of the flavor  yuummm! Coffee as always light mild roasted Folgers. 1 Irish creamer  1 creamer and two sugars for me.    They have specials & coupons on their ""T-birdlounge"" app.  They have their own rewards for $10 off SIXTH purchase of $20  buy 10 Strombolis get ONE free  buy 10 burgers get ONE free  or Senior's deal $5 off a $10 visit.  Also I see they are partners with Shell Fuel Rewards Network  dine in points too.   You save a bit if you frequent regular here  you link your payment method to shell FRN account. Each time you use that payment method here you're building towards earning 10 even 25 cent off a gallon of gas."
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,It's you friendly neighborhood good grub and cheap drinks bar. 5 star service. Always great drink specials available.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Once a week eating at this place is totally worth it. Staff is very courteous and responsive. Debbie and Erika are the best! Plus the food is always great.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Stromboli...salami  ham  pepperoni and sausage! It's sooooo gooood and it is HUGE.!!!! This bar is in the middle of nowhere but it has a comfortable atmosphere. The menu looks good. Gaming machines are so so. The main reason I go here is for the stromboli. I'm sure you will like it.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,It is what it is - a typical bar with typical bar food.  I've never had a bad meal here and the prices are average for this type of food.  They have a regular waitress who's been there since I've been working in the area (2 yrs) so its nice to see the same face every time I go.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Love this place! My family and I used to live really close and now that we don't we still visit often. Food is good  and the servers are so friendly and make us feel so welcome. Erica is amazing! She makes us and everyone feel so welcome and we make sure she is there before we come in. She talks to everyone and has the best customer service!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,We just randomly stopped for breakfast here.  It was really delicious! Julie was our server and she was really perfect.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Solid fun place looks good on outside and inn I just recently relocated to this side of town and was not sure about this place but after always driving by decided to make a stop and it was well worth it the staff was very friendly and service was excellent cold mugs of beer and the chicken fried steak I recommend trying. I will be there again soon
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,A great local bar location with cheap food and nice servers. We arrived around 10 and they were empty in the dining area. The server was so friendly and greeted each patron like she new them  most of the rig upsets she most likely did.   My mom and I ordered some breakfast and prices were beyond reasonable. My omelet was made to order and was good.   Service with a smile and great prices while watching the games  we'll likely be back soon to partake in more of the bar area as well.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,5 stars for a locals bar?   I only reviewing the hot wings.  Honestly the best in Vegas.  I've had wings a lot of bars  restaurants  and wings places and so far the best.  I think their sauce is scratch made because little flakes of pepper and seeds.  It's got the right tang and heat and always cooked to perfection.  Nothing worse than soggy skin and the wings are big and meaty  unlike some shitty chain  that will remain nameless(who I think has the worst wings).  Beer prices are good and it's nice quiet place to unwind and have a drink. Never crowded.  This is definitely my spot for wings  and it's open 24 hours.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,The chicken wings here are the best. I go there atleast once a week. The wait staff there are very friendly too.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Just had midnight breakfast steak and eggs with my sister and mom who had fish and chips. Our first time here. Bartender Charles had great customer service he was funny and very welcoming! Food was great we will be back!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,This bar had a separate bar and restaurant.  The food was awesome with fresh ingredients.  Our server she was so nice and on point... I will be back again!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,First a couple of qualifying statements. I've been to too many wing spots to count. If you look thru the history  it's a fair selection across the USA.  This was my second attempt at finding a wing spot in sin city. I did NOT have high hopes based on my Yelp selections. This place is a smokin hot treasure. I was treated to a wing foursome thanks to Erica. I had traditional hot buffalo  grilled BBQ & teriyaki And the amazing sweet Thai finished in the pizza oven. All are deep fried but finished in separate fashion. They are allowed to caramelize & are so crispy & delicious   I may actually start eating again  while typing this review.   Another great (and quite shameful) fact. I only finished 15 wings. Based on my 'normal' consumption (for testing purposes only) is around 20. These babies are HUGE.  Everyone who came in she knew by name & even remembered previous orders.  Erica & T-Bird Lounge make it to the Hall of Fame. GO THERE NOW FOR WINGS.  Beer selection solid with cold glasses. Epic!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,After swimming all day we stopped here to eat as we were really hungry. Worst idea yet. $11 chicken fingers looked like a school lunch and my wife steak sandwich was the worst ever. The bartender never even acknowledged us ? Well just a warning for the next couple who walks in.... Turn around and go .....
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Tbird LOVES their locals  what more can I say? They have amazing food specials  a comfortable atmosphere  a come as you are mentality  and they just want to see you have a fun time playing their loose slots or enjoying a fabulous beverage served by Lisa  the best bartender west of the Mississippi. Funny  beautiful  smart  and hard working. A truly amazing woman.  Hungry? Ask for Erica  the sweetest waitress who always smiles and can chat with you like you've been old friends for years.  This place has it all  but wait...there's Lottabucks! Simply sign up for a players card  gamble  pick five numbers  and every hour you're spinning down the race track at your chance at $100 000! You never win it  but sometimes you can grab 15 bucks in free slot play.  The best part? Cleopatra Keno and double up poker machines. Put this all together and you have the quintessential amalgamation of a true locals hotspot. Keep on keepin on Tbird!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,There are times the day is just so busy you don't want to cook dinner.  Great alternative...this place was fantastic!  Delicious food  great staff. Just moved to the neighborhood and will most certainly visit again.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,TACO BASKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  $5  I think I have eaten about 50 of these baskets..... 3 hard tacos  fresh fried shells  ground beef  lett  toms  cheese add salsa.  Really basic but somehow tastes Awesome!  Even better when dranking.... maybe they add MSG?  staff is always good n friendly  chicken fried steak is good too... machines do pay out  sometimes....  C
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I ordered the wings and Stromboli  can't go wrong with the wings. Stromboli is way too big! A small is enough for 2 people.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Whenever I'm in the mood for chicken wings I always come here. They have a bucket of wings for $22 and it's more then enough for me and my man to share. The wings are BIG  they dont give you the little ones that barely have any meat. These are chicken wings on steriods lol. I always get the wings plain  extra crispy  with sauce on the side. I like their teriyaki and hot sauce. The hot sauce is very hot though  it has peppers in it. If you dont like hot I would suggest getting mild.   On my last visit I wanted breakfast  so I ordered the chicken fried steak and eggs. It was filling  but it was definitely not the best CFS I have had. The gravy was not homemade and you could tell it was from a powder. Not good. I was busy chatting with my boyfriend and our server  Chris  who was very attentive  and by the time I went to eat some of the CFS  the gravy was gummy and sticky. It was not appetizing at all. I decided to scrape most of the gravy off and just use hot sauce  but it was quite disappointing. My meal came with cottage fries  which is like fried potatoes that are crusty and delicious  and toast. I would advise against ordering the CFS  but the wings are for sure a winner!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,This review is for the BAR section only.  I live literally about 3 minutes away driving from T Bird and needless to say have passed by many times over the past couple of years. I was looking forward to checking this place out based on the reviews and location. Unfortunately  I was extremely let down. Upon walking in I had a bad vibe. The whole place smelled of cigarettes and the place looked run down.  The bartender (I didn't catch his name) gave off a horrible first impression. No greeting or smile and the bar was empty except for one other person (it was around midnight). This should've been my sign to run but I decided to stick it out and give them a chance. He took our drink orders and handed us a menu. There's no HH here  which is fine with me. I don't mind paying full price. We ended up ordering wings  which were actually really good but I think my overall experience just made me want to leave. All in all  we spent about 30 minutes here and couldn't wait to go. We hardly saw the bartender because he was too busy chit chatting with someone on the opposite side of the bar and took forever getting our check (or what felt like forever). I will never return here ever again. 2 stars for wings; 0 stars for the service.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,"The food here does not exactly stand out to me as ""delicious and unforgettable"" however  the restaurant is pretty much across the street from where I live. The breakfast is very typical of what you could make at home. The restaurant is dimly lit so it great for hangover mornings. The service is usually pretty outstanding. The staff is very attentive and quick to bring you anything you want. They've even got jokes."
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,This place is so great. Always very chill and relaxing to come to with the nicest bartenders  especially Lisa! I don't even have to worry about creepers creeping either ;)  They have a 24 hour menu so you can get your fat on anytime of the day. Plus a dining room area so Hunnie Bunnie can come and chill too :) Super convenient that it's right across the street from the crib too so it's a short walk away!  And TV's to catch your favorite sports.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,The food here has been ok to good.  I've gotten cheeseburgers  chicken fingers and fries and none of it was bad.  The bartender  Charles  is super nice and funny.  It's a good little spot to go to because it's close to my friend's house  but it's very much a typical Vegas bar.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,We found a new chill spot for our late night friend meet-ups! The kitchen takes great care in the food they make  more than I would expect for the low prices. The service is bomb  too! Andrew made sure we were satisfied and taken care of. We'll be back for sure.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Good neighborhood staple.  Lots of variation on the menu will make anybody happy at this restaurant. I've been to several of their locations  this one has the typical prompt service and decent food.  The BLT salad was really good  with the option to add chicken or steak for no extra charge.  The taco salad is really good too  and the french dip is not bad.  I know several people who love their wings  I personally don't like to eat meat with bones in it so I haven't tried them.  Will definitely be back for a quick and easy meal.  Good with large parties as well.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I didn't really like the restaurant at all. You walk in and it smells like cigarettes and you have just go wherever and I don't like that there should be someone taking you to a table and it took the waiter about 5ish minutes to get us menus and then once we wanted to order the lady was at the bar and she was acting like she had a million customers when it was my table and maybe 3 people at the bar.... the food wasn't great . So I pretty much paid them 60 bucks to make us sick! I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I love this place ! The food is good and it's right by my house ! The grave bartender name Charles is awesome too !
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I ordered the fish and chips and I must say it was sub par.  I'm all about trying new things  but this particular item was not worth it.  Never coming back.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Nice neighborhood gaming bar. Even though the outside looks a bit retro the inside is modern and clean.  Not sure if they always have this special but PBR on draft for $1! Our bartender on this Friday night was very friendly and attentive. We didn't get any food but our friend raved about their pizza.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,2014 Update:  They have changed their Players Club...it's not so generous anymore. :(  So now their review loses a star.  I still continue to come here  just not as often as I used to.  I am not as happy with their new system  I miss the old one and the wheel spin.  Still good food and great staff.   Original Post:  In a town with many local bar choices  this is one of my favorite local hangouts.  Even though I I am typically there during the graveyard shift.  I think that have one of the best chicken fried steak and eggs in town.  Their pizza is also very thick  generously proportioned  and delicious.    Friendly graveyard bartenders (Jason and Charles) and their large menu is available 24/7.  I have been regularly going there for a few years now and have been known to put a few bucks in the machines  so I can also attest that they are very generous with their players club for regular players  just this month I received $400 in vouchers!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,The other T-Birds are great  but the staff at this one makes it not so much fun. For me this isn't good as they are right across the street from my house. It seems that if you aren't a cop in here to get free food or old and crusty you are second class. The food also isn't nearly as good as the other locations  I think that this one is resting a lot on its other locations for good reviews etc.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Pretty good food for a gaming bar.  Beer selection could be better  but it's a nice place to stop in for a quick bite
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I go here mostly to watch the away Rebel's games. They usually already have the game playing  and even if they don't  they are more than happy to change the channel for you. They have game day specials if you wear Rebel red  and also NFL specials.   Service has always been great. Friendly faces. Fast service. Good small talk.  As far as the food goes  it's pretty typical of what you would get at any other bar. They do offer a few late night specials  such as my personal favorite  steak and eggs for 6.99. When I'm too lazy to drive all the way to Southpoint  TBirds is my main place to go for some cheap steak and eggs.   Overall  a good bar. It's never really too crowded  at least when I go. I think I've started going enough recently that they're finally starting to recognize me  which is always a good thing.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Food was great ...service fun....clean....cheap unbelievably cheap....i will come back everytime i come to vegas!!!!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,So we tried the wings for the first time here and I have to say  they were pretty good. We had ordered them for pick up and they were quite quick and the waitress was very nice as well. I would definitely come again.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,My husband and I will occasionally come here for breakfast. The food and service has been great every time. One of these days we will need to come here for dinner and try their pizza.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,"Consistent $6 breakfast.  2 eggs  breakfast meat  country fries  and toast.  These were served quickly and effeciently by an older waitress ""Mary"".  Dining room was clean.  The beverage girl kept my drink full.  Did not like the consistency of the ham.  I will be back."
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,The best thing about this T-Birds is it's so close to my house. I often find myself here when we don't want to make decisions about dinner.   They have a separate restaurant and bar area there for those that don't appreciate inhaling cigarette smoke during their meal.   My go-to items: Chicken fried steak  taco basket and the grilled chicken caesar salad. The menu is a mile long so there is plenty of bar food to choose from. They have great breakfast items and killer Bloody Marias. Plenty of beer on tap and the service is always pretty good.   It's a solid bar with solid food.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,I go to the location in Henderson on Eastern near the 215  but I hear this location is also good. I love this place because it's the closest thing to having a 24 hour diner in the Las Vegas Metro area. The food is great and so is the service. Wether you're going for breakfast  lunch  or dinner. It's all good and there are even special things you can order off the menu  like fried ice cream! Enjoy!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Great service  great food! Breakfast is awesome  highly recommend the cottage fries (only served until noon). If you are looking for a good burger come here.
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Came in with 15 people. I had the Reuben sandwich. Monster amounts of fresh  thinly sliced corned beef. The bread was fresh and great! Had to be one of the best Reuben sandwiches I've ever had. Every one else seemed to enjoy their food as well......... my friends hamburger looked REALLY good. I will be back again!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,Went here for the first time last week and had a blast! We didn't try the food (besides the veggie platter which was nice and fresh) but the drinks were cold and environment was warm. Everyone that was employed there was unbelievably nice from the swing bartender and server to the graveyard bartender that came on. Everyone took great care of us and was so friendly! I will certainly be back to visit these folks!
Nightlife;Bars;Diners;Restaurants;American (Traditional);Sports Bars,When I work till 5am  I drop by for an IPA and the steak & eggs special.  $14 with tax and tip  and I'm usually the only one there.
Restaurants;Pizza,Pizza by the slice open until 3:00 a.m. is the lure of Sirrico's Pizza in New York New York Hotel & Casino. Is the pizza good? Nope. Is it worth $5? Maybe. Will you be full? Probably.  The line at 12:30 a.m. was about 15 minutes long. Basically  you pick  a slice or two from the pre-made pizzas and then it is reheated as you head to the register. The happiest customers seemed to be those getting whole pies to go.  The pizza line also was the scene of one of the saddest things I saw in Vegas. A possibly homeless person right in front of me got a slice of pizza  discreetly folded it  stuffed it in his pocket  and headed for the door. It broke my heart and made me want to give him my slice  too.  I got a slice of Jalapeno and Pepperoni. It put some quick carbs in my belly and let me get back out on the casino floor. Let Sirrico's Pizza do the same for you if you are just hungry.
Restaurants;Pizza,My brother and I were trying to get to In-N-Out from the strip on foot  and failed  so we found ourselves in NYNY.  This seemed like the quickest cheap meal so we tried it. There was no line  and the pizzas sitting out were fresh. I got two slices  a pep and pep & black olive. My bro got a pep and breadsticks.  The pizza was okay  but proper NY it was not. The entire crust was a bit chewy and did not have the blackened crispy cracker quality of an authentic NY style pie. The bottom was golden brown at best  and while not bad at almost $6 a damn slice this was an affront to NY pizza.  Decent grease level to tame a late night buzz  but not a good example of NY pizza.
Restaurants;Pizza,Ugh!! I'm surprised this place got this many good reviews. I'm sorry but I'm hesitant about giving it 3 stars but I felt it was just ok  maybe even subpar.  For the price  ranging $4.95 for cheese to $5.50 with toppings  the price is competitive to the others in Vegas.  The pizzas may LOOK like NYC but that's about it. The only taste my slice had going was the sauce. The dough had no taste  and was chewy like cardboard. My drooling taste buds was really hoping the experience would take me back to my visit to NYC but it failed. Even the cheese was blah! I couldn't even finish the slice and tossed it away.  What we SHOULD have done was gone with our first choice... Secret Pizza at Cosmopolitan. Well  I was still hungry I made Stephen walk to Cosmo with me and got the White pizza at Secret Pizza. Best decision of the night.  Sorry folks but there's better pizza. Don't let the aroma fool you. The service is rude  and not in the NYC way  and the food is a step above cafeteria. It's just OK.
Restaurants;Pizza,We were in New York New York gambling on our last day in Vegas and decided we wanted something to eat. We found this place and thought Pizza sounded good. It wasn't busy when we were there; we walked in  and were promptly served in this cafeteria style pizza place. Decent sized slices of New York style pizza  the price isn't bad for Vegas.   The problem is the taste. It was bland. I had the pepperoni and sausage slice and there was almost nothing to it. Even after going back and putting crushed pepper  seasoned salt and parmesan cheese on it  there was still barely any flavor. The sauce was bland  the meat was bland  everything was bland. My wife had the same issue with her piece of pizza. There was almost no flavor to it.   It wasn't bad pizza  I just expected to taste.... Something.   But I guess if I wanted something good  I should have gone to a real restaurant.
Restaurants;Pizza,Love this pizza!  20 bucks fed two of us a slice of pizza and a soda each.  So tasty  we ate there for lunch AND dinner in one day! I highly recommend.
Restaurants;Pizza,BEST pizza place on the strip... ANYTIME of the day!  My honee and I were walking the strip... looking for a low key bar to eat and watch the UK/US World Cup game... and couldn't really find anywhere open so we decided to take a stroll into New York New York and saw a beacon of light shining from Sirrico's calling my name.  As always the service was quick and they had the best bargain... a slice of pizza & draft COORS for $5.95. Where are you going to get that kind of bargain on the strip? I got traditional Veggie and I loved the thin sliced crust. The cold beer was a perfect pair as always. Also... with all the sports bars around the pizza joint  we were able to find a seat and enjoy the game... Perfect!
Restaurants;Pizza,I can not believe the reviews I am reading. My husband and I went there twice during our Vegas stay 10/28/09-11/03/09  and would love to have a pie now. The service was excellent  and the pizza was wonderful. We ordered a traditional and it was so yummy! I am not sure why anyone would not love their pizza. I wish they had one in Houston!!
Restaurants;Pizza,Meh.   Not bad  not great. It's pizza. Eat it.   Beer makes it better.
Restaurants;Pizza,Great slice of classic Italian pie! Exactly what I was looking for. The traditional is thin and bends over  but they have square thick Sicilian as well. Traditional is the kind you have to fold a little for rigidity. Loved the pepperoni and sliced sausage.
Restaurants;Pizza,Pretty decent pizza for a quick meal. It's way better than the pizza place upstairs! Oh  they have a beer and a slice of pizza combo for like $ 7! (3/6/12)
Restaurants;Pizza,This to me was great pizza! I enjoyed it because the slices were huge and the prices were good. Its also open late. This will definitely be the pizza place for me to go to in Vegas!!!
Restaurants;Pizza,Great place for a cheap  quick bite to eat. I was drunk every time I've had this  but it was always amazing  like most food is after drinking. Great place to get a little something in your tummy before a night of drinking!
Restaurants;Pizza,We went to Newyork newyork hotel just to eat pizza here cause one of our friends recommended this place for VEGETARIAN pizza. There was no line ( we went around 10pm) and we got a couple slices of Newyork style vegetarian pizza  it looked quite tempting ( we were very hungry) but they did not reheat the pizza (I like my pizza hot). One Slice was quite filling for me; it had good amount of cheese ( which I do not like as much) and veggies but it tasted okay! Nothing too different. They had good meat pizza options and pasta  salads  etc.
Restaurants;Pizza,"Sirrico's is exactly what it is  and exactly not what it isn't.  I might have confused myself with that comment but let me elaborate... It was born in the New York  New York Casino ""streets"" area as a New York City style pizza place.  It is a solid New York City style pizza place in the middle of a casino in the middle of the desert.  It isn't perfect NYC pizza.  It is probably a bit more Sbarro's than it is strait from Italy  however  don't hate on the place because it isn't shipped in from Italy.   The prices are reasonable  not great by any means  but not heavily expensive.  Generally you can get a piece of pie and a beer for $5.  After spending $20/meal all up and down the strip  it is nice to get a cheap(er) meal.   It is ""street"" eating which means you will eat on the outside of the pizza shop  however by no means is it outdoors.   The pizza itself is good  but not strait from NYC by any means.  It is a nice place to sneak away for a bite for lunch to keep your day moving without having to dedicate 45 mins-1 hour for a meal.   I don't endorse this place a true NYC pizza place  but I do endorse it in having good pizza  at a reasonable price which serves a need for the Vegas tourist at some point during their trip."
Restaurants;Pizza,This pizza was gross.  It was under cooked  and over priced.  I agree with a previous posting that a frozen pizza is better than what they are serving here.  also the village food court inside the NYNY Hotel is very crowded  and not planned well so seating can be hard to find.
Restaurants;Pizza,Whats up with the bad reviews? Do you people not enjoy good pizza? I love the Sicilian style slices  they are huge squares. The place is somewhat hidden in NY NY hotel which is actually kind of nice to go and just hide out and eat.   The seating outside is nice  it makes you feel like you are really in NY.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place started off my Vegas trip right...as a NYer  I'm constantly in the hunt for NY pizza  and to see that they have sicilian slices was AMAZING (if you're from NY you know the diff between that and the regular pie).  They do lose a star for their sicilian only being so so.  The crust left room for improvement.  And the pizza and beer combo...really can you go wrong with that?  I think not!    If only they had had cannolis available when I was there.  Minor ding for being out of those as well.  But I'll be back next visit  and hopefully they'll be fully stocked then.
Restaurants;Pizza,Ugh...the best thing about this is that they are near the piano bar  so you can enjoy the piano bar for free. I came here one evening around 9:30/10ish and there was a line. Luckily it moves quite quickly. However  their selection left much to be desired. They ran out of vegetarian slices  so they offered me a slice of Sicilian vegetarian. They neglected to mention (and I guess I neglected to check) that this is more expensive than a regular slice...More money  less pizza  worse pizza. Great... The crust was all dry and the slice was lukewarm. It probably had been sitting out there all day  since no one except for suckers like me would pay more for less.  I was also craving some greens. They had a mediocre salad selection  actually more options than what they listed on their menu board. Their Caesar salad looked kind of sad  just a bunch of romaine. However  they had a mozzarella  spinach and tomato salad that was actually pretty decent.   Once you get your food  snag a seat around the corner where you can enjoy the piano bar festivities for free.  1 star for the pizza 3 stars for the salad Average: 2 star experience
Restaurants;Pizza,Its the best pizza you are gonna find at 1 AM in Vegas. AVOID SBARRO! Meh!
Restaurants;Pizza,Best pizza in vegas  by far. I always buy by the whole pie. Cheaper to split amongst friends or family. Or take one back to so cal for the drive home. Pepperoni n mushroom with sausage.  Mmmmmm.
Restaurants;Pizza,Went on a Monday for lunch and it was not crowded at all. They also had a wide variety of pizza.  I got the pepperoni and mushroom and it was not good at all. A little on the salty side for my taste. Sure the portion was pretty big but does that even matter if you're not going to finish it?  Meh. Blah. And meh again.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is some of the best pizza I have had in my life. We ate it 2 times in a single day and I tried to go back the next morning  but they werent open yet. Its a huge slice for 5 bucks. How can you beat that?!
Restaurants;Pizza,The pizza was ok  nothing special. But even though pre-packaged I enjoyed their antipasto salad. It had lots of pickled peppers  meat and huge chunks of cheese.
Restaurants;Pizza,Worst slice of pizza i've ever eaten. Burnt and undercooked. It was cold and extremely greasy. I couldn't even hold it in my hand because it was soggy. Toppings were raw!! Spend your $ elsewhere. Pizza here is s*#% to say the least!!
Restaurants;Pizza,I ate a big ol slice of Sausage and cheese pizza before our Zumanity show.  It was really tasty and filling. Pricey but its in the hotel/casino so what do you expect.
Restaurants;Pizza,Sirrico's is found on the inside the New York  New York casino amongst the myriad of other food fronts and bars that make up the internal street scene.  The place is pretty busy and they turn out pizza's in an assembly line like fashion  most likely due to the popular $7.77 promotion---1 slice and a Rolling Rock beer.  Beer was *ice* cold (nice)  but pizza slice was 'meh' at best.  It looked better than it tasted which was a shame...I hate to say but it just reminded me of DiGiorno frozen pizzas you get at the supermarket.  That being said  the premium pizza's and thick casserole style pizzas look much  much better.  If I find myself there again  I'll opt to give one of those a try.  The line moves at a pretty decent clip and there's the traditional variety of toppings to choose from.  They have a few different beer options  and also sell wine (cheap variety..think screw cap or boxed) by the glass.
Restaurants;Pizza,It's like $8 for a beer and slice of pizza. How anyone can complain about that being overpriced is beyond me.   Don't be insane and expect that this is going to be NYC quality slice. This is just a good slice of pizza at a reasonable price. If you're looking for higher end pizza in Vegas you've got plenty of options.  Some customers were slamming the counters and screaming at the staff for no reason and the staff handled it very professionally. They probably deal with their a lot of drunks and I think it would be hard to remain patient like that. Respect to the staff.
Restaurants;Pizza,Came here on Feb 6th 2011   I guess with all the mixed reviews it really depends if you get a fresh batch of pizzas opposed to the ones that been sitting there.  That day I went I ordered 1 slice of Sicilian pepperoni for $5.13 tax included and it was fairly large and it was fresh and quite good.  Pretty nice crunch to it  along with the cheese and pepperoni   best square type Sicilian pizza I've had (havent had too many).  One thing I'd like to point out is all the slices are not equal so ensure if they select a slice for you and the other ones look bigger/better dont be afraid to ask for another slice instead of the default they give you.  After all your paying for it  not them   so they wouldnt care lol..  I'll be back here to try it again sometime.
Restaurants;Pizza,"The bf & I saw Cirque du Soleil's ""Zumanity"" and when the show let out  I was starving. It was close to midnight & there was still a short line outside this pizza joint. I ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza & a drink ($8) and the pizza was not bad at all. It tasted very fresh  despite us going there right before they closed  the sauce was tangy and it was a pretty good sized slice for the price.   If I ever find myself stumbling out of another sexually charged show & am hungry  I won't hesitate to stop at this place for another slice."
Restaurants;Pizza,"Stopped in to Sirrico's for a couple slices.  I was impressed.  Not a bad ""NY"" pizza slice.  The crust was done pretty darn nicely (thin  chewy with some slight charring on the bottom).  The sauce was good as was the cheese.  Overall  not a bad slice of pie.  I'd put it a notch below Secret Pizza.....but it's actually a pretty nice pie  especially if you like the  ""NY"" pizza style (thin  foldable crust with an emphasis on the cheese)"
Restaurants;Pizza,Was ok for pizza in a big hotel on the strip but was quite expensive 3 slices and 2 sodas came to $25 dollars Yikes!!!
Restaurants;Pizza,We were staying at the New York New York and after walking the strip for a few hours we needed a good snack. As other customers were walking by and had great looking slices of pizza we said oh yeah! We had to try it. The pizza is a decenct price and the slices are huge. For $6.50 we got a slice of pizza and a cup of beer. They also sell whole pizzas for a reasonable price.The pizza was awesome! Especially the crust. The only draw back was I personally would have liked a tad more sauce. Great service and food!! Will definitely eat there again!
Restaurants;Pizza,Probably one of the worst slices of pizza I've ever had.  The line was ridiculously long  and they didn't have any regular cheese pizza slices  so I had to get a slice of sicilian  which was doughy  tasteless  and underdone.  My dad got a slice of pepperoni pizza  which was also underdone.  His caesar salad was awful as well.  We were lucky enough to at least get a table  but we could've gone to McDonald's and left more satisfied.
Restaurants;Pizza,We were staying at the Excalibur & originally thought we would head to New York New York to get food from Shake Shack  however pizza sounded really good. They were pulling out fresh pizzas from the oven at Sirrico's just as we walked in.  I ended up getting a deep dish pizza with pepperoni & mushrooms and my fiance got a deep dish pizza with the veggie toppings. Both pizzas tasted fresh  had quite a few toppings  and had stringy gooey cheese. At 1am  they definitely hit the spot!  I will say that when we walked in  I hadn't look at the prices per slice. To my surprise  the total for two was a little bit over $15! They had a special for $7-some for a slice of pizza & a beer but I didn't realize that until after we had already paid. It was only about 70 cents extra for the beer so I'd probably get one next time. Overall  an okay choice to grab a bite if it's late  but not one I would choose when other options are available.
Restaurants;Pizza,Delicious. Hot. Fresh!!  I would recommend the Sicilian style pizza over New York style.  It's the square shaped pieces with a thicker  fluffier  more buttery crust.  We shared a slice of the italian sausage and tomato pizza that just came out the oven.  OMG.   One slice and and a soda drink was $10.  Pretty pricey  but hey  it's Vegas.  I would come back again if I was at New York New York Casino & Hotel.
Restaurants;Pizza,Not the best pizza I've ever had  but it'll do when the carb cravings hit you when you're low on energy while gambling. Ernesto hooked me up with some items that I didn't even order. How nice. Extra star for that!  FOOD - Pepperoni pizza: I hope this doesn't represent NYC  because if it does  I've had better from Domino's. Just a bland  greasy  unremarkable pizza. + Garlic bread sticks: Decent  nothing ground breaking. - Lasagna: It was okay  but after a few bites in  your stomach may start to turn from the grease. + NY Style Cheesecake: Not bad. Satisfied my sweet tooth.  NOTES - Cafeteria style: You pick what slice you want and they reheat it in the oven. + Open weekdays till 3AM  and 4AM on weekends + Located inside the NYNY Hotel & Casino + Piano bar nearby  CONCLUSION I think I'll find something better along the Vegas Strip.
Restaurants;Pizza,New York-New York and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. Sirrico's Pizza is the New York  pizzeria in New York - New York's Greenwich Village. A couple of Saturday's previous  this transplanted New Yorker would put Sirrico's to the test.     It was a busy Saturday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Walking from Fashion Show Mall towards Mandalay Bay  I was up to a light dinner. Secret Pizza was packed. So  I'd drop into New York -New York to finally try Sirrico's Pizza. I'd seen there sign advertising a slice of pizza with a beer for $7.77. However  I never saw the pizza up close. It did not look too appealing. Something about it sitting under the lights. The presentation of the food from the pizza to the pasta  reminded me more of Sbarraros than a legendary pizza parlor from New York. I opted out of pizza and ordered the meatball sub.   When I ordered the meatball sub  the cook informed me that it would take five minutes. No sweat! I'd take in the detailed replica of Greenwich Village. I have always admired New York - New York's attention to the New York -New York motif from the steam coming out of a manhole cover to the balconies up above. Way above me  I'd overhear the careening Manhattan Express roller coaster. Down the cobblestone street  Billy Kraus belted out the classics in the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar. In a New York -New York moment time goes fast.    The meatball sub failed to put me in a New York state of mind. It just wasn't very good. Honestly  the meatball marinara at Subway is better. I appreciated that they spent five minutes making the meatball sub. The upshot is that the cheese was hot and delectable. However  I had a below average opinion of the meatballs  which they did give a generous amount of. As I stated earlier in this review  the majority of the food is sitting in trays under lights. This includes the meatballs. When he made my meatball sub  it appeared that he took the meatballs from the tray and reheated it. The outcome was a sub made up of warm and tasty cheese with uninspiring meatballs on ordinary tasting bread. By the time I finished the meatball sub  it was obvious that I will ride the Manhattan Express before ordering it again.    In conclusion  I understand  that New York-New York  and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. However  I believe that a world renown resort of New York -New York's stature needs a New York renown pizzaria.
Restaurants;Pizza,I actually went there last week hoping to get a pizza  but when I saw how large the slices were compared to how small my appetite was I knew I had to order something else. Luckily for me  they had lasagna on the menu. I thought it was completely delicious. I don't think it was worth $9  but more like $7. I would definitely go there again.
Restaurants;Pizza,Came here for a slice before Zumanity and the pizza was terrible - cold  bland  with a couple of desiccated mushrooms and tasteless tomato sauce. All that for $5.75 a slice -- avoid.
Restaurants;Pizza,I like Vegas because there were so many late night dining places all within a 1-mile radius.  This place was no exception.  It's open until 3am (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw) and it was busy no matter the time of day/night.  For a short wait  you can get a gooey  cheesy NY (or Sicilian) slice of pizza.  My brother  boyfriend and I were famished after the boxing match and decided to just take food in our hotel room.  We figured that a slice wasn't going to cut it so we ordered an entire NY-style pepperoni and sausage pie (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=sAb47uEcSjK3uQcylhkhPw).  We had to wait 20 minutes but it was well worth it - hot and fresh out of the oven.  It wasn't greasy than most pizzas so I didn't get the overstuffed feeling afterwards.  It definitely hit the spot. And the price tag on this colossal wide  thin and foldable slice was pretty reasonable in my opinion (about $3/NY  $4/Sicilian or $15/pie).  TIP:  Don't let the long line fool you; it goes by pretty fast unless you order a whole pie which takes about 20 minutes.
Restaurants;Pizza,My son wanted pizza and garlic bread.  The garlic bread was hard as a rock. This could have gone the wrong way but they exchanged it for another slice of pizza for him.  Food was average but they get 4 stars for stepping up and handling the situation properly.
Restaurants;Pizza,Located in the New York New York Casino.  This pizza joint resemble NYC with the NY atmosphere from the  decor and the music from the piano bar next to the pizza restaurant.  The pizza is delicious and taste like the pizza from the Bronx.  The large pizza slice  thin crust  and sauce resemble the same taste and texture from NYC.  This is one of my favorite eatery spot when I go to Vegas. Go CUSE!!
Restaurants;Pizza,"I'm actually a bit surprised at all the negative reviews on this place  but I do have to agree that long lines and inconsistent quality are the main culprits. However  whenever I'm in Vegas and anywhere near NY NY hotel  I try to make it to Sirrico's. But I don't necessarily come away buying a slice of pizza. Let me explain.   If you are absolutely craving any type of pizza and you see a long line  then by all means wait it out. But if there's no line  go to the counter and check out the pizza on display. Does the crust look pale and lifeless? Does the pizza look fresh? Or does it look like it's been sitting out for a couple hours  looking cold and limp? I don't know about you  but if I'm forking over $4-5 for a slice  and waiting in line  it'd better be worth it. I've had pizza in New York and in the east coast  and I know what I want.   The key is to get a slice that is piping hot  straight from the oven. Look for the crust to be slightly charred  and should look crispy. Sometimes you'll ask for a sausage or mushroom  and the dude will give you their wannabe ""New York"" attitude and say they don't have any. Just brush it off. It doesn't matter  make a small sacrifice and just take whatever type of pizza that just came from the oven. Wait if you have to. Usually it's pepperoni. They almost always have pepperoni."
Restaurants;Pizza,Get the sicilian square pizza. More toppings and a better crust. Lively atmosphere with no frills. Quick and cheap.  Located across from the barin times square in the new york new york hotel. This place is conveinent for a quick meal. This particular alley is wonderful to eat at at night because theres amazing performers at the bar in times square. Compared to nyc pizzeria. The pizza here is fresher and is even cheaper too. I came here for lunch and all the pizzas were freshly baked out of the oven and were hot and crisp. At nyc it appeared the cheese was getting cold and almost all the pizza looked old.  The pizza here is cafeteria style. You order and they give it to you and you pay at the cashier. There is plenty of seating outside of this place which is a lively space. Price wise. Food is cheap. A slice of pizza ranges for $4.95 to $6.95. Not bad if youre on a budget or need a quick meal inbetween sight seeing.  Taste wise. The pizza id deceiving. Loaded with garlic it was a very tasty first bite. I was not expecting such a garlicy flavour and it was very yummy without being bitter. There were shakers of garlic seasoning with the parmesan so i assume this was their trademark. If you dont like garlic. This pizza isnt for you.  I shared a slice of traditional and sicilian square slices. The traditional slice was very thin and had generous  toppings on it..i had ordered the chicken artichoke and is was delicious. Garlicy with that bite without being bitter. The pie was slightly crisp and it tasted good. It was not as light as i would of liked but for $5. It was a steal.   The sicilian square dough was better in my books. It is a thicker deep dish crust which held together better than the other pizza. It was more like a huge cheese breadstick. And how can bread and cheese go wrong. My advice. Pay the extra dollar and splurge for the sicilian style pizzas. The toppings were more generous on this pizza too bc the crust could hold more toppings and despite being loaded with cheese. The crust was crisp and fluffy in the middle. It was very good. I wish they made this in the chicken artichoke flavour as the flavour was great but i liked the deep dish pizza better than the thin crust. For $6.50 you cannot go wrong. Especially with the las vegas strip inflated prices.
Restaurants;Pizza,"Came here for a convention weekend. So as someone looking for a quick bite to eat before heading back for a convention  I ditched MGM's busy food court and came here. I mean after all  its not too far away (New York New York is only a connector bridge thingy away!  So I wanted pizza  something quick and easy. Found this place as I was quickly scouting for a place to eat here in NYNY. Saw this place and decided to give it a try. I should have looked up the yelp reviews because I was not impressed. This pizza was not good at all. The crust was too thick (on all the ones they had  it was thick crust)  and I am not a thick crust fan. Plus I know its Vegas in all and things on the strip on generally more expensive...but for 7 bucks a slice  it was not worth it.  I had the pepperoni since they had no combination. It was just ""eh!"". I would NOT come back here again. If only PH was closer cuz a Earl of Sandwich would have sounded SO much better then this nasty pizza. For a square shaped pizza  that was not good and overpriced  I wouldn't come back. Though I'd mite consider trying the lasagna if I did have to come back.  I give this place 2 stars. If your ever in vegas  PLEASE YELP before your eat at any place. Yes  even if your in a rush and too busy to look up a place to eat  NOT a fan."
Restaurants;Pizza,Located in the Village Food Court area of the New York New York Hotel & Casino. This is a counter service restaurant with various pizza slices and a few other Italian food items. If you want to grab a quick bite  this is worth a stop.
Restaurants;Pizza,"I really didn't care that it was ""New York"" style pizza or compare it to it.  I just thought it was pretty good pizza.  I had the sicilian style also which I thought was great.  But then again  after walking up and down the strip all day starving  I guess anything would be!"
Restaurants;Pizza,Went to this place coz shake shack was closed and we were checked in new york new york. I ordered 4 traditional pizzas and lasagna. Both tasted good. The service however was horrible. The cashier over charged me  he punched the wrong order and when I called out he discrepancy he didn't admit and kept insisiting I was wrong. The cashier kept speaking to me in spanish which I couldn't understand. He seemed irritated and insisting the price was correct. The pizza was 5.95 and my receipt said 6.50. He said it includes the tax.  The line was getting long so I just gave up and went to eat. When we finished and the line was gone I went back to clarify that tax was not included in the price and he still didn't admit his mistake.  He started pointing to the tip jar and was throwing a dollar in a very insulting gesture - which was apparently the difference in total. I just said he could keep the dollar and I looked for their manager. The manager apologized. I felt humiliated so we just we left and told ghe rest of our group to never to eat at that place again.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is one of my go-to places for pizza in Vegas. I love the Sicilian-style pizzas here! The breadsticks are also really soft  garlicky and yummy
Restaurants;Pizza,We stopped in after clubbing at Tao Beach and met up with some new friends from our flight down.   Pizza slices are large and the crust is on the thick side. Not my cup of tea but at 2am when you're slightly inebriated and all you want are carbs then this is a good place.   Also the cobblestone walkways of New York  New York were wreaking havoc on my girlfriends feet so sitting down at the table and chairs was a great choice  especially for the people watching.   New York  New York if you are reading this review  please install moving pedways that look like cobblestone walkways. You'd revolutionize getting around in Las Vegas.   Thanks for reading.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is overrated. I always see long lines and people raving about this pizza. if you see the pizza im used to eating this is as good as Papa Johns. The price for a whole pie is $15 for a cheese and thats CHEAP for Vegas. If you have a bunch of friends on a tight budget this may be the spot for you otherwise...walk right by it. I give Sirrico's a 66/100
Restaurants;Pizza,I don't know why people are bashing this place so much...  It seems like any time that I go to Vegas  I end up eating here at least once.  I think the pizza is pretty good.  It's not terrible.  It is pretty hard to f-up a piece of pizza  ya know?  Even bad pizza is still good.  Maybe I am just easy to please.  Who knows...  It's definitely 'A-Ok' in a pinch and if you're starving.  I would recommend it.  And  I would definitely eat here again next time I go.
Restaurants;Pizza,Hands down the tastiest pizza I've ever come across in vegas when have little time to eat.  Quick and easy and accepts mlife comps.  I have never walked into NYNY and not stopped here. You can't beat Sicilian Chicago-style Deep Dish.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place could easily put New York pizzeria out of business. The location is less accessible but the quality in food and service is beyond comparison.
Restaurants;Pizza,WE eat here every time we go to Vegas. My picky eater husband loves the Lasagna! I am always torn between ordering pizza or lasagna. Always good for a quick inexpensive meal to mix in with all the other Vegas choices. We are going in September and will for sure be stopping by!
Restaurants;Pizza,Definitely a quick bite place. I think the pizza is very good  one slice get me full. Overall pizza is good and the price very good... Open til 3am =]
Restaurants;Pizza,I gave them 2 stars for being open late. The pizza was awful and I am from NYC. Please change the receipe for the crust and add some more cheese  how can you represent NY and have bad pizza???
Restaurants;Pizza,If you're staying in the MGM or NYNY  this is THE place for a night time snack to make the next morning feel less bad. It's open till forever and the slices are thick  big  and the right amount of greasy. The piano bar is next door so you'll be treating to some live music with your slice. Yes it's $5 for a slice and you'll need two but it's small price to pay for convenience and feeling ok the next morning. The whole pie is a much better deal but if you can wait the 25 minutes  you probably don't need it and can get a more quality pie elsewhere :)
Restaurants;Pizza,"I've had a couple slices here on several occasions.  They serve large slices of tasty pies that will fill you up without breaking the bank.  Service has always been quick.  I was in and out in a jiffy.  There's plenty of seating available on the faux ""sidewalk"" outside the exit.  You can sit there and watch the roller coaster come back into the station while you are eating."
Restaurants;Pizza,Why does everyone hate this place?  The pizza is good!  There was no line when we showed up  but there was when we left.  Three hungry guys decided to order a whole mushroom pie instead of individual slices.  They quoted us a wait of 20 minutes  but it turned out to be 35  and we had to harrass them a few times.  We suspected that they used our first pie to dole out slices to the lunch crowd.  Fuckers.  But it was worth the wait  because the pizza was damn good New York style  and a nice value at $16 for 8 slices.  And yeah--my friends each ate only two slices  so I ate the other four.  What's it to you?  (Ha ha  I'm practicing my New York attitude.)
Restaurants;Pizza,Eeeeeee... Maybe it wasn't that tasty because it was 1 am and I cannot say how long my slice had been sitting out. But um  not good.  We pretty much stumbled into New York New York and decided we needed some food in our bodies. Most of the other decent looking places in the Casino were closed  and so pizza it was. We tried ordering a whole pie to share between our group -- but the wait time was 45 minutes which was ridiculous so we just grabbed whatever slices were available.  $4.50 later I was noshing on a rubbery sad piece of cheese pizza. No amount of extra parmesan or chili flakes could redeem said pizza. I didn't even eat the crust -- which if you know me is one of my favorite things on a piece of pie. I can see why Bourdain was horrified with this place -- just mediocre and not worth the hefty price tag. Casino inflation or no.
Restaurants;Pizza,I typically don't review pizza places because  well  basically LA pizza is pure garbage. I've been all over Southern Cali looking for the good stuff and it always turns out to be over hyped and over priced cardboard.  I love going to the NYNY hotel for the ambiance and this particular pizza joint. It's nestled between a steakhouse  Chinese restaurant  piano bar and a deli. The pizza here is so delicious that I crave it often but unfortunately I live 300 miles away. For $4 you get a big piece of quality pizza that truly is reminiscent of The big Apple! Foldable  nice yeasty dough  perfect amount of toppings (mushroom is my favorite) and cute lasagnas that come in the little square tin container it was baked in. I typically like to have my slice(s) put back into the oven for a minute to make it a little crunchier but their slices are not typically soggy/saggy in nature.   You can take your slice out to the tables that sit amongst the New York themed corridor...cool feeling indeed!   Big plus because they are open until 3am!!!!  Get a slice or take a whole pie back to your room and enjoy.
Restaurants;Pizza,The first thing I like about this place is that they are open until 3am on Sunday. I was hungry late at night and there aren't many options after 10 or 11 usually on the strip.  We were going to try shake shak a couple doors down but the line looked long and I didn't want to wait (But we won't leave vegas without trying shake shak). I had the lasagna which comes with garlic bread and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the slice of pizza with beer deal ($7.77) and that was also good! I'm glad we came here to eat. (Located inside the NY NY hotel near the piano bar).
Restaurants;Pizza,Yes - not my favorite place in NYNY.  We actually had a better slice upstairs when Nathan's Hotdogs is.  This is a line type restaurant.  When you approach the line you will see all of the pizza options you have to choose from.  We opted for a regular cheese slice and a slice of sicilian (thick crust) with meatball and pep.  First of all the cheese slice was cold and just not good at all.  The crust wasn't even tasty and I typically like to eat the crust.  The sicilian was a bit better but both my husband and I felt sick about twenty minutes after eating.  We had not had anything prior.  All in all I was say that there are many other better choices at this hotel.  They do have a special which includes a slice and cup of Rolling Rock beer for $7.77.
Restaurants;Pizza,Just stopped in for a late night snack.  The Pizza was good but certainly not the best I have ever had.   They have regular and Sicilian and both tasted pretty good.  If you need a quick bite after midnight its most definitely an option.
Restaurants;Pizza,Love the pizza here! I always stop and grab a slice of this New York style pizza. It's in the food court of the New York New York hotel. You get in line and they serve you cafeteria style and you get your drink and pay at the end. You can't sit in the restaurant itself  but there is plenty of seating in the food court. Come by and have a slice.
Restaurants;Pizza,Nice spot for a quick bite before going to see Zumanity! The pizza was hot and fresh and the slice was huge!   I haven't been to the real NYC yet but I imagine this is similar to what they have there and for me I really enjoyed the pizza!
Restaurants;Pizza,I will say this place  when in need of a quick bite that pretty tasty  this place fits the bill. Super quick service  and the food soooooo good! I had a plain cheese pizza  the bf had a pepperoni pizza and we split a Greek salad. All in all...hot greasy goodness!!! Yummmmm!!
Restaurants;Pizza,Not too bad and semicheap for lunch.  The slices are huge and tasty.  One bad thing - the other patrons we were behind in line - have you ever been through a line where you pick food and move on down  quickly?!?  Geez  I felt like I was behind a bunch of idiots that have never been outside their home.  But anyway the pizza was pretty tasty and its in the cool New York New York Hotel so you can feel like you are (somewhat) in the city!  Good  cheap eats.
Restaurants;Pizza,Fast and good and decent prices for Vegas. That's all I'm writing because if you're reading this you're probably drunk. Have fun!
Restaurants;Pizza,I grew up in the burbs of New York and have a decent understanding of New York style pizza.  I had a slice of the four cheese pizza at Sirrico's and it was pretty good.  The crust was a little bland and undercooked  but the thickness and taste had more of a New York quality than the stuff that I find at home in New England.  A slice was $5  but the slice was larger than average and was best consumed when folded in half.  They also had sicilian pizza  which is sort of an unknown in most of the country.  I would have liked to try that too  but I just needed a snack and one slice was enough for me.
Restaurants;Pizza,The pizza here tasted really  really good. The bad? It gave me a mild case of food poisoning. Totally gross.  So... three stars to Sirrico's for letting me enjoy a nice  gooey slice of pizza while making me feel skinny the next day.
Restaurants;Pizza,If you're at New York New York  you have to grab some pizza! For a little over $4  you get a pretty big slice (there's a pretty good array of different pizzas too!); after you pay  grab a seat outside  where you feel like you're in New York! I enjoyed eating here for the atmosphere...I didn't feel like the pizza was spectacular or anything...  I saw quite a few people order whole pizzas and take them up to their room...not a bad idea. Pizza party in the room with beer anyone?
Restaurants;Pizza,I was expecting a crappy pizza.  Instead I was amazed to discover one of the best sauces I've ever had.  The Sicilian style pizza was a bit too doughy  so I'd probably stick to the standard slice.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is good if you want a quick and cheap bite to eat. They are also open very late so it's convenient. I usually get the Sicilian pizza because you can get full off one slice. If you are a Hawaiian Pizza lover don't bother because they don't carry Pineapples ....I keep checking every time I go. The Pizza is all pre made they will have choices like pepperoni  vegetarian   cheese but nothing extravagant. When you choose your slice they just reheat it for you. They also offer garlic bread  and salads as side items. It's perfect if you are on the run and don't have a lot of time on your hands.
Restaurants;Pizza,It's ok pretty fresh and the prices are good. Not the best pizza I ever tasted or the worst. Didn't find anything special about it. Its good if your drunk and its open late.
Restaurants;Pizza,I got a slice of pepperoni  and my boyfriend got a slice of meat-lovers supreme  or something like that. It was $18! I was shocked  that's pretty expensive pizza. It was delicious though. I do love a good New York Style pizza and this one was lovely. However  I can get meals like that elsewhere for cheaper. Still good though.
Restaurants;Pizza,"My Bestie and I have to go here when we go to vegas. WE HAVE TO.maybe its just because of all the drunk memories... but we HAVE TO. lol.  sure  its just pizza. but who cares when the crust is amazing...lol. its about 5 bucks a slice. average for vegas. im just plain jane when i come here. i jsut get the pepperoni slice. and im satisfied.  make sure the guy heats it up for u so its sizzling.   sure  the people there arent hella friendly. but when ur drunk  who gives a shit. as long as ur not in my face. we're friends. lol  sure  u have to sit ""outside"" where the tables arent always clean  but who cares when u have bomb pizza in front of u.  sure  i lost my credit card around here before  but who cares when the crunchy and chewy crust is waiting to be gobbled up.  sigh  ill be back. memories and pizza on the streets on New York New York"
Restaurants;Pizza,When In New York you should stop for a slice of pizza; Therefore  when in New York   New York Casino in Las Vegas  Nevada you might as well do the same.  Every time I go to Vegas I find myself at this place at some point during my trip.  I do not recommend getting any old slices because they are not good.  However  any slice fresh out of the oven is really good for a good price....okay....lets just say a good price for the Vegas Strip.
Restaurants;Pizza,Good pizza  and open till 3 a.m.  Great staff even in the wee hours.  Partway through my square  I realized the bottom was burnt (it wasn't in the corner I started on)  and hubby took it back  asked for a new slice  and had no problem whatsoever getting it replaced.  Everyone was really nice  from the cashier to the people behind the counter  to the guy cleaning tables!
Restaurants;Pizza,One of my favorite places to hit late night after a night of drinking in Vegas.  Been coming here for years and I strategically try to stay in a hotel nearby so that it can be my last stop of the evening.  Open real late and incredibly reasonable prices  especially for Vegas.  Service is good and it's always fun to get a cheap slice or two at the end of a long night to eat at the tables or in your room.  They have a choice of NY style pizza and Sicilian style foccacia bread pizza.  I had the latter twice this trip and each time it satisfied.  For some reason  I didn't enjoy it as much as previous trips  but it was still good.  Perhaps next time  I'll try the NY style thin crust pizza instead.  It's nothing fancy  but hard to fault an inexpensive pizza by the slice place that's open late on the strip.
Restaurants;Pizza,One of the few places open late. There were two guys looking at a pizza in the oven when I got there  they looked at me and kept checking the pizza. Guess the pizza was more important than greeting a customer.(the oven is right in the front)  Then another guy came from the back and just looked at me  so I took it he would help me. Told him which slice I wanted. Asked if anything else. No  so I proceeded to the cashier.  The guy and girl by the beer tap right before the cashier were too busy talking to each other to ask if I wanted anything to drink.   Went to cashier grabbed a soda from the fridge  paid and got the hell outta there!   Customer service  non existant. Pizza just alright. If there was another choice to eat I would've gone there instead.
Restaurants;Pizza,I absolutely love this place. It was a go to on my last Vegas trip when we got back to the hotel. It's located inside the New York New York Hotel. I recommend the NY style  it's excellent.   They're also open till around 3am  so it's perfect for a late night snack!
Restaurants;Pizza,The line to eat pizza here was simply amazing.  I think that there were more people waiting to get a slice of pie than there were at all the slot machines on the floor of New York  New York.  Of course  it seemed like they were doing some kind of remodeling  so that could have had something to do with it.  At any rate  the wait really wasn't worth it.  The pizza was okay  and it wasn't terribly pricey  but I won't really say that it was very good either.  You do get to select from a few slices  and the overall taste is decent.  The good news is that you don't have to wait (other than the aforementioned line  which does fluctuate).  That's an important factor at certain times  like when you are just tired of walking around and around and trying to find something to eat.  The bad news is that you then have to figure out where to eat it  and there are only a handful of tables to sit at in the Little Italy section of the casino  and most of them are always full.  Even if you get to sit  you get to listen to a really bad piano bar across the way.  It'll do in a pinch  but it's just not that great.
Restaurants;Pizza,Slices were noticeably smaller my visit last week.  Pizza was still good  but cheaping out and shrinking your slices to improve profits on already expensive slices is going to cost you a star.
Restaurants;Pizza,Nothing better than a bunch of pizza to ease a night of debauchery. Decent cheap pizza by the slice in New York or Sicilian styles and a decent cannolli.
Restaurants;Pizza,So delicious. Will definitely eat here again. The line went out the door  and there were no trays left (cafeteria style) because they were slammed at 2am!!!
Restaurants;Pizza,"Located inside the New York New York Hotel & Casino  I have to say that Sirrico's Pizza is probably the best deal for food you will get on the strip.  With prices starting out at around $3 and getting a whole pizza for around $16  if you're hungry and looking for something filling at a cheap price  this is your stop.  They offer 2 different types of Pizza ""Traditional"" which is more of your NY style thin crust slice or ""Sicilian"" which is more like a forroccia style slice and they have about 5 or 6 different styles of each pizza ready to be served.  They also offer some pasta  sandwiches  and salads.  Sirrico's Pizza is run like a lunch counter  you pick what you want  slide your tray over and pay at the register.  Not much to it.  I decided to get a ""traditional"" slice of pepperoni pizza.  They guy gave me a huge piece and paid for it and found a seat around the corner.  Took a bit into it and have to say it was alright.  The crust was thin  but not like a cracker so you can easily fold it in half  they were a bit light on the sauce for my taste and very heavy on the cheese.  There was also a good amount of pepperoni on it  so I'm glad they didn't skimp on that.  It wasn't the best pizza I've had  but in Vegas for about $3 and good portion size  I honestly couldn't complain.  It made for a good 3:30 in the after noon late lunch before dinner at 8PM and filled me up.  Overall  yes I would come back because the pizza wasn't half bad and their prices better than most things you would get in Vegas.  It did the job and the job well  normally I would rate someplace like Sirrico's Pizza at 3 stars  but considering the portion and value especially compared to all the other places in Vegas that way over charge you  it's worth rounding up to 4 stars.  If you're looking for something cheap  reasonable  and filling  Sirrico's Pizza is probably one of the best values you will find in Vegas  4 stars."
Restaurants;Pizza,I eat here almost every time I go to Vegas and it's always been good. Thin crust pizza and honestly not even casino ripoff prices if you grab a whole pie (~$20). If this place was where I live I'd probably pick it over almost all of the local pizza places . Honestly eating here is a nice change of pace from the typical food you get in Vegas and a great place to grab a bite on a budget.
Restaurants;Pizza,My wife and I stopped and shared a slice.  OUTSTANDING!  One of the best NY style pizzas I've ever had. Crust was perfect!  Nice crunch on the bottom and perfect amount of chew.....I'm ready to go back!
Restaurants;Pizza,Direct from NY.  My wife was born and raised in the big apple and has struggled with pizza places in Las Vegas.  We haven't found a problem finding good  traditional pizza  but for her Sicilian style  she has yet to find one  until we went to Sirrico's.  Closest she's felt to home in a while.  It was good  not stellar and their traditional is good as well.  Great option.  Pricey  I recommend buying a pie instead of just s slice.
Restaurants;Pizza,Their pizza is VERY good! Love their Sicilian style pizza. I haven't tried any of their other menu offerings  but will do so next time I'm there.  I bent the rules a bit. When you leave the pizza shop  turn left and sit on a little cafe` table around the corner in front of Gallagher's restaurant. They offer a full bar and a wider selection of beer. The cafe` tables are a great place to people watch  too.
Restaurants;Pizza,I have been craving some great pizza for weeks. I did a search on Yelp and Travel Advisor to see where they say the best pizza in Vegas is. Sirrico's came up on top of both. I don't mind that it is a pizza by the slice place. That is all I wanted. I wanted to try a few so I got a slice if sausage and a slice of pepperoni. There were about eight or so people in front of me in line. One thing I didn't understand was why only one register was open. It took me about ten minutes to be rung up. There goes my piping hot pizza.  I ate the sausage first. The sauce was very tasty  as well as the cheeses and sausage. The crust had a good taste to it but was limp as all get outs. There was no crunch to it at all. Next on to the pepperoni. Again the crust was so limp. The pepperoni was some of the best I've had on the west coast. Not to spicy but full of flavor. But the best in Vegas it is far from. If you are at the New York  New York it would be ok to try it out. But don't make a special trip. It is only ok.
Restaurants;Pizza,I think this is a great spot for thin crust NY style pizza. I love that they're open until 3 am!  Wish the line wasn't always so long.
Restaurants;Pizza,I wouldn't stop here by choice  but my friends thought they'd find authentic New York pizza at New York New York  so here I was. It's cute they thought that  but I warned them it's not true. The pizza is good enough for a drunk individual who believes they are in New York City while stumbling through here.   I tried the thick and thin crust  and was not impressed by either. The thin crust was decidedly MUCH better  but is not what I recall of New York City. It's not fresh unless you happen to make it there as they pull one out of the oven  and sadly  they did not reheat my slices that had been out for a while. It's busy here  like an assembly line  so you better know what you want  and know it fast. If you're in a rush and don't care  perfect place for you.
Restaurants;Pizza,Right on the strip you can get a big square thick crust slice of pizza for 3.48 cents. The pizza is decent and they also serve manicotti  lasagna  and salads. Decently priced  okay food right on the strip-- enough said.
Restaurants;Pizza,Every time I go to Las Vegas I make sure I stop by Sirrico's for two slices of pizza and a beer. The place is centrally located smack down in the middle of NYNY. The pizza is fantastic and is reasonably priced for Vegas. The slices are huge  juicy  and quite flavorful. And you can pick up a slice anytime of day. Afternoon after sweating your buns off walking the strip  at dawn after seeing the neens and peens bounce around after watching Zummanity  or three in the morning after being denied booty from a tranny midget.     The only thing that sucks is the staff. You can tell they hate their job. I have a feeling there is a tough old Italian woman back there with a giant belt who beats them regularly.
Restaurants;Pizza,I do not recall ever having authentic NY Pizza  until trying this place. I went the first time on a friends recommendation. I went the second time  the next day  because it was that good.   I tried both the square sausage and the cheese pizzas. I preferred the sausage better but the the bread was equally soft on both. It was the perfect dough. I think I preferred the sausage better because it was a bit more fresh than the cheese. The cheese pizza was possibly sitting longer in the hot lamp.   Nevertheless  it was good enough for a 2nd visit and future visits.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is usually a go to every time we are in Vegas. Usually I'd give it a 5 star rating. Last Monday we went and the pizza was cold and old. Seemed like it was sitting under the lamps too long. The thick crust pizza was wet and spongy. Was very disappointed this time around.
Restaurants;Pizza,My favorite pizza place on the strip. It's in the middle of New York New York casino  near Gallaghers steakhouse... You can get a square cut that is a thicker crust or a slice which is thinner. Lots of varieties already made and you can also order whole pizzas. Ordering  serving and paying is quick but sometimes there's a long line around dinner or lunch. I find myself coming back over and over again.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is underrated. I've never had pizza this good  and trust me  I've tried a lot of pizza. Don't think twice if you're considering it. It's the best best.
Restaurants;Pizza,Its cheap and open til 3am.   Its not the best pizza Ive had and not the worst.   Its pretty cheap compared to other pizza joints on the strip.  The slices are big and you can get a whole pizza for about 16 bux  which is not bad if you need to feed alot of people...  The workers here are very rude though...I guess they are trying to give it the whole New York feel...lol...All they need to do is start flipping people off...lol..
Restaurants;Pizza,The pizza is very good here  second best pizza I had in Vegas actually.  Ate here twice. The service was fast as well. Plenty of seating around the (ideal) NY themed street.
Restaurants;Pizza,Yummmm. Always good and always open when u need some food before bed. Love the pizza. Always hot and fresh. Never had a bad piece of pizza from here :-)
Restaurants;Pizza,Yummy!!! Great pizza! 1 slice will definitely fill you up. I tried pepperoni and sausage. My hubby tried pepperoni slice. We were both pretty surprised on how good it was!
Restaurants;Pizza,I've been here a few times and the pizza is always  fresh  hot  and tasty...especially for a place on the strip. The prices aren't bad either for  a large slice in Vegas so this place is perfect for a quick bite on the strip.
Restaurants;Pizza,All three times I've came to Vegas  I've ate at Sirrico's pizza. The pizza is good  but it's even better when your buzzed/drunk coming out of a nightclub. LOL. Next time your trying to find a place to eat after the club  go to Sirrico's. Your stomach will thank you for it.
Restaurants;Pizza,"I've been going to this place for years and years  and this year was a bust.  For four sicilian slices  the price was $26 and the pizza wasn't hot  fresh or tasty.  The yahoo behind the counter ""Michael"" seemed terribly annoyed that we asked him for pizza  though that is his entire job.  Take spatula  scoop up slice  put on plate and hand to customer.  Apparently that was too much work for him.  I can get past a less than ideal slice  but someone behind the counter who doesn't want to be there should just go scrub toilets!"
Restaurants;Pizza,This place never disappoints me. We eat here every time in Vegas. Either our 1st meal or our last. Some times even twice.    I'm not saying it's the best pizza ever but it is good. I love the deep dish square slices.   Lots of other choices beside pizza too.  Service is good. Friendly staff.   Try to Copa De Vino wines too.
Restaurants;Pizza,I actually liked this pizza. I liked this pizza so much I got it twice on my recent Vegas trip: once at midnight  and once for breakfast at 10 am! The trick is to ask the server to re-heat your slice in the oven. The pizza here was like an authentic New York slice. The perfect amount of tasty tomato sauce and the right amount of cheese on a very good  slightly bready but not too thick crust.
Restaurants;Pizza,Really good NY style pizza at where else... New York New York casino!  Don't know about the other two ppl and why they hated this place so much but have tried this place multiple times over the years and again last week and the pizza was delicious and hot as usual.  It is NY style pizza so don't expect anything different - a thin chewy crust that you can fold  flavorful sauce and pepperoni  and oil oozing everything from the top. Our slices came hot (and if it's cold  ask them to throw it into the oven for a couple min)  huge  and were awesome. I think their NY style pizza is better than most I've tried in the SF Bay Area  esp due to their tasty sauce.  Bottom line: If you have to get your NY style pizza in Vegas  Sirrico's in the NYNY casino should hit the spot.
Restaurants;Pizza,This has been a must every year when we visit Vegas. Just got pizza and not a New York pizza as we have had in the past. This pizza was dry and lacking flavor. New York pizza has oil on and flavor  YES  unhealthy but I'm not eating it to be healthy.  I spoke to the manager and the chef  that had to change their recipe to low and no fat cheese because people complained of it being unhealthy  DONT EAT PIZZA if you're looking for healthy food. The do gooders have ruined my pizza hangout.
Restaurants;Pizza,4 stars because it is near the elevators and you can easily grab a slice as you try to stumble back to your room late at night. I think i had at least one slice a day  as it is pretty good pie for being so cheap. I always got the pepperoni and jalapeno. And as everyone knows  it can be super hard finding ANYTHING cheap in Vegas  so i was happy that i didn't have to end my night with a $30 late night snack.
Restaurants;Pizza,I was not pleased with the pizza. I got a slice of sicilian that was under cooked and my boyfriends regular slice was over cooked. We also shared an order of garlic knots that we dry and stale.   We are big pizza fans and both agreed a tombstone pizza is better than this place. And a tombstone is a fraction of the price. If I were you I'd pass this place and go somewhere else.
Restaurants;Pizza,Okay so you're looking for a cheap bite in Vegas this is a great spot. $5 dollars a slice bigger than your plate is not bad but get a whole pizza for $22 that includes 6 slices now we are talking. They sauce has good flavor and the chees almost stretches about 5 inches when you take the first bite. I enjoyed the flavor but don't forget that most dining reviews in Vegas are taken with a grain of salt. Much of us were very intoxicated during this dining experience. I was look enough to be accompanied with two sober family members that both really liked their pizza slices. Drinks and entertainment well it's Vegas so enough said.
Restaurants;Pizza,Decent pizza. You can have the choice of regular or thick crust.   Specially good is that it was open at midnight when nothing else much is open.
Restaurants;Pizza,I was surprised by how good this pizza really is!  I was thinking it was just going to be like mall pizza... however  the toppings are really yummy.  We sometimes go to the New York New York just for the pizza if we get a late-night craving.  They always seem to have pizzas out that have lots of black olives on them (my favorite!!).
Restaurants;Pizza,Why oh why do they never have mushroom pizza on hand??  It's on their menu board and they never  ever have it.  I've been to Sirrico's a handful of times and this time  I was reduced to trying their lasagna  which was entirely too drowned in sauce.  I really want to like this place more.
Restaurants;Pizza,I stopped by here today by myself for a later lunch.  This place is in the restaurants section of New York New York and is reminiscent of a food court.  I decided to go with a single slice of their four cheese pizza which was $5.  Not cheap but about standard for pizza in.casino prices.  The piece of pizza was decent sized and maybe would have been a sixth of a large.  Whenever I first bit into it I was expecting it to at least be warm.  Nope room temperature  awesome.  The under layer of dough was also quite soggy  probably from the grease of the cheese while it was sitting there waiting to be purchased as the back crust was crispy.  The cheese and sauce did little to inspire as well and were utterly forgettable.    The bottom line for me is that I would not stop back here again the future.  The pizza just wasn't that great and there is definitely better pizza to be had in the strip  mostly for a better price.
Restaurants;Pizza,Always tasty pizza!   I love the crust  crunchy  chewy & flavorful.  I will always come back for more : )
Restaurants;Pizza,$7.70 for a slice of pizza and a beer? Don't mind if I do.  A slice is $5.50. Only $2 more for a beer is a steal in Vegas. You really can't NOT do this. The pizza is okay. Nothing special  but it's a cheap and reasonable option in Vegas when you're just looking for a quick  semi-cheap bite to eat.   They had lots of options for pizza toppings. It wasn't fresh out of the oven  but that happens at places where they sell just slices. Especially in Vegas. They're also open super late. Till 3 during weekdays  and till 4 on Friday and Saturday.   The line went quick  and the pizza was alright. They have a beer special too and that's worth it to try out if you're staying in New York!
Restaurants;Pizza,Wow  grabbed a slice on a whim on the way to a show. Was more than impressed. Was delicious! Huge slices  nice fluffy light texture  perfect amount of sauce and cheese. I liked it so much I took a picture of the name of the place so I wouldn't forget. Loved it! Nice friendly staff as well.
Restaurants;Pizza,I LOVVVE the pizza here for a quick late night bite in Vegas!  I go here many nights each visit.  I really do not know why the low star rating...the taste is great  always seems decently fresh  its quick and the crust is to die for ... YUM!
Restaurants;Pizza,Meh is right. The pizza here is a doughy slice of crap  but you can get one with a beer for only $5.75. So  should you find yourself wandering around NY NY late at night  drunk  and in dire need of some sustenance... well  this is a good deal. The pizza will soak up some of the booze in your stomach (thus allowing for more to be imbibed). The beer is Bud Light. Yea  yea... I know  it sucks. But at least it ain't Coors Light or - shudder - Miller. Of course  you'll hopefully be drunk enough that none of this will matter.
Restaurants;Pizza,Overall: Not sure what's up with others but this is hands down the best pizza I've  eatin in Vegas under one stipulation  only if it's fresh out the oven! I love this pizza and beats many local favorites in the bay area.   Plate: I dream about there soft doughy crust and smoking hot melted cheese and slightly crisp pepperonis.  Really really good late night party food.   Recommend: 5 STAR if it's freshly cooked. Make sure lots of people I front if you so you get a slice that just came out! Yes Will be a top Recommendation to anyone visiting Vegas.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is New York style pizza at Las Vegas Strip prices.  No place in New York could get away with $5 a slice since there is great competition all over the place.  In Las Vegas  where most pizza is bad and you are paying casino prices  it will due.  The pizza was okay.  It is better than your Domino's and Papa John's.  But it doesn't compare with any neighborhood pizzeria anywhere within 200 miles of Brooklyn.
Restaurants;Pizza,Kate S. pretty much wrote my review for me (I was in the same group as her and Daren D.)  I also got a slice of cheese and found it similarly disappointing.  I'm a bit of a pizza snob  but tipsy  tired  and post-midnight  I just want it to have some decent flavor.  It had NO flavor  even the crust was bland and unappetizing and I too am a crust-lover.  Even drunk  I have some standards.  Overpriced  unappealing  and it wasn't very hot either.  I usually enjoy the food at NY-NY but I'll be skipping this one in the future.  I had MUCH better pizza upstairs at a place whose name I've forgotten  so I'll go back there next time.  Side rant - 45 minutes for a pizza?  Sure  it needs baking time but more like 20 minutes + 5 to put it together.
Restaurants;Pizza,Do NOT order a whole pizza pie here!!!  You think you're getting a good deal  but you'll be sorry.  We literally waited over 45 minutes for our pizza (they said it would take 15-20 minutes).  After asking several more times and waiting for 20+ more minutes -- during which time they actually yelled at us  lied and claimed that the hold up was due to ordering a half vegetarian  half pepperoni pizza (totally not true considering they told us it was fine when we ordered it) -- we FINALLY received our pizza  and it was completely undercooked!!  UNACCEPTABLE.  I was so annoyed at this point that I took it back and asked them (as nicely as I could muster) to put it back in the oven.  Several minutes of waiting (I'm sensing a pattern here  ha ha)  we finally dug into our pie.  The flavor was okay  but it was still  undercooked.  WTF!  Service at Sirrico's is beyond horrendous.  We were not the only ones who were put through this ordeal.  There were at least 2 other groups waiting for their pies  and everyone was seriously pissed off!  I can't believe this place is still in business.  Stay away at all costs!  Or if you absolutely must have pizza at 3am while you're already in NY NY casino  only order by the slice!!!
Restaurants;Pizza,This pizza is okay. Not bad  not the best  but good enough if you're hungry and in the area. The Sicilian pizza was much better than the thin crust (we got both).   However it does seem overpriced  but I guess that's expected in vegas.
Restaurants;Pizza,Great pizza  and fast service. For the price  it is one of the best restaurants in New York hotel. Will be back in the future
Restaurants;Pizza,"Are you F'n kiddin' me?! This place is shameful  beyond ghetto and a sad excuse for anything remotely close to proper NYC pizza. Was there this summer and craving a slice in the middle of the strip. Shoulda Yelped for one and held off  but caved and settled for an air conditioned quick-fix...hence Sirrico's. The slices seemed thin enough. So we took a chance and ordered up a cheese slice and another w/o sauce aka ""white"". Fiasco.  A family in front already had a beef going with the pizza boy  who didn't give a *?!% as to what was happening and treated them poorly. When we ordered  I thought  ""Now  why isn't this fool heating up the slices?"" as is the standard in every other pizza joint. The pies were petrified and might have been salvaged with a simple 2-min. reheat. But the jackass didn't care  and we were admittedly foolish not to demand it (sometimes we like to see what happens and then turn to the commentary and reviews for a proper lashing). So...here we are  kvetching about the god-awful-sorry-excuse-for-a-New York-pizza in a place called New York New York! Time to send in the mob to clean up the joint 'cause it's despicable. Next time  we'll opt for Nathan's or the deli next door. What a joke! Shame on you..."
Restaurants;Pizza,Went here for a slice 16 years ago during our first time in vegas. Went back last week and the pizza is as good as we remembered!  Only issue that I had really was the rudeness of the employees. Vegas is a consumer driven town. They want business they should be nicer to the consumers. They don't have to act as if they are truly in New York City!!
Restaurants;Pizza,This pizza joint absolutely sucks. The pizza was so plain and flavorless. I'd pay a dollar a slice at most. Don't waste your time here.
Restaurants;Pizza,One of the reasons I stay at NYNY is because of their variety of food. This stay I was disappointed. I love going to Sirricos but the last 2 times haven't been very good. They have 2 different types of pizza you can choose from  Sicilian which is the thicker type  or traditional New York which is large and thin. I went with the Sicilian. You walk up and choose what slice you want based on what they have prepared  if you want something different they tell you it's not available or to come back later. I chose a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. When I started eating  it was already starting to get cold. You could tell it had been sitting there for a while. I would recommend them heating it up in the oven for you to make it hot and crispy  of course they won't do that because the wait time will be to long. Anyways I will take my adventures to another pizza place next time I'm in town.
Restaurants;Pizza,Was in New york New York gambling and wanted a cheap dinner  so enter Sirrico's. They have about 10-12 different selections on pizza (with a slice costing about $5-$6 a piece). I tried their pepperoni and Pepperoni and Sausage New York Slices (Both were really really good) and their pepperoni sicilian slice (good  could use more sauce). Overall If your not looking to spend much and are in New York New York  give this place a try.
Restaurants;Pizza,Sirrico's was the perfect place for a pre-show snack before Zumanity.  For about six dollars I got a GIANT slice of Hawaiian pizza with perfect chewy crust.  May not be the best restaurant in Vegas  but if you're pressed for time and want a quick bite in the streets of New York  New York  it's an excellent choice.
Restaurants;Pizza,We paid $16 for the greasiest pizza ever.   My buddy who had one slice immediately took a giant  smelly dump in my room at NY NY.
Restaurants;Pizza,Best pizza I've had in Vegas. It's open late so great after a show or after drinks. Lots of variety to chose from. Not sure about the pies that sat since we had a slice from right out of the oven pies. Good flavor  even my Chicago man enjoyed a slice. Definitely worth a try.
Restaurants;Pizza,By far the worst pizza I have ever had. Adding that this is NYC style pizza is embarrassing. Burnt black crust and half cooked Sicilian slices. Barf.
Restaurants;Pizza,pertty good pizza thin crust. great late night food after drinking..we ate here 2 times while in vegas
Restaurants;Pizza,$6.00 for a slice of Mushroom pizza that tastes like tap water. The crust  the cheese  everything was so bland.   Customer service-wise  the lady at the counter was very nice  thus the 2 stars.   I've never had pizza from NY but I sure hope that this isn't what I would go all the way over there for.
Restaurants;Pizza,THE ORDER Pizza - What else  YIPPEEEE Disclaimer: I'm a Chicago girl myself                But this is the best New York Pizza in town They stay open till like 2am  BOOO NOTHING  A huge crunchy delicious slice of cheesy goodness                      what is their to bitch about
Restaurants;Pizza,This is so our spot for some late night grub after a long night of drinking and playing tables.  Pizza  pizza.  We had a pepperoni and the other cheese.  Yummo!  It's open until 3am  too.
Restaurants;Pizza,This pizza sucks. It's worse than high school  worse than the movie theatre  I get better pizza from Vons.   Take s bite the grease comes of it like sprinklers. Cheap ingredients  greasy  the crust is burnt and soggy.   And it's expensive as fuck.
Restaurants;Pizza,I used to come here all the time with a buddy of mine to chow down on pizza and lasagna. Now  I don't go out of my way for it so much.   This place used to be so good  man. Like  super good. They had amazing pizza  though the prices were high. Still  we'd come here every other weekend. We were regulars  and it was our opinion at the time that the pizza here could not be beat.   That was then. Now  it seems that their pizza is less awesome. I don't know whether that's because the quality has indeed dropped  or maybe it's because I've gotten used to it and now I expect amazing things from this this place. Their lasagna is still good  though I'm certain that it has dropped in quality from where it used to be.   Because the pizza here is more expensive  it's easy for you to spend $15 on a meal here. Not that it's not worth it  but it just seems kinda pricey. The cool thing is that it's inside the NYNY  so you can eat a ton and then kinda walk around for a little and do the tourist thing. That way you don't feel super bad about eating so much!
Restaurants;Pizza,Food is delicious and staff is very friendly. Both the Sicilian style and thin crust are very good. Also convenient because it's inside New York  New York!
Restaurants;Pizza,The lady behind the counter was a little rude.  There was no line and when I walked in no signs posted to order here?? Got to the cash register to order and has to go back to get my pizza.    Ordered the Sicilian pepperoni for John and the mushroom for myself.  Nothing like the pizza I remembered in NYC.  Pretty bland  and the crust was burnt.  It was a debate between the deli and pizza..should've gone with the deli.
Restaurants;Pizza,This was the best pizza I had while I was in Las Vegas! I actually found it by mistake while I was staying at the MGM across the street  but glad I found it.  I'm from New York  and I actually found their slices to be outstanding! And the ambience of where it is located within the casino can't be beat. You walk down a cobblestone alley and there it is. I'll definitely be back next time in town...
Restaurants;Pizza,"How could I resist when my manfriend calls and asks  ""Hungry?"" Without a single thought  I blurted  ""Yes!"" He says  ""Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!"" Uhm  there's that in this city? Am thinking  my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm  a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay  he picks me up and off we go. Initially  he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago  and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).  Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!  Like a ""starved"" woman  I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter  the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course  I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite  fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers  garlic  oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic  oh my! Then so  I got a hold of the oregano  hot red dried pepper  garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These  are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese.   Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em  this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions  olives  mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness  tasty tomato sauce  and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto  mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah  hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated  as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You  am talking to you! Go munch on a pizza yumm pizza!"
Restaurants;Pizza,Food poisoning on 10-15-2016.  Wife and I each had a slice of pizza and were vomiting an hour later.  Had to take an ambulance to the ER from our hotel.    Don't eat here.  Ever!!!
Restaurants;Pizza,"This was a great place to grab some good food and ""escape"" the craziness on the strip. When you're in New York New York you'll find yourself in a cartoony  cute version of New York complete with hot dog joints  pizza places and a nice looking Jewish Deli. Sirrico's was a perfect place to grab a quick dinner  we got a whole pizza for $22 that fed 5 people and left all of us satisfied as we made our way onto the town for a night of drinking.   It was hot  greasy  but not too greasy and the thin crust pizza you can fold in half while you're eating it- good stuff. If you want some tasty food to coat your tummy before going out Sirrico's would be a great place to start."
Restaurants;Pizza,Mrs. liked the layout of Greenwich Ave. She wanted to dine with the feeling of a street seating setup. So  we each got ourselves food from different restaurants. Ian wanted a pizza from this place. Total for the slice was $5.95.  Ordering is straightforward. You walk in  place your order  choose your drink  pay at the end of the counter  and carry away your plate of warm food.   Pros: Location  I guess. No Queue at this place compared to the other joints when we ordered.  Cons: Not good at all. One of the worst pizza's we ever saw/ate (-2) Portion was tiny (-1)
Restaurants;Pizza,Omg pepperoni jalapeno and mushrooms is the way to go!!! The mushrooms were fresh and the jalapenos were the perfect measure of spice. Definitely worth the walk. Super fun environment... Live music from the bar across the way. Available sitting to ppl watch and conversate. I will be coming back for more my next trip to Vegas
Restaurants;Pizza,In Vegas  it's hard to beat a slice and a Rolling Rock for $7  so I take the deals when I get em. Reminds me of a Sbarro's from back home. Slices could've used some seasoning...Garlic  salt  pepper...all needed to be added to the ZA. And how about throwing them in the oven for a quick reheat?! Plenty of choices pizza-wise  and a few Italian classics find the menu as well. Our gyro and pepperoni slice went down quick  not a whole lot of complaining. A little more effort and I think the place would welcome more repeat customers as opposed to the first time gamblers and stumblers. Late night... it's a helluva meal.
Restaurants;Pizza,A native NY'er here....pizza comes surprisingly NYC authentic. First slice made you want another.
Restaurants;Pizza,okay.. so we all say pizza from new york is amazing right?  Well this place is okay.  The slices are huge but the taste isn't there.  For some reason  I believe it's the crust  well at least for the thick crust pizzas.  The thin crust  it's a little better.  well that's my opinion at least  the boyfriend on the other hand likes it.  but what more do you want  your at new york new york and it's 2 am in the morning and they are the only place open around you.
Restaurants;Pizza,Can't say too much since i ordered the pie to go but this pizza is the bomb. The mushrooms really stood out since they were fresh but like any pizza the crust and the sauce are the main ingredients to judge on. Both were really good  not too soft and not too crunchy. This pizza was even good the next day cold!
Restaurants;Pizza,"Nice little pizza shop inside the Village Streets food court of sorts at the New York New York Hotel & Casino. They've good slices of Sicilian or New York style pizza already made and ready to be tossed on a plate.   Various choices of toppings are available  though the pepperoni & sausage rock!   There's also garlic bread  garlic twists  and pizza lasagna  but what I liked best was that they were open late when you've got the cruising munchies going on and there's the slice of pizza and a Busch lite beer special for $5.75.   Can't really want for more at that time.  And there's usually seats to be found at nearby ""street"" tables  which if you are lucky  will afford you a view of the action going on across the ""street"" at Bar At Times Square.  I went here 3 times at least in a couple of days and the only thing that stops 5 stars here is that the service is slow  with one taking care of the orders  one person at the register down at the end  and the rest of the crew are making pizzas.  This can get a line of people stacking up really quick  and then the guy taking the orders seems to get lost in figuring out who's next in line."
Restaurants;Pizza,It's $5.95 for the biggest/greasiest single slice of pepperoni pizza  but hey when I wanted an easy lunch before the pool - it worked! I managed to eat the whole dang piece lol. They have a $7.00/deal for a slice and a rolling rock!   If we stay at NYNY again I would probably get more pizza here  lol! Convenience!
Restaurants;Pizza,Pretty impressive flavor for fast food. It's the bread throughout the hotel. Skip the little salads and the thicker slices
Restaurants;Pizza,Grabbed a slice of pepperoni and mushroom pizza late one night on our way back up to our room at New York  New York Hotel. I was really hungry  and this hit the spot! It was tasty  chewy  greasy  cheesy and big! And it came with a cold beer!
Restaurants;Pizza,Worst pizza ever. Sausage was sliced type not real Italian sausage. Crust was soggy and service was awful. Would never come here again. Expect more from. A place that is supposed to be real NY style pizza. Stay away
Restaurants;Pizza,Popped in for a slice of pizza on the way up to the room after a day of meetings (and NOT drinking unfortunately).  Was taken back by the $10.22 charge for a single slice of pizza but didn't say anything because everything in Vegas is costly and the girl at the counter wouldn't even make eye contact.  Looking through my receipts to fill out expenses I see I was charged $3.50 for a large soda that I didn't order or receive.  Guessing this is just a way to take advantage of people and rip them off even more.  Not impressed Sirrico's!
Restaurants;Pizza,This is a review by a vegetarian  The Sicilian (plain) is doughy  bland  and overpriced at about $4 for a big slice. I thought casinos just looked to break even on food.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is probably my favorite pizza in Vegas. Every time I come visit this city I make It a point to visit this shop.   The Sicilian pizza is nice with a great thick crust  but the pizza is also greasy enough to fold when you pick it up. They serve several types of pizza in both traditional NY style as well as the Sicilian.   I also love the atmosphere of this place. The inside of the hotel/casino looks like you are on the streets of NYC! It makes you feel that you really are in NYC getting a slice from the corner shop. The streets inside are also labeled just as you see in the city.   I would recommend this place for a quick snack as you are gambling  or after a long night of drinking. They are open until 4am on some nights! They also serve beer that you can have with your slice. I call that a win-win!
Restaurants;Pizza,My boyfriend and I stayed at the New York New York hotel for about a week. We ordered room service one night and had decided on a cheese and pepperoni pizza! I honestly wasn't expecting much  but I was so wrong! We absolutely loved our pizza! And we love to try new things and especially pizza! It's honestly one of the best  fresh tasting  and new York style pizzas we've ever had! The dough was light and thin and crunchy. With the most simple  robust and fresh tomatoe sauce topped with creamy mozzarella! With the best spicy pepperoni ever! It was was a huge pizza with huge slices!! Just like new york! We even ate it cold! Great pizza! If you have palet for fresh  original and quality pizza....this is the place to stop by! Even if I didn't stay at New York New York  I would drive the extra mile to come here to get a good pizza! So worth it. Simple and delicious!
Restaurants;Pizza,We order A large peperoni there are 3 ready to go. They make us wait 25 minutes for one I don't understand this place will not put the costumer first. It's a workforce full of basic ass bitches
Restaurants;Pizza,"$5 for a slice of cold ""NY"" pizza? this new yorker thinks not."
Restaurants;Pizza,This pizza was okay  the sauce is good and so is the dough  but they skimped on the cheese. I recommend adding oregano and use the Parmesan that they offer. Adding that really makes it tastier. For the money  you can go to NY pizza on the other end of the strip and get a better pizza for less money.
Restaurants;Pizza,We ordered a whole pie  and at $28 considered it a bargain to feed five people in Vegas.  The line was relatively short when we arrived and upon placing the order  was told that it would be ready in 25 minutes.  They do not serve you at this place and after the 25 minute wait  it was back in line (which was much longer at this point) to pick up the pizza.  We opened up the box and right away noticed the terrible cutting job on the pie.  The pizza itself is very thin and the crappy cutting job made it impossible to pick up a whole slice of pizza.  The toppings and cheese were sliding off and it was just a huge mess.  We literally had to use forks to scoop the toppings back on our broken slices of pizza.    As far as taste goes  it was good.  Nothing spectacular but better than your average pizza joint.  This place was one of the best bargains in Vegas as it was inexpensive food that filled us up for the night.
Restaurants;Pizza,Preceding our visit to Zumanity  we snagged a few slices from Sirrico's. The food was slightly overpriced  but decent tasting. I had a Sicilian and a NY style slice. The slices were good  but mediocre pizza overall.  If we're pressed for time and hungry  Sirrico's may be a place to go. I won't go out of my way to go there  and won't be craving their pizza either.
Restaurants;Pizza,As soon as I get off the plane I go straight here for a pizza slice. Best pizza slice ever. When I'm not in Vegas I dream about going back just for the pizza.
Restaurants;Pizza,If looking for a quick bite in New York New York  this place will definitely fill you up. Big  heavy slices  loads of cheese. Definitely better than chain pizza joints.
Restaurants;Pizza,We ordered a $30 pie for take out with jalapenos  green peppers  and black olives. Very spicy - I enjoyed but definitely do not order the jalapenos if your heat tolerance isn't high.   The wait time was 20-25 minutes  just as the server had advised. Great service - we were given plates  chilli flakes  and parmesan to take back with us.
Restaurants;Pizza,"Hhm  from what I remember about my two slices  it was ""the best pizza I ever had!!"" (Just kidding  judgement becomes impaired when under the influence) But overall  I enjoyed the fresh and hot slices right out of the oven. Inexpensive for a quality slice and soda!"
Restaurants;Pizza,Visited May 1  2015. The mushroom pizza was amazing! And getting the beer & pizza special  under $8 is a plus after an exciting night in Las Vegas! Great people working there  they were very friendly!
Restaurants;Pizza,Don't care that it's overpriced because it's on the strip so that's expected. But this was the worst pizza I have had in my life  and I am not a critical person prone to giving one star reviews. I got a 'traditional' vegetarian pie. There was barely any cheese or tomato sauce on it. It was undercooked and doughy  bland  tasteless  and didn't even have enough salt on it. The crust was way too wide due to them not putting much tomato sauce or cheese on it. The vegetarian topping is diced green  yellow and red bell peppers and onions  which I knew beforehand  but which seemed to have put straight from a bag of frozen diced bell peppers and onions onto the pizza prior to underbaking it. Thankfully they gave us some little containers of dry Parmesan and crushed red pepper which helped make it at least edible. I never eat just one slice of pizza but one slice was more than enough. The four other people with me agreed that the pizza was bland and undercooked. We went here at 9 pm today which is not late for them as they were going to be open till 3 am or something according to their sign. I can't believe this restaurant has 3 1/2 stars on yelp. Maybe we just got one of the worst pizzas they have ever made and it was a fluke  but I'm never going back there to find out.
Restaurants;Pizza,One of my favorite place to eat. I have been here many times and their gross is always delicious. Must have for any pizza fan!
Restaurants;Pizza,An awesome bite after watching Zumanity!  We saw the 10pm showing and by the time we got out we were starving!  It was really nice to see that this place was open.  Maybe it was because we were really hungry...but that slice of pizza was awesome!  A little over-priced--around $4+ for a slice...realized we should've just bought the whole pizza for $20.    Great little bite of NY style pizza at the NYNY Hotel :)
Restaurants;Pizza,"First thought was ""wow this's Pretty DAMB good pizza.........."" I would've gave it 5 stars but the  problem was that they need to run it thru the oven before handing it off................................................................. Got a couple cold pieces this weekend and it went from great to mediocre."
Restaurants;Pizza,We went here for a 2am drunken snack. People were pissed that they were out of pizza but we waited a few minutes for a slice of vegetarian that was coming out (beggars can't be choosers right?) the pizza was really good and the guy waiting on people had a great attitude even though people were being rude. Would be nice if they had more pizza rolling out since it does say 24 hours on the sign.
Restaurants;Pizza,A good affordable alternative inside the New York New York Casino. The service is pretty fast and the pizza slices are enormous. I would come back for sure...
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is in a casino for a reason. It's a real gamble if you get a good slice.  A whole pie-fresh out of the oven is ok. But the slice are either doughy as hell or dried out and crisy.  Huge slices but what does it matter if it's no good. I'd say pass & go off the strip for some real NY pizza.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is one of the number one reasons I stay at NYNY! I love pizza at 3am after a night out in Vegas!  Pizza is really good! It's so hard to decide sometimes which pizza to get! My favorite is the cheese pizza!
Restaurants;Pizza,Hands down  best pizza on the Las Vegas strip  no doubt about it. I would walk the entire strip from end to end just to eat this pizza. I can't even choose between Sicilian style or thin-sliced so I just get them both!
Restaurants;Pizza,I've stayed at the NYNY casino a few times and have grabbed a quick slice here on more than one ocassion. Last time  we ordered an entire pie. It took about 20 minutes and was pretty greasy  but was exactly what we were looking for.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is one of two pizza places located inside the New York New York Hotel. I tried both of them being that I'm a huge New York style pizza fan. I would say that Sirrico's is the best one.  The slices were very big. I went with just cheese slices. The sauce was good  and the crust was to as well. Stays open really late  so after a night of hanging out (or winning some money at the casino) walk over there and enjoy a slice.
Restaurants;Pizza,"I was in the same Co. as Kate S  previous. Although  I decided to skip the greasy pizza and get... wait for it... a greasy meatball sandveech! ""Meatball Hero"" I believe it was called... Not bad. The meatballs were nothing special. Gradually losing my appetite  I just dumped those and ate the cheesy & saucy bread."
Restaurants;Pizza,I have stopped here on both trips to Vegas and thoroughly enjoyed my slice of cheese pizza each time. Perhaps around $5 is a bit pricy for a slice of cheese pizza  but I still thought it was damn good and crust perfect. Despite long lines  they were very quick  too.
Restaurants;Pizza,All due respect to Janelle N. from Santa Monica  but you need to look harder in LA for a better pizza place. I'm from the same metro as you and I can name at least 10 places that are heads and shoulders better than this. In fact  this isn't even very good pizza  not for the price anyway. If it cost $2 a slice I'd say it was perfect  but since it's almost $5 a slice  gah! It better be something special.  This is not something special. It's your typical Pizza made NY style and the ingredients didn't seem like anything I wouldn't get from your low grade pizza joint. I'd never  ever go back here because the cost of the pizza just was not remotely worth the slice they gave me  which had also clearly been sitting out longer then I'd of liked as well.  I've tried pizza in Los Angeles as well  I also tried it in Chicago  in Alberqueque  in Minneapolis  in Milwaukee  but mark my words the Vegas pizza I ate here was by far the worst  and surprise surprise  also the most costly.  This place your typical average 3 star pizza  but because of the price it drops to a 2. Don't believe ANYONE who says this is anything other then average. Some people just don't explore far enough past Vegas to know.
Restaurants;Pizza,I remember liking this place a lot as a kid. I still reminisce the thought of running up to our hotel room with a large pizza  steam blowing into my face as I opened the box. It's not quite the same as an adult. So less exciting. So less glamorous. You are either here after a late night of drinking or looking for a cheap bite to appease hunger or looking for an unfilling dinner after a lunch of buffet gorging. Mind you  it's not even cheap at about $4.50 a slice for pepperoni or sausage or both or both with jalapeno. The veggie's even more for once at $5. I would recommend a whole pie. That one is way reasonable. There's even a thick Sicilian style if floppy New York style is not your thing. Sometimes  there's a long line. Sometimes  it's worth it. Sometimes  it's not.
Restaurants;Pizza,A slice of pizza is approximately 5.95 which includes tax. So I had two slices of pizza throughout the day: pepperoni with jalapeno and pepperoni with mushroom. Well  the pepperoni with jalapeno was okay. The trick is to ask for them to reheat the slices as they probably have been sitting out for a while for public display. I would imagine that the slice of pizza would have been better warmer. So later on after a long night of partying  I decided to grab another slice to soak up that alcohol. This time  I remembered to heat it up and it tasted fantastic. They were quite accommodating to putting that slice in a box for me even though they had ran out of smaller boxes.
Restaurants;Pizza,"My guy loves the pizza here so we made a stop about 2 hours after our early dinner or late lunch at BLT.  Since I was all dressed up and was afraid to gain massive amounts of weight in a short period of time and because it was sweet of him to buy me the burger at BLT  I treated him to a slice but he made me take a few bites of the pizza and continued to roll his eyes and scoff when I would hesitate to eat.    It is a good pizza.. very saucy (I always order my pizza w/ extra sauce)  the pizza is thin but was a little bit doughy at the end  and our peperoni and jalapenos were evenly distributed.  It is ""our"" thing to add jalapenos (if not bacon as well) to our pizzas... I don't know why there wasn't bacon on this thing  haha.  He could have ordered bacon w/ a side of bacon (haha).    Sitting outside  there was music blaring from afar  people from all walks of life trekking back and forth  and the best thing that I saw whilst enjoying my snack at New York-New York were the slabs of dry-aged beef (steaks) featured at Gallagher's.  Did you know that Gallagher's is the only place in New York City to grill their steaks over hickory coals?  Now you do!"
Restaurants;Pizza,Home of the no cheese on your pizza  30.00 for a large cracker with no sauce no cheese terrible  Waste of money  Not what im used to for a ny pizza  This is in new york new york casino  Las vegas nevada
Restaurants;Pizza,Great Service and food! Split a slice of pizza and a beer for $7.77. We walked from Treasure Island along the strip in and out of casinos along the way to New York New York specifically for a slice of pizza and definitely worth it!
Restaurants;Pizza,Ok prices for a quick lunch/snack. The sicilian seems to have spicier sauce than the traditional. Free wifi in the 'streets'.
Restaurants;Pizza,"I remember being 11 or 12 years old and staying at New York New York with my family and having pizza in the ""New York streets"". That memory is forever engraved in my mind. A decade+ later and I still find myself coming to New York New York and getting a slice at Sirrico's.  I try me best at visiting Sirrico's whenever I'm in town. I'll admit it's not the best pizza in Vegas  but I love it for some reason. I guess it does help that it's open until 3 or 4AM. The slices are a little pricey ($5-6) but are generous in size. I typically get a traditional slice and a Sicilian slice. Add a soft-drink and you're looking at about $12.  The pizza itself depends on how long it's been sitting under the heat lamp. I typically wait for fresh pies to come out and never fail to be tasty. The crust is especially good  most notable on the Sicilian style  which is extra thick. The gooey cheese  thick crust  and pizza sauce all add up for some tasty NY pizza. I'm sure Sirrico's is years away from authentic NY style pizza  but it's Vegas after all.  Ambiance: 3 Stars (out of 5) Food: 3 Stars (out of 5) Service: N/A Price: $ Overall: 3 Stars (out of 5)  Pros: + New York and Sicilian style slices + Extra thick crust on Sicilian style + Slices or whole pies + Reasonably priced + Open late  Cons: - Quality and taste can vary"
Restaurants;Pizza,Been here a few times. Not to fond of the pizza here. It's pretty greasy. You get a nice big slice though. I tried the pasta. Not that great. Only had a few bites and threw it sway. The cheese in the lasagna tasted old  like  re-heated leftovers. The garlic bread was hard. It was obviously sitting there awhile. They overcharged us. The customer service however was good. Very friendly. Some people didn't know anything about the food though. Was a little annoying having to keep waiting for him to ask someone else and report back to me. Salads are good. Beer is good.
Restaurants;Pizza,The funny thing is that this pizza is good  but the flavor only okay.  It isn't greasy so that's one redeeming quality. The sauce isn't sweet like fresh tomato sauce. It's okay because I have tasted better the first time.
Restaurants;Pizza,It was about 12 am and my family and I were craving pizza. We were walking around for about 20 minutes looking for a place that was both promising and open haha a task which was harder than we thought!!   We came across this place on the first floor of New York New York and decided to give it a go. A slice was about $6 and a whole pie was $25  so we decided to just order a whole pizza  cause it just would have been a couple dollars more.   The pizza was humongous!! Very crispy and worth the 15 minutes wait!   My only complaint is that the staff looked as if they hated their lives. They gave me a look when I ordered a whole pizza cause it meant that they had to turn around  distribute pepperoni on a cheese pizza  and bake it for a couple minutes. That rubbed me the wrong way  because I was in a happy mood and excited to devour some pizza. Put a damper on my mood. Plus I'm really big on customer service.    However  the product was great and hit the spot. Would eat this pizza again hundreds of times more!
Restaurants;Pizza,Overall its a pretty good Pizza place. I usually end up coming here once on my visits to Vegas. This time was no different. The pizzas average and the price isn't bad if you want a quick bite to eat to beat down the hunger before hitting the next bar. I think the cool thing about this place is the pizzeria over looks the NY NY casino floor. Its a far stretch from eating real NY pizza in NY  but you kinda get that feeling when combined with the decor in the food area. It looks like the small shops/restaurants and streets of NY scaled down. Pizza is average  but it definitely gets an extra point for the view.
Restaurants;Pizza,This place is located inside New York New York and has some great pizza. We came for lunch and late night snack.   The pepperoni pizza is soo good and greasy... And this place is open until 4am btw so set your alarm for 345 do you can run over from the club.
Restaurants;Pizza,Mediocre pizza.  Unfortunately  mine was cold by the time I got to the front of the line.
Restaurants;Pizza,This is the best place for pizza in Las Vegas.  Hands down.  I make sure to head there at least once while I am in Las Vegas.  The pizza is so good.  They must be putting cocaine in it or something.  The prices are a little high  but it's in a Las Vegas casino  not the dollar menu at McDonald's.  I highly recommend you go there  even if you are staying in the Stratosphere dump and have to shelp your way on the crowded stinky bus down Las Vegas Boulevard.  Do it.
Restaurants;Pizza,Good pasta dishes  but the garlic bread is extremely greasy. Service was good  didn't have to wait long at all. Not bad at all especially if you are hungover. Its right next to the piano bar so you have a little entertainment after you get your meal. It is worth checking out if you are looking for quick  cheap Italian.
Restaurants;Pizza,I've had worse pizza  but not much. And the way they have the line set up  your slice is cold by the time you finish paying. On the positive side  they do offer a fresh fruit cup for a healthy dessert.
Restaurants;Pizza,Under rated!!! Thee stars really?  So better then secret pizza at thee cosmo.
Restaurants;Pizza,We were craving pizza and it was in the hotel we were gambling at. I got the cheese and hubby got the square cheese. It was good and my only complaint is I wish the pizza was warmed up longer. I like mine extra hot and crispy on the bottom.
Restaurants;Pizza,Pricey but very good pizza for Vegas. The Sicilian is the way to go. Slices are very filling. No free refils on soda  $3 first   $1.62 per refill.
Restaurants;Pizza,"Who doesn't love grabbing a slice of greasy new York style pizza after a long night of gambling and drinking?! I do! I just recently stayed overnight at the New York New York Hotel and Casino just this past week and stumbled across this place. Now even though I shouldn't be eating pizza at 2AM who cares I already messed that whole diet thing up after consuming the empty calories in the liquor that night hehe. Pizza was on my mind until I actually walked inside the place and saw how delicious the lasagna was looking. One of the employee's was super friendly and kind enough to encourage me to get this dish over the pizza because it was ""more fresh"" which aka he in code let me know the pizza wasn't as good. Thanks bro! I will have to re-visit this place when they have a fresh slice of pizza available then! They are open until 3AM during the weekdays so if you find yourself wandering around the strip in the area or staying inside the hotel stop by!"
Restaurants;Pizza,Sirricos is my kind of pizza joint!  It doesn't get much better than enjoying a hot slice of pizza and a cold beer while watching drunk fools stumble out of Gonzalez y Gonzalez club at 1:00 am.  The pizza here is obviosly New York style  since it is located inside of New York New York Casino.  The crust and cheese are thin  and the toppings are neat and organized.  The sausage they use is thinly sliced Italian sausage placed directly onto the pizza (none of that ground meat looking stuff here).  They usually have a $6.99 for a slice of pizza and a Busch light deal going  which is an awesome deal considering that's what you pay for just the beer at most bars.  This is the perfect place to go when you feel like chilling and eating after a long night on the strip.  As good as it gets in my book!
Restaurants;Pizza,$12 for 2 slices is a little steep even for Vegas but it was 3am and we were hungry.  With that being said the pizza is real NY pizza and that's coming from a real New Yorker.  I prefer real thin slices u need to fold up to eat.  It was good.
Restaurants;Pizza,This was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.  I ordered the mushroom pizza which came with maybe 5 to 10 pieces on a 2 inch thick piece of bread.  Sooooo not worth the wait or the cost.  If it wasn't for the fact that I was starving  I wouldn't have even eaten the half I did eat.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,DO NOT LIVE HERE... This place is garbage. I've lived her for 2 weeks and I wish I never signed a lease...  YOUVE BEEN WARNED
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,The only reason that they got 1 star out of me is because yelp starts at 1 star or cobblestone creek would have received 1/2 star.  The managment couldn't be worse (rude)  the repairs are slow & done improperly. The apts have horrible floor plans  there is NO way that these are the sq footage that they list. The hallways reek of weed & cigarette smoke  As if managment cant smell any weed smell as they walk by. The carpets are extremly cheap & pile in just a few months  the cupboard drawers fall apart  we had mold issues because we asked them to fix something that they tore apart but then they said they didnt get the repair request. Or they say  ok  I'll be right back after they look at it but then never do return. Our dishwasher would fall open when we tried loading it & smash my hands because it wasn't braced in properly after our other one broke. It only took them 2 weeks to get us a new one! The fridge was falling apart  didnt go past cool  the freezer didn't work. We couldn't even use the door shelves because the things that help hold the food on the shelves were broke! It only took 3 requests to get a newer one. I'll admit the new fridge was nice but they banged up our kitchen  dented the dishwasher & the wall. It did not fit properly poking forward too much because it was too big for the spot & took up more space in our already teeny tiny kitchen. Oh & let's not forget the cupboards that are made for 7ft people. I bought a step stool & still could only reach the front of the 2nd cupboard shelf. My husband is 6ft & needed the step stool to get to the top cupboard shelves. Who ever hung these cupboards was an idiot! They are hung 12 inches higher then normal cupboards  if you are shorter than 6ft don't plan on getting much use out of these cupboards.Chances are your appliance colors wont match either. They showed my husband 1 apt but then when he went to move in it wasnt ready since he had a uhaul & his father came to help move him (I came into his life after he moved in) he was forced to take a different apt than he had said ok to. The Blinds fall apart constanly & warp from the suns heat. The apts are poorly insulated & get very hot in the summer.   They charge you a nonrefundable cleaning deposit (which is fine) however when you go to move out after a couple years & the apt needs to by law be repainted between tenants they charge YOU $250 for it! It didnt even need painted but it is required by law. They charge you for new carpet when it is clearly cheap & started to wear out within months of move in thru the traffic areas  front door & hall area. They tried charging us over $1 000 for stuff. They charged us for thier cheap blinds because the viens were broken & when we requested that they replace them while we lived there they did not take care of this but then added them to our bill! Had I known they were going to pull this crap I wouldnt have even cleaned the carpets! That apt was so clean that other than the cheap drawers  not repairing what THEY needed to repair & investing in better quality carpeting it could have been moved into by the next tenants.Beware of moving out!  The hallways are loud & often not clean  the laundry rooms are horrible with washers that fits about 1/2 load but they charge $1.25 for  they dont even get the clothes clean! These are run down  I have seen older apts in much better condition. They were cheap to live in at first  then they raise the rent $110. $110 more for a crappy apt in a bad neighborhood? It was close to my husbands work (he moved into cobblestone creek before we had met)   We are out of that area & those apts (thank God) We are in the Green Valley area in our own house with our own pool & jacuzzi & a backyard & an actual garage. No moer apt living for us. I will say this though... After living in such a dump owning your own house in a really nice neighborhood is Heaven!   Cobblestone Creek is a DUMP  beware of living there... We made that mistake  hope you dont make the same mistake!
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,To the Yelp followers & Reviewers          I have lived at 4200 paradise AKA. Cobblestone creek formerly  since January 2000 and I have great neighbors  I love my neighbors they're awesome folks the manager June K. & Brenda they are awesome at their jobs they really care about the people  about you personally & they really do a good job managing  the community.  The pros:         Location location location  you can walk to the strip 15 min. maintenance is quick to reply  Great Security co.  & beautiful landscaping  almost all the office folks have good attitudes.   The cons: traffic  & the walls are a bit thin.        I have to say if you give them time to respond they usually do what's right and make the customer happy.       Sincerely      Peter Alderson
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,I want to say nice things about this place but there is NO EXCUSE why I should have had to pay rent when I could not even take a comfortable shower. They gave me excuses about how the hot water was uncontrollable and kept trying to imply it was my own fault that I couldn't get the temperature right. They were difficult and rude at times and lied on several occasions. The arms did go off a lot and there was a leaf blower early int he morning all the time to wake me up. When I moved in  they gave me an apartment with a lot of really bad carpet stains which pissed me off. They claimed they would correct it and never would. Also  the tub was nasty and needed to be resurfaced which they promised and never did. When you leave  they tack on  A LOT of fees.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,O ya Paradise baby!  We moved into Paradise Apartments in July. wow it's clean  well kept grounds n pools  friendly staff and security and so far whisper quiet.  Just our little corner of paradise.  Thank you we love it.  Great job staff. A great view and right down the street from REVOLT TATTOOS.  Thanks also for the smooth move in.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,I rented a 2nd story apt for 8 months. The complex is old for Vegas & not in the safest part of town. I moved here purely because of cheap rent & close proximity to the strip & UNLV while I was saving money & studying.  My main complaints are: (1) even though I changed out the vent every month my apt & thus everything in it  always reeked of cigarette smoke even though I don't smoke; (2) people who came to visit me complained the apt & complex smelled strongly of smoke  chemicals & dust; the rent increase- after my lease was up they raised my rent from $445 to $675.  $445 was a fair price for what the apt is- older  kind of run down & smelling of smoke. I felt any rent increase more than something nominal was unreasonable considering the complex & that I had been quiet  clean & always paid my rent early. I talked to neighbors who experienced the same high rent hikes. The pros: walking distance to hardrock  double down  UNLV  etc; the maintenence crew are extremely nice & helpful; jacuzzi that remains open 24/7.  I'd say if you need somewhere cheap & close to the strip this is a good temporary option- just go for a longer lease if you plan on staying for a while to avoid a rent hike. I'm actually greatful they hiked my rent  now- It pushed me to get out & find a better living situation-- I'm now paying a $675 mortgage (including HOA) on a gorgeous large new southwest home & I appreciate it big time! Lily who works in the office is an absolute sweetheart- very helpful & nice- I recommend you ask for her when renting- she's the best! I hope this review doesn't offend anyone at Cobblestone- it's just my honest opinion based on what I experienced.  Hope it helps!
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,I am SO glad my lease will be over in June. 6 more months of homeless people digging through our trash  our mail room smelling like pet urine  fire alarms going off ALL the time  cheap cabinets falling apart  never getting enough hot water  and so on. I thought this would be a great place to live in because it is so close to everything but I've decided that taking the extra 15 minutes to get to school or to the strip is worth it to having a better place to live in.   Also  apparently these apartments are getting gated so the rent is going up significantly. I'm sorry  but for the quality of these apartments  the amount of fuss there is because of the fire alarms going off  and really rude management  it's not worth any more of my money.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,In parting i have one good thing to say.  Brenda in the office is a doll.  Con am should get rid of clarissa in the corporate office and promote Brenda to her position.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,Years later I have moved apartments within the complex and tried to make this place work.. but it just does not get better. Location has kept me here  but the rent keeps rising and t he quality of the situation degrades daily. As many others have said  the fire alarms go off all the time  and as I sit here writing this they are going off again.. for the 4th or 5th time in the last couple of months. It sometimes happens very late at night or very early in the morning.   You cannot trust what the women in the office say they will follow through and do  if you have any issues. The laundry facilities require you to add funds to a pay-card of sorts and the machines regularly malfunction  eat your money or just plain don't work. When you file a complaint with literally 3 different staff and call the number they say you have to go through.. nothing is fixed. They all pass blame around and the company that is meant to furnish your refunds for the cards  will tell you that they cannot do anything without hearing from the office. The office will tell you it's not their responsibility to deal with the laundry situation. Thus  nothing gets resolved and i'm currently out $36 for laundry. Although  you must understand that you cannot do laundry any other way  but to use these pay cards. (Unless you drive off-property)  There is SO MUCH noise at all hours. If it isn't the neighbors and children running up and down the hallways.. yes that includes full grown humans as well as kids..  it's an unnecessary leaf blower guy around 830 am. For what reason that needs to happen so often or that early is a mystery. When you ask Brenda or any of the other women in the office.. they say they have no control over the maintenance and yard workers. What do you all have control of??  A few months ago they started major hallway destruction in order to add new wiring for security cameras. When they did that.. they unleashed so many bugs and roaches. I never had any bugs in my apartment until that happened. The doors are not sealed properly and air  and dust.. and BUGS can just crawl underneath the doorway as a result. They gave ZERO notice for the construction and it lasted over a month and would begin as early as 6 am.. directly in front of my door. When I complained  I was told it was basically too bad and that it had to happen.   To top it all off  my car was stolen last year from my parking space at the complex. As f it weren't a bad enough situation  my car got stolen out from where I live. I'm locked into this lease for a few more months and I cannot barely afford to live here as I got laid off recently  though I have to find a way to get out.   ***The alarm has gone off and stopped and gone off again  FOUR TIMES as I sit here and write this for the last few minutes. It's ridiculous. Spend a little more money and stay somewhere else.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,STAY AWAY! BLACKMAIL! ALL FRONT OFFICE EMPLOYEES ARE LIARS! Please ignore my previous 3 star rating! The front office threatened to continue to charge me rent after I moved out at the end of my lease unless I changed my yelp rating. That is the sketchiest thing I have ever encountered from a business before. The front office blackmails its residents! This establishment is literally the worst! PLEASE READ ALL MY PREVIOUS REVIEWS ON WHAT LIVING HERE IS ACTUALLY LIKE!!! I'm changing my rating back to a 1 star now because I've payed all the extra hidden fees they  transferred to debt collectors upon moving out. Just a heads up  when you move out of this place you will get lots of calls from debt collectors for trivial amounts ($20-$35) This establishment should be shut down!  And even after I moved out they still charged me 1 extra months rent  so I had to notify my bank that I no longer lived there and that my lease was up and to cancel all further transactions from this company. DO NOT LIVE HERE! Literally live anywhere else!!! I wish I did... please don't make the same mistake I did. I know it looks nice on a first impression  but this place is the absolute worst. Don't trust anything the front office tells you. Trust reviews of people who have lived here.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,My name is Tony a resident at 4200 paradise I would like to congratulate the office team maintenance team and security team for making this a wonderful place to live again it is secure and safe and they did a wonderful job taking out the riff raff and making it a safe place to live good job thank you for listening
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,"I'm going to try to be as diplomatic as I can but I've been gone from this place for almost two months and my previous reviews are being harassed with private messages  plus I've had time to think with a clear mind but just having to do that makes me realize how bad it was. I barely scratched the surface with the plethora of problems I encountered while living here in my previous reviews. From the smallest details all the way to thefts  vandalism  negligence to handle issues the management is legally liable for  and downright argumentative staff ranging from the angry maintenance workers all the way to the corporate level. I felt like I was living back in the bad part of long beach just without the beach nearby or the people I know there. Although it may be entertaining to read the problems I've had while living here because there were plenty of them and they were becoming so bizarre that I couldn't even go home without my stress levels to skyrocket  I will refrain from writing as much as I can. There were some people living here that I thought were nice and there was one girl in the office that was most of the time very good to me  Christina  but unfortunately  the issues in general were becoming more serious then something a smile could sooth. She must've been doing good  though  because every other office member disappeared while I was living here except for her. But  the corporate staff (the ones employing her) knew me just from my voice when I called because they were becoming my goto for handling more serious issues  except  they were no better then the other bad staff. It seemed like their frame of mind was that it wasn't their job  it was the on-site staffs job so they didn't want to be bothered. Maybe true but one little detail missing was the actual problem that I was calling about in the first place was never handled because the on-site staff would never do anything.  The corporate staff seemed to start a protocol for dealing with my calls that would basically try to get me to describe the problem and once I did  they would tell me that it was the on-site management's problem to deal with. The calls would always end with me telling them that I know but I wouldn't be calling corporate if it was handled correctly in the first place. For something serious like having my i.d. and passport stolen from my place  my car being vandalised with malicious intent  their own security guard threatening me with violence at my front door all because of a misunderstanding on his part  my mailbox being broken into constantly from the lack of security  one of the maintenance that couldn't speak English very well trying to joke with me about doing his work because it was near my door....for weeks  the gardeners that also damaged my car while cleaning up scraps in the lot  and even their own maintenance staff threatening me after calling him when the trinity security company gave me his number by accident  that those things shouldn't take a month for the on-site manager to get back to me on...and that's just some of the things near the end of my tenancy here. These issues don't even touch the other issues that are probably more common like the top floor unit I lived in which seemed to have a very outdated air conditioning unit which made it near impossible to sleep in my room. I'm not even exaggerating when I tell you my entire room would shake like a small California earthquake every single night when the contraption would either shut off or start up. I even tried sleeping in the living room and that worked for awhile until a neighbor moved in that sounded like he tortured his dog and would leave it there by itself for extended periods of time causing it to jump up against the door and cry which would also somehow cause the apartment to shake from the impact of it's bashing against the large front doors. My neighbors across the hall must've been making porn movies because they were also so loud and they could never hear the dog.  So many building code violations like the mail room not being properly secured including the access door to the box itself. The elevators that would trap people inside and were never clean in spite of cleaning girls that would spray stuff inside but for months there was dried phlegm near the buttons in one. The laundry rooms that were always getting broken into from random people that I've even caught myself trying to take peoples clothes out of.  But  somehow  the owner has money to remodel the front of the building...which took an extremely long time for the workers to complete. Needless to say  the trauma from living here will no doubt be long lasting. It's a cross between living in the slums with a 'stuck in a prison' type feeling to being the convenient place for homeless or drug dealers or prostitutes or drunk people walking from the strip to crash at.  I don't know how the address isn't ""5150 Nowhere Near Paradise Road  Street Prison  NV"""
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,"10 things that come to my mind when I think of our experience here so far.  (1)The day we were supposed to move in  the toilet  air conditioning  garbage disposal and stove did not work.  The employee giving us a tour sent out a message on her walkies and then told us ""I didn't say everything that was wrong because my manager would have been upset. ""  You can imagine how upset I was!  Nothing was ever done to make this right.   (2)In the months to come  both of our sinks leaked and ruined things stored in the cabinets below them.  (3)The dishwasher also overflowed into the kitchen.   (4) Our toilet after being ""fixed"" overflowed into the carpeted hallway.  The repairman after trudging around in the mess then walked back through our apartment with literal poop residue on his shoes to go get ""tools"" that I guess he forgot to bring when we called that our toilet over flooded!  No one ever had the carpets replaced  or even cleaned.   (5)Our neighbors to our left smoke pot  and the people below us like to play bass all night long  and if we're lucky  they have drummer join in!   (6)Smoke constantly comes through the vent in the bathroom (that has no window).  I am forced to breathe it in and let it smell up my clothes  towels and apartment.   (7)Parking is a mess  and there are no washer and dryer hookups in the apartment unit.   (8)There are laundry facilities that are always full and overpriced.  In addition  you have purchase a special ""laundry card"" of course for a fee  that can than be loaded with money rather than just inserting money into the machines.   (9)Painting and construction is constantly going on to the outside of the building which is noisy and smelly  while the inside of the complex remains outdated and on the verge of collapsing.   (10)Finally  my husband (who always pays rent and bills) was out of town and unable to communicate with me  long story short he had no way to pay the rent and I had no idea.  When I asked if the fee could be waived because we have never been late on any bill before  they replied that they could not because they treat everyone equal.  They do treat everyone equal  equally horrible.  This place is very overpriced for the sub par quality of living.  There is no customer service; it's just a cruel business.  I recommend renting elsewhere and being treated like a human being  a paying tenant  rather than just a walking dollar sign."
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,Since moving to Vegas in 05 I have lived in everything from rented houses to luxury apartments.  They were all shit.  If it wasn't the management  it was the neighbors or the neighborhood.  I just want to be left alone and to my own devices.  These apartments are awesomely priced  it has all the shit you need and would expect (service  clean grounds  safe surroundings  laundry facilities that are well maintained  a gym with the things you need from a gym). The location  come on man! everything you need is in walking distance! They're not the newest or the prettiest but I'm a renter  as long as everything works fine  the grounds are well kept  and my basic needs in amenities are met I'm happy.  The elementary school these are zoned for has a boys and girls club attached  plus it's on the UNLV campus so the kids get to do little field trips and things there. The neighbors are cool when I've spoken to them  but they mind their own business  which is hard to come by in this ridiculous city.   All in all though  I wish I would've moved here back when I first saw them in 05. I would've saved myself A LOT of issues.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,When I moved in I was happy with the apartment itself but I was displeased with the customer service. Then one day  this wonderful girl named Kristie started working and it's been all butterflies and rainbows. If she renews her contract  I'll renew my lease.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,This is almost the worst place in vegas to live. I lived there for a few years  an after begging them to fix problems I was having.  they refused. So my lease finally ran up! I moved an thought I was finally done with this badly managed company! Ha not so fast. They said I had another month Wich was bull. They send me a bill for over 3k an then to collection. All the probs that I was having they decided to charge me for. An also charged me for 3 trash bags I left (all the dumpsters were full) an charged me 300$ each bag! Then charged me for the month (they said I left early) 1200$ an a early contract fee. This place is a joke. They have a freekin boiler to get ur hot water that will kill ur skin. It's so bad. An bed bugs too. All around horrible place to think of living. Not to mention all the homeless people walking around begging.
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,"BED BUGS! BED BUGS! BED BUGS!  I've lived in Vegas most my life and never had a problem with bed bugs until this place. I'm assuming its due to the poor quality of the units that the bugs can travel from one apartment to the next. Be aware though because management will not tell you if they're are bed bugs in your building!   Besides having to throw away all my furniture; bed  2 couches  all pillows and linens. The management was terrible! Took them 3 days to ""inspect"" to make sure I had bugs another week to do a treatment then I had to wait another 2 weeks for final treatment. In the meantime the apartment was uninhabitable for the whole month! They said it was safe to stay after the first treatment but I woke up with severe bites every time I slept in my own apartment.  Christie the manager is very unprofessional. She would never call me back or if I did get ahold of her she was busy. I'm talking a months worth of no phone call back from anyone. This created extra stress cause I mean who has the funds to just stay in a hotel until my apartment was habitable again? All I ever received from the front office was attitude and poor customer service.  I ended up just paying through my lease because they wouldn't let me break it even though my apartment was infested and didn't even live in the actual apartment.   Do not sign a lease here. All the negative reviews are true. Pay 100 bucks more a month for somewhere else  unless you like bed bugs crawling on your face while you're sleeping! Gross!"
Apartments;Home Services;Real Estate,Ok heres the thing. I do not rate Cobblestone creek as a four star apartment complex. I do  however  believe that for the amount of rent I am paying for a one bedroom apartment  I am very happy with this establishment and would rate it four stars for value.  Cons: Sure  the repair guys take a little longer than usual to fix things  and I have to wait a little while for the water to get hot sometimes. I realize it's not in the safest neighborhood  and it does kind of smell like smoke on the property all the time. The workout room isn't the prettiest  the assigned parking  though abundant  is a mess (people park in spots that aren't theirs)  and the people walking around this place are a little creepy. You have to use a rather expensive laundry card to do your laundry in the limited amount of washers and dryers  but I can understand that they probably don't want random people from the street coming in and using their stuff (taking up the machines!).  Pros:  It's close to the strip and any establishment you could possibly visit in a regular day. I can walk to CVS or sushi/ pizza/ get my nails done etc. My apartment is cozy and it feels secure. The ladies in the leasing office have been nice to me  I've never had any issues with them. You're paying next to nothing to live here (I'm from California so you know what that means for rent $$$). There is a ton of parking for any friends or visitors you may have. And people say there is a bug problem  but really its just a few crickets that come out at night. I've only ever seen 2 in my place. And they're crickets! Not scorpions.   What I'm basically saying is  it's really not as bad as people say it is for the amount of money you're paying. All the things I see people complaining about on here are petty. I mean what do you expect when you're paying $490- $700 for either a studio or a 2/3 bedroom apartment! Someone to wipe your a** when you're done taking a crap? If you want all the bells and whistles of a nicer apartment complex  you're gonna have to pay for it. End of story.   Bottom line  I know there are nicer places to live  but for my budget and needs  Cobblestone Creek is great.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Awesome amazing love this place!  The owner is amazing and the sweetest person ever!  Thank you Julie!
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,If you are looking for a relaxing way to relieve pain  sore muscles and lose inches around the waist  these body wraps are highly recommended.  Julie is by far the most attentive and caring professional I have met.  She prepares you with the heating pads and water for the enduring hour of heat.  Once you leave the salon you feel incredible.  I was referred to by a friend and now I  am a monthly member.  Check this place out
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Still no word back from them!! Wow great customer service. Beware of the scams and shadiness of this company. Make sure that you talk to someone when cancelling or else you'll be out your money and they will never contact you! Tried calling the other day and of course no one answered.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I really recommend  the wellness bodyheatwrap thee owner Julie is such a sweetheart  always checking on you fast service and Michael he is so awesome  very  kind and very  good customer service  both of them make you feel so comfortable
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Julie was awesome! Accomodating and friendly. I saw this deal on groupon and I couldnt let that deal pass by. I contacted julie and was able to get me in the next day. Oh man this wraps are awesome. I was sweating just like how i sweat when i do my zumba...lol Julie's personality even made it more awesome. She explained everything before she started wrapping me up. Explained to me what I need to do post procedure. Cant wait to go back for my second session.  I guess i knocked off one star because I had a little hard time finding them. Once i Got to the parking lot and saw the bldg and unit number  the sign says sabat salon so i wasnt sure if I had the correct address  yet i went in and figured out wellness body wraps is inside sabat salon. Lol
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Nice  and clean facility...smells really nice too...lol.  I seen them on Groupon and called to see the availability.   She was able to get me in the same day and even offered a price match with Groupon which I found convenient and just great business. .will definitely continue wrap sessions here.  Been to many different places that offer  wraps and this one by far exceeds the rest.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I love this place! The staff is GREAT and the environment is clean. Yes the wraps do their job. Just try it
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,An Achilles injury left me sidelined for the past few months so naturally I ended up putting on some weight not being able to do anything. Broken Achilles or not  the big blue war machine still required me to tape in for my bi-annual PT test. I was stressed and out of options so I decided to take an unconventional holistic approach to try and lose inches fast.   Another fluffy AF comrade suggested to try a wrap to try and slim down and lose water weight; so I did. The staff here were nice and friendly. They explained the process and the expectations during the treatment as well as maintenance needed between sessions and what to do the the night before the tape in.   A few 50 minute wrap sessions in conjunction with hot yoga (another review) and cutting out salts I was able to drop 4 inches and about 11 pounds in about a week. While I do not recommend doing this all the time; it got the results that I needed. Those results were worth every penny.  AF safe and PT verified...
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Love this place since I started going here and doing the infrared body wrap I have lost 6% body fat. I also no longer have any post workout pain. I try to get a wrap at least twice a week.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Wasn't sure what to expect  but I loved it!!   I Bought the Groupon and now I'm hooked!!  I have made another appointment and will be purchasing a package when I return!!
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I would definitely recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a great experience at a great price! The atmosphere was so therapeutic and the staff was very gracious  I will certainly visit  wellness again :)
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,My sister saw these infrared wraps on groupon and booked hers so of course being the little seester I had to copy! Was super stoked after I read what these wraps help do...so the wraps are usually 30 a session and you can go every day if you liked! Julie was amazing and very informative and helpful. You are basically wraps in these huge pads over your skin and are laying on a small bed comfortable besides the ton of sweat that is dripping off of you! It was for 50 minutes at of a tempature 85 to 100. It was amazing. Only bought one on groupon to try it out but will definitely be coming back for more. If your workout or don't and want to detox I highly suggest these wraps with Julie!
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I bought a groupon for 2 wraps for my wife and the experience was ok. First wrap the woman was nice and put my wife in a nice room and the wrap seems like it works. The second visit was not good at all  an older lady was very rude and short tempered with my wife. Overall we will not be going back.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Amazing experience!! Meet Julie for my first body wrap which was highly recommended  as a man I was a little nervous but after all said and done I was impressed. I scheduled a second appointment with Julie.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I was referred by a friend since she was losing weight and looked amazing so I thought I should try it. I am so glad that I did and am now a monthly member. Julie is so sweet  she gives me water and puts on my favorite movie or show on her individual tvs. I would highly recommend her wrap to anyone. I have lost inches due Wellness Body wrap.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,As a first time client of body wrapping  I will say that I am quite impressed. The process was not intrusive whatsoever and more relaxing than I anticipated.  As for Wellness Body Wraps Health Studio..  Pro's:  - VERY clean studio. From the moment I walked in I was impressed. Everything was immaculate from the waiting area to the bathroom  the wrapping room (Is that what it is called?) hallways  etc. Warm decor throughout as well. Having such a clean studio put me at ease and made me felt welcome. As a previous reviewer said  it even smelled great!  - Joelle the Technician was welcoming  knowledgeable  answered all of my questions  checked on me a few times during the treatment to ensure I was comfortable and asked if I needed anything.  - They start you off somewhat slow as far as the heat to make sure your body reacts positively to the treatment. In other words  they care about their clients and the success of the program.  - I don't have any other experiences with this service  but the price seems very fair and they have quite a few packages to purchase that will decrease the cost per visit.   - They give you the option to listen to a multitude of different music channels or watch Netflix. It makes the time fly by!  - Located in an easy to find shopping center with plenty of parking.  - Julie the owner was also very welcoming  polite  courteous and professional. Top notch to say the least.  Cons:  As cliche as this may seem  I honestly can't think of any negatives of this place or the process.  I will be visiting frequently and I suggest you do as well. You will not regret it!
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I've been many places to get an infrared body wrap but this is by far the best spot. Great ambiance and people. Julie really cares about what she does and makes a point to educate you along with making you comfortable during the process.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I have been coming here for a year now and I absolutely love this place. Everyone comments on my losing inches and I always feel so wonderful after a wrap. The staff is like family to me. This is definitely my happy place. :)
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I had a couple of friends go to Julie with amazing results  so I've been going to her 3x/week for 2 weeks and the results are already fantastic! I have a ton of energy afterwards for the rest of the day  and my appetite is curbed. I also have chronic back pain which has subsided greatly  not to mention the inches I've lost off my waist. I do hit the gym a couple days a week as well  but adding the wraps to my regimen has greatly sped up the process and results I'm aiming for. Definitely give it a try!
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,A very relaxing time each time !!! Marci is awesome and just very nice and attentive !!! Place is nice and clean and mood is just where one can decompress and relax ! Somehow helps with me sleeping better :)
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I have seen these wraps advertised on groupon and finally decided to try it.  Especially since it was a great deal.  Julie is professional yet cheerful  educational and friendly.  She answered all my questions on how these wraps work and gave me the tips such as drink lots of water before  recommend weights training after wrap (if you are trying for cellulite reduction)  2-3x per week and eating clean.  This is no quick fix however I did feel amazing after. I sweated a lot  through my clothes.  I felt as if my body was sweating out all the toxins. Not sure if it was because of the wrap but I slept very well that night and woke up refreshed. I felt full of energy the next day and I do admit ... Felt slimmer and skin tighter.  I admit it's partially due from the wrap but also my lifestyle of working out and eating a balanced diet. I have only done one session but am very satisfied with my groupon purchase without even having my second session yet. That will be in a few days.  I will keep you posted...
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,I would give it a 5+ if possible.  Julie and her staff are super attentive  knowledgeable and always make me feel great.  Check out their groupons for a deal! The wraps do work.  Combined with a healthy lifestyle I've lost 10 lbs and inches.
Weight Loss Centers;Beauty & Spas;Doctors;Health & Medical;Medical Spas;Chiropractors;Naturopathic/Holistic;Reiki;Physical Therapy,Bought the 2 package groupon back in the begining of may  booking my appt. was so easy as Julie is open later for us 8-5 working folks :) I had a wrap done once somewhere else and never thought I would do it again. but since coming to see Julie at wellness body wraps I am in love. I started with the every 3 days during may and I fill and look better. now with her june special I bought 1 month and I am coming almost every day I can squeeze into my busy schedule. Julie is amazing of her knowledge of the wraps and a great listener. I will keep coming back !!!! book your session soon  you wont regret it :)
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Took my son to them after being the only ones that would see him short notice. Best dicision ever. The staff was amazing. Family owned and really cared. Won't go anywhere else. Thank you for your service. See you soon.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Great place. Ask for Dr. Keller for your eye exam. He is very helpful and accommodating.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,I've been going to True Eyecare since they opened their doors and would never go anywhere else again. The staff is knowledgeable  friendly  and value my time and business. They have a large selection of frames and products.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,This is by far the best eye doctor that I've been to in a very long time. The doctor was so thorough yet he didn't take forever. Neither did Virginia. Who was also a gem. :)  They stand out from other establishments who just go through the motions in life. Keep up the great work True Eyecare. I'll definitely be recommending you to friends  family & coworkers.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Virginia and DJ was so nice and  professional.  I took my parents here for their spcial lens recommended by costco eye care team.  They were able to make for good price and super fast! Once they have special order lens   they will cut there on site  so we dont have to wait forever like other places.  I been to lots other places but no one can beat their service and prices in town.  This place is the best!
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,WOW!!! I just left and have to leave this now! What a beautiful company  what sweet amazing honest hardworking people! I've worn glasses since 2nd grade  I'm 25. I have had eye exams almost every year since & I have never had a doctor re-examine the clarity of the contacts after the initial exam. Usually they just do one exam  give me some trial contacts & call it a day. Dr. Keller gave me two trial pairs & reexamined my eyes maybe 3 or 4 times? We are in Vegas for EDC weekend  we have some time & money for me to actually get an eye exam knocked out  and traveled here from 12 hours away. I called maybe 10 places that were in route to Vegas  only one other place was as sweet as Virginia here at True Eyecare. So literally the best place I found from Vegas to North California. They're prices are also the best & their glasses selection was awesome!! So if it's important to you to support good people need look no further  get your bum over there! Beautiful people over at True Eyecare  thank you for everything!
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Fast and great service! I received my prescription eyeglasses in two days. Virginia helped all three of us from understanding costs to taking measurements. Overall very glad with the service and quality of glasses.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Walked in and was greeted kindly by DJ. Love the staff! Very friendly and helpful. They got me all set up with my classes and contacts. I am very satisfied :)
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Awesome service! I'm only in town until tomorrow but am able to pickup my glasses within less than 24 hours. Doctor was informative and friendly. Staff was efficient and friendly too. Prices were good too.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,I initially walked in because of the high yelp reviews  and I was not disappointed. Virginia was the technician that helped me out. She was very friendly and even called my insurance company in order to confirm that a reimbursement would be possible. She explained the BOGO deal and was happy to answer the questions I had about the EYEmed form and polycarbonate lens. I got 2 frames for ~$80  excluding the $200 allowance from my insurance company  so the total came out to ~$40 for each glasses. They have both generic and high ended brands like Coach. I was leaving for college the next day  so I was pleasantly surprised to know that they made the glasses on the spot for me! They didn't have enough material for the 2nd frame so it will be shipped to me when it's ready for a $10 fee. I was out of the door in less than 2 hours with a pair of new glasses. Overall I am extremely pleased with both customer service and glasses. I will be coming back again and I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to purchase new glasses!
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Been wearing glasses for many years and never have had customer service like this before. The minute you walk through the door  it feels warm and welcoming with no pressure to take out a second mortgage on your new glasses. There is a large frame selection to choose from and the staff was always so very helpful in making recommendations. After all said and done and for the amount of money I spent  I was ready to wait two weeks for them to be ready. Then to top it off  the guy tells me my glasses will be ready in a hour!!!! Boom!!  I'm never going anywhere else again! Love this place and will definitely be back soon.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,These people are the best!!!! Bought a pair of glasses for $500 at Pearl Vision and the glasses went bad before a year was up. They wanted $525.00 for new lenses with no warranty. Virginia at True Care sold me new lenses for $264 with a warranty and it only took 7 days to process. PLEASE  before you go to Pearl or anywhere else  check with the people at True Care.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,This optical shop is a hidden gem! The manager is so friendly and helpful. I support small family businesses and this is one of them. Despite being a small business their prices are way better than the corporate chains I called! I have no insurance which also made this place a good find. They have a decent selection of eyewear at great prices! I ordered contact lenses at online prices. Their optician is very good. He is focused so don't expect too much conversation unless you're asking tons of questions. My girlfriend also decided to get her prescription renewed here and ordered a new pair of glasses. We will definitely return.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,We purchased the Anti-Reflective coating glasses with Coach frame for our teen daughter couple of weeks ago  and she totally LOVES it!! Her vision highly improved and received so many cool compliments that I just have to rave about you guys! Thank you True Eyecare for recommending this! I would've never thought of it. Your expertise and knowledge..your friendliness and concern about my daughter's vision's needs went beyond our expectations. You just made us as your loyal customers and definitely will be coming back to your store.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,Best experience I've had at an optometrist. They have really good prices for eye exams. I got a prescription written for glasses and two brands of contacts. The woman in the front was very friendly and very helpful and I was in and out within an hour. Very good prices and service.
Eyewear & Opticians;Optometrists;Shopping;Health & Medical,I read the reviews on Yelp and decided to give this place a go. I was not disappointed. The service is amazing and prices are also very good.They have a nice selection of glasses. Virginia helped me and she was so nice   she did not pressure me one bit but helped me decide costs between glasses and frames. It's a private family owned business.Highly recommend this place for all your contacts  eyeglasses and eye exams!
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,"Only been moved in for 8 days and already not too pleased. Maintenance have been here 4x already. Microwave is broke never worked  balcony screen is broke  bath tub leaks to 1st floor every time I bathe  and maintenance is horrible  the same young guy keeps coming into my place to ""fix things"" but tries to make personal conversation  asking me personal questions. Asked me if I wanted to model for his friends mixtape cover??? WTF??? And the landscape guy pulls over to try and pick me up from the bus stop!!! Seems like these  employee maintenance men want are to score with pretty young tenants rather then to remain professional and do their job which made me very uncomfortable to live in my own home already!! I'm appalled at this situation and already reported one the maintenance men of his inappropriate behavior. Other then that the area is nice and quiet and right in the middle of the art district. That's what I love about it. I will not be renewing my lease and would not recommend anyone to move here especially if your young and pretty these employees don't know how to control themselves very inappropriate!!"
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,What a wonderful affordible apartment complex. The rent is quite reasonable. And you get a good amount of space for what you're paying.   If you opted to select one of the upstairs apartments  you won't even miss out on there being no fitness room or center here because the stairs are super steep. You'll be getting your StairMaster experience every day.   Youe bathroom has a jacuzzi jet feature  which is quite fabulous.
Home Services;Apartments;Real Estate,I live in these apartments my upstairs neighbors are rude. I detest speaking to neighbors they start borrowing things. I reported these people twice they run a vacuum cleaner over your head at 4 am or 6 am on a Saturday and Sunday morning. There dog run around the floor they slam things on the floor it's like soon they know i'm home noise begin as if they want whom ever living under them to leave. it was so bad one day i almost called metro i'm dealing with this every day. They walk hard like big foot it's just rude neighbors they wash clothes eight at night your hearing the washer going  dog barking  running across the floor I know they doing things out of spike. should I move  call metro  are tell the office again?
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,i went in for gel nails... this guy whos nail technicin certificate had expired started doing acrylics... i said im here for gels. they said this is how we do gels... so they do a full set of acrlics and the  the gel polish on top. how stupid. i kept having to ask for then shorter and it took 45 min for my nails to be done. i hate this place and their employees and will never be back.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,i love this place great service and always nice clean and comfortable thank you from lovesprincessshop.bigcartel.com
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Great pricing  gorgeous work  superb customer service. Everyone here says hello when you walk in and they take the time to get to know you. Linda is super creative if you're looking for one of a kind nail design. I have been a customer for over 10 years  so happy the owners opened another location. Best in the industry.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,I came here last week on two separate occasions. First for a pedicure. It was the best pedicure I have ever had. They really took their time and it showed! I returned later in the week for a gel manicure and I it was great as well. She actually fixed my cuticles unlike most places. Im very disappointed that my gels lifted after only a week. Usually I can get closer to three weeks out of gels. I gave four star because the pedicure and manicure was incredible  but the gels  not so much!
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,I finally found the perfect nail salon. Super friendly  very clean organized place! I had to remove what was left of my old set and didn't even hurt! They were super gentle and super nice. Gave me exactly what I wanted! Will definitely be coming back and I highly recommend Royal nails and spa if you haven't found an amazing nail salon yet!
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Came here for a groupon special. Linda was very polite  funny  well spoken  and was able to answer my questions about nail care with ease as she did a great job on my hands and feet. The massage chairs are really nice and the whole place is clean and modern looking too. Only complaint is the smell of acetone  but that may be common elsewhere. I would certainly go back
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Love this place Must go try them out ! They have a special rite now because they just opened !! But I feel like a loyal customer already!! Angel did my pedicure and she did an amazing job and Kevin did my acrylics and I loved what an amazing job he did as well !!
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Royal Nails leaves you feeling like royalty. They do an excellent job on everything from nails to toes and wax. This is the best kept secret in Las Vegas! If you are looking for perfection this is the place to go!
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Kevin is the best. I have gone to many nail salons on the North side of Vegas and have finally found one that's worth going to. My nails are perfect every time  and he takes the time to make sure they are! If I could give 10 stars  I would.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Took my family to get Mani-pedis. 5 pedis 4 manis   a full set of pink and whites and eyebrow wax. It was my first time at this shop so I made an appointment  it was only fair to give them a heads up. We did not have to wait they took us immediately when we arrived  The shop is extremely clean the staff friendly and accommodating  Linda and her husband are awesome. Linda did my full set and did a fantastic job. Kevin did my pedi and it was absolute heaven. He took his time and the massage  two separate massages OMG. They've only been open 2 weeks  they will be open for a long long time because they're wonderful  oh  they also do facials. Thanks Linda for my gorgeous nails and Kevin for the relaxing pedi. You are my new go to nail salon. BTW this salon is on Craig Road and Decatur in NLV  do not confuse with the other Royal nails.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,First time here. Got a Groupon special. Anna did an excellent job. She's thorough  quiet  and professional. The place was clean and I felt very relaxed. I highly recommend this nail salon!
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,This place is great ! Definitely recommend Angel . I got a gel manicure and it was $25  which is cheaper than most places in Vegas . I originally got my nails done in NJ and was in search of a salon with the same quality . Not only is the quality amazing  but so are the prices . They did not charge to remove the previous gel set i had like every other salon in Vegas. They also have the 10% off coupon here on Yelp . I also previously got a gel pedicure from Angel and she did amazing job . She was very sterile and she did a very good job with cleaning my cuticles. She also massaged my feet and legs . I am definitely going to come as a regular customer and would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for any pampering . They are all also very nice  not to mention .
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,I am always a little nervous to try new nail salons  but some times you just have to  especially if they are closer to home than your usual place. I initially made an appointment for a fill and pedicure for 2pm on a Saturday. When I arrived  I noticed that all 3 nail technicians seemed to have just started working on their customers nails  which was a bit irritating. I was pressed for time and I knew it would be another 30 minutes or so before a technician became available. About 2:25-2:30  another technician walks in and I am immediately thankful. After my fill  I headed to Linda's station. I had decided on a design that I found online that I was obsessing over and was nervous that it would be a difficult one to mimic  but I had nothing to worry about because Linda took one look and was able to match the colors as close to perfect as possible. I was very impressed! My nails turned out beautifully! I would have requested the same on my toes  but I was running out of time. I would have given all 5 starts if I didn't have to wait  but otherwise  no complaints. Just know  they do get busy  but they do a phenomenal job so plan ahead and schedule an appointment beforhand OR don't make any plans for the rest of the day. :)
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,First time here. No appt. Had a special of $25 for gel manicure. There were customers being helped so I hoped for the best and waited. Nail tech was rough on my cuticles and caused raw/redness. I reshaped and filed when I got home. Price was decent but I was not pleased with quality. I won't be returning.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Definitely not a 5-Star deserving nail service. One nail sticks up funny like a ramp off my finger. One of my thumbs has a dip in it. He didn't prime my nail beds until after he had started  so they'll likely lift off in a week. This is frustrating because I told him nails lift easily on me. The girl who painted the design on my ring fingers was very nice and that turned out great! But the shape and curve of the nail itself is not the best I've had.... Could be better.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,I love Royal Nails! I discovered this place through Yelp and was impressed by their nail designs.. This salon has friendly and professional staff. It is clean  organized  and never seems too busy. I have been coming in for my acrylic fills and pedicures. I would highly recommend this place.
Nail Salons;Beauty & Spas;Eyelash Service;Skin Care,Everyone is friendly  can't beat the prices! Kevin is amazing for pedicures. All brand new equipment. Massage chairs are the best I've ever tried. Never had a buttock massage from a chair
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,Stay away from Ovation.  They manage Ensemble and the management is the worst . They abuse the seniors there. They only cleaned up inside because the owner was coming.  The manager Is so rude- her name is Lisa.  The assistant Takeisha is always in her office with blinds and the doors closed.  Forget about them ever being in the office.  They wont fix any service requests.  Its a shame its such a nice building- but the hags in the office should be fired.  My mom moved in here and they treat her like garbage.  Wish the owner knew that when he came the other day.  Not to mention that creep with no legs they let terrorize her and others because he has no legs.  They still don't have the store open and if they do they pick and choose which seniors get to buy things.  They used to have coffee but now they are too cheap to have that.  The gate still doesn't work and the pet area smells so bad .  They never clean the floors and the salon isn't open.  If you try to talk to the manager you can forget it.  Shes locked away and acts like the wizard of oz that you cant too.  She has the nastiest attitude. which makes sense because if you call her boss shes just as nasty ......my poor mom has no money....you would be better off in public housing the way this place is run.  STAY AWAY
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,"We moved in to Ensemble Senior Apartments about a year ago. They've since changed managers at least twice now  that I know of. If you're lucky to be among a few nice and friendly neighbors down your ""hallway""  then it's bearable. But if you're unfortunate enough to be next to a very rude neighbor with 2 small dogs who can't be controlled by their owner  and people who always make it a point to slam their doors shut - then your life would be miserable here. They have no breed restrictions. I've seen 2 pitbulls on the first floor and a large bulldog/pit bull mix I think - scared the heck out of me with that blank stare ""in your face"" type of thing. But nothing compares to our neighbor's dogs who've barked and growled at us  and have barked down anybody who comes close to them. Made a formal written report to property management - took them 2 weeks to email me a letter that we're pretty much on our own as far as this incident goes. What was once a brand spanking new - high end looking complex  has now turned into dog pee stains all over the place  and hallways smelling like dog chow or something else fowl. They'll have cleaning people make it smell halfway decent  but it doesn't last long and it smells nasty all over again. Entrance/Exit doors are not strategically put  only 2 elevators in a 180 or so apartment units - hotel looking type of thing. They haven't quite figured out in a emergency/fire situation how they're going to get the people with disabilities safely out of the building. I agree with Amanda A. - STAY AWAY FROM OVATION - particularly - Ensemble Senior Apartments! The only pluses are: all utilities paid and rent pricing are lower than others for what you get."
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,Lived at Viviani apartments for a year. The staff in the office would always change and so resulted in confusion most of the time. Never gave me a right direct answer to anything. Never arrive on the same day for maintenance issues. I also had couple of friends that lived in the same complex and had pets did not charge them for pet fees. I myself got charged for my pet  than always pointed at saying I did not pick up after my dog by staff members(are u kidding me?) On top of this I got my apt broken into. I left for two days to sleep at a friends house.. this is not the first time this apt had home invasions. Staff did nothing to help. My lease had a month before it ended would not end my contract. And on top of that I always hire a cle a cleaning crew to clean up the apt before I leave.. the company emailed me saying there going to need another 200$ because I spilled Gatorade on the carpet. Kinda nonsense. Because it was a small amount of carpet space and now I had a credit of 70 and now there taking that too. I DO NOT WRITE REVIEWS. BUT I FEEL THAT PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT THERE GOING TO GET THEMSELEVES INTO. THIS AREA HAS MULTIPLE BREAK INS. IT IS NOT SAFE I'M THAT AREA. ITS SO EASY FOR THESE PEOPLE. PLEASE BE CAREFUL FOR YOURSELF AND YOUR LOVED ONES.
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,if i could leave 0 starts i would.  they are not a fair group of people.  they take advantage of people.  avoid them
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,I recently moved to Las Vegas from New York. The plan was to move into Madera  but  did not sign becausethe apartment was in sub-parcondition  and misrepresented (unintentionally). Although the property Manager (Yvonne) was delightful and did everything in her power to make up for the barrage of mistakes  The VP of Ovation Properties  Wendy White  is a disgusting and rude person. She is entirely unreasonable and childish.  I not stress enough how unprofessional Wendy White  the Vice President is.  During this time  we viewed all Ovation Properties within Summerlin and realized that they are all over-priced  and not even close to a decent value. In all  this was a horrifying experience  and an unnecessarily stressful way to start off a new life in a new city.  I will never  ever reside under Ovation Properties solely because of Wendy White.
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,So a few months back  elevate employees checked out our apartment for cracks that would have formed from settling. We didn't think anything of it and figured they were just looking for something superficial. They weren't and they failed to give us the respect of letting us know the true damage.   Last week I was walking around this construction area and saw the pillars on the outside of the building a cracking and bowing out. Not by just a little but a lot.    The buildings are sinking so bad you can actually see DAYLIGHT through the gaps between the walls and ceiling. In building 3 the foundation concrete has a crack forming as thick as your thumb all the way down one hallway. It's truly scary how severe the problem is.  My wife got ahold of the vp Laurie from Ovation corporate to ask for our deposit and this months rent so we can move to a safer place. She told us they wouldn't and we had to live here till our lease is up next year and that they went gonna do any repairs till the end of this year. Mind you  the pool/jacuzzi/grill amenities are closed because of this.  So just FYI if you ever consider an ovation property this is the consideration the have for you. The cold shoulder from the VP and the lack of concern for our safety is troubling
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,I have lived at the Tesora property on Post Rd for 9 months and had a great experience with staff and the facilities they provide. However  I was informed that my rent would increase by $125/month if I sign another 12 month lease.  I find that to be astounding.  I toured several other properties and asked them what their typical increase is each year.  ALL of them said they will not raise rent more than $25/month.  When I mentioned this issue to Ovation  the management company  they told me the housing market has gone up so rents should too.  They said they could bring in new people at that higher rate. They have no regard for customer loyalty.  I have been a great tenant and have always paid rent on time  cleaned up after my pet  and have been respectful towards others.    I did not want to move  but I want to be with a management company that I can trust for years to come.  I have noticed other residents who are deciding to leave as well because of their rent hikes.  I cannot recommend them.
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,I moved into an Ovation property in April. I regret that decision as Verona apartments have been nothing but trouble. Something that should have clued me in was the inappropriate comment made by the apartment manager about how much money I make. Every time I called about a problem  and that was often  they acted like it was a supreme inconvenience. And about 2 months ago they sold Verona apartments. Now the poor new owners are scrambling to fix everything that Ovation management messed up. It's a sad situation. If I were you I would stay far away from an Ovation property.
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,"Such a shame. The properties themselves are above average in the Vegas area but the management completely ruins that. I originally tried to move to Arzano in boulder area but thanks to yelp  I actually changed my mind. The reviews all sound very bad in spite of how affordable and new the places look. I decided to scout a little on my own and all of the reviews had a lot a validity so I asked to transfer before I moved in and they agreed. I actually found a place closer to where I'm usually around which is west Vegas and it was a little more expensive but also had much more space and a 2 car garage. I had already committed with fees and deposits but didn't want Arzano so I took about an hour to think about it and decided to take it and emailed the girl that offered it because I was already out of town. The next day she tells me she already gave it away. I don't know how that's possible because when I talked to her  she was leaving for the day. But  she said the people came in before she got the email. I was starting to get stressed because I had already forked over 3 months up front plus all of the fees. So  after some explaining  the manager recommend I go to a Tivoli. Worst. Mistake. Ever. I don't even know where to begin. The management  the landscapers  the maintenance  the security....all very rude and unorganized. Constantly making clerical errors and then blaming them on me. And even taking it a step further and trying to evict me from THEIR mistake. A KID DROWNED IN THE POOL HERE. It's hard to go in the water without thinking there's been a dead kid in the water.  They seem to pick on me for some reason but I'm reading some of the other reviews and the others that are writing bad reviews seem to have the same type of experience.  I always pay my rent on time. I never bother neighbors unless they repeatedly bother me...like my upstairs neighbor who I've asked nicely to stop his bad habits which unnecessarily annoy me at all hours but he just looks at me and laughs. I've asked management to handle it and they just shrug it off. I guess no one else lives below him and can't hear the stuff he does...(um duh!). They tried towing my car even though it's here often and I'm sure the guard knows my car because he's eve mentioned that he does because I'm the only one that backs in. They put these very sticky stickers on my car. It's like super glue and is not fun trying to get off especially having a nice car. The guard even admitted knowing its my car but said ""a rule is a rule"". My parking pass fell ONE DAY and I get tagged yet I've seen multiple cars just in my little area that take up my spot on multiple different nights for multiple weeks and have never seen any of them get tagged. I know which cars belong just from seeing the same ones every night...kind of like mine. Yet  I get tagged and these guests don't? Lame. Also  on multiple nights there are kids blasting music at the pool and the guard will just walk by and say they have to leave but they just look and laugh and he walks away. I'm there one night by myself  trying to enjoy the amenities I pay for and the guard kicks me out because I didn't have this little pool pass. I have the key but not the pool pass and he calls his supervisor to ask for assistance in kicking me out. I had no music. I wasn't even talking. Just sitting in the Jacuzzi (where the dead kid drowned) and he has no problem forcing me out...( seriously? ).  Horrible managing. Such a shame because  like I said decent looking place.  Oh  appliances are strangely temperamental. They look new but sometimes they work and sometimes they don't. The cable to my place has a break in the line and its not working correctly. I tried calling Cox to fix it but they want to charge me so I asked maintenance and they don't want to get involved. Why should I have to pay for something that isn't my responsibility. That is not good management. The water lines have rust in them and have also backflowed nasty water which makes me wonder if it ever happens that was clear or I just wasn't paying attention. My dishes aren't always clean and same with clothes washer. It's like flint Michigan here. Nasty.  So  after starting to call and question about these issues  I get a mysterious letter saying I am being evicted. I called an attorney and the attorney said it's completely illegal. They tried to evict me for not paying a security deposit from over 7 months before the letter which never showed up on any statements but mysteriously after I'm noticing a lot of health code violations  they try to evict me. The attorney silenced them for a few months. Then  they altered it saying they refuse to renew my lease. I guess if management have that much of a vendetta for me noticing problems  they won't stop until I'm gone so maybe it's a good thing. They can't own up to their mistakes. The management is totally running this place to a short life and these will probably be ghetto very soon."
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,I wish I could put negative stars!!!! IE: Amalfi property. Everything was great when shelling out 4 grand to get in but after the honeymoon was over and the riff raft moved in I started expressing my concerns about the safety of myself and family and my right to a peaceful place to live. Then it started  I got labeled as an nuisance  high maintenance and an racist tenant. After 2.5 years the staff became estranged. I do not recommend this property or Ovation to anyone. Absolutely the most unprofessional and money greedy Corp. I've ever done business with. Let the reviews speak for themselves............
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,I lived in Chateau Calias for about 8 months before I had to move out.  The property was ok but old and expensive.  There were problems from the beginning. They kept coming to me telling me they had made a mistake on my lease and demanding more money.  After that finally got settled  threatening them with legal action  came the pet problem. Dogs were running around with no leashes and owners were not picking up after their pets.   I complained several times and all that happened was an email got sent out.  I even provided unit numbers to Desiree the manager where owners lived that were letting their pets roam free. Nothing was ever done.  Next came vehicles parking in the spaces in front of their garages. This was supposedly against the rules  which I  along with every other tennant  had to sign stating there would be no parking at any time in front of any garage. I had difficulty getting in and out of my own garage because the tennants across the street were parking in front of their garage.  Again I complained to the Manager Desiree and AGAIN I was told that the rules don't apply to everyone and she wouldn't do anything about it.  I would turn in work orders and maintenance would supposedly have fixed the problem. However  the fixes were always shotty at best.  Again I complained to Desiree and again nothing was ever done.  When I moved out  I did a final walkthrough with Desiree and she said everything was good. Now 2 weeks later I am getting a bill for supposed damages such as stains in the carpet  damage to the carpet  walls that were supposedly painted by me and needed repainted  and odors.  I again asked Desiree about this and she said the damage was not discovered until they started cleaning. Just how do stains and damage appear after the final walkthrough where the apt was inspected by  you got it   Desiree Matuk. I have since asked for photos of said damages and was told there were no photos.  After reading some of these other reviews   I guess I need to be prepared for a law suit. My advice to anyone interested in these apts to really think it through before you sign that lease.
Property Management;Real Estate;Home Services,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. There is an underground leak which is causing hazardous unsafe living conditions (horrendous structural damage) in two of the buildings (which tenants are still residing in). Let's just say we are moving out this week. Take a look at the pictures I posted and see for yourself.  Plus  there are tons of bugs all of the time (cockroaches  silverfish which eat holes in your clothing  pincer bugs  and grasshoppers).  The complex is new  and started leasing out the apartments as of this January (which is when me and my husband moved in).  When I called and talked to the Vice President (Laurie) of Ovation this afternoon (the company that owns Elevate)  she said that their engineers say it's ""safe"" to live here (it clearly isn't).   Laurie (the Vice President of Ovation)  said she would give me and my husband a different unit at a different property that Ovation owns  but I wouldn't dare risk our lives by moving to ANY of their properties. Though I did tell her that they should have made that offer 2 months ago (when they inspected our unit  saying that they were looking for small cracks since its ""settling""). I informed her that she should make that offer to all tenants in both buildings  but she said she couldn't because they don't have room on the other properties for all tenants  but they could still move us. Obviously the building damage has gotten much worse since 2 months ago.   Laurie also refuses to give us our deposit back  as well as this months rent.   Elevate has given no email or letter notifications regarding what is occurring here on the property (until today  after I recommended that they do so). It is clear that there is serious structural damage (Laurie said there is an underground leak)  though she did say that there is a plan at the end up August to try and crank the building up  similar to what they did at MGM.  I fear for the lives of the remaining tenants at Elevate (and for the tenants at their other properties  since they clearly have no respect for human life)."
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,The food is usually fresh. The only problem is they have some SALTY ass fries. It never fails  no matter what time or day I go they are always super salty. Hate it.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Although we don't regularly frequent McDonalds for food  but rather the sweet tea  cookies  frappes etc.; tonight was an exception as we headed home from an evening out downtown with east coast guest who wanted a bite.  I was embarrassed that we were in line for over 15mins.  There were approx 5 cars ahead of us.... Southwestern Salad Hot Cakes & Sausage Chocolate Chip Cookies Caramel Sundae I actually placed the car in park  as I feared falling asleep as the wait was soooo long. After waiting more than 5 mins to pay  a few mins to get to the pick up window and over 5 mins sitting waiting on the salad  I began and finished my sundae (and I'm not a fast eater).  I was told that the salad was being made  upon my inquiry on the delay.  They never asked me to pull around for them to bring out the salad  for which I began feeling badly for the cars waiting behind us. The salad was handed to me on its side without acknowledgment or apology for the elongated wait.  What the heck... just RIDICULOUS!!!
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Free Wi-Fi.  Dining is open 24 hours you can't go wrong. The service has gotten much better. I get a Mcdouble every time I'm here. No regilar bun only ketchup and pickles $1.39.  Fries are always fresh. I ask for no added salt. Thank you Jessica.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,This place really sucks! Slow as shit. Only reason I go here is cause nothing is close by. Hire some new workers or get your shit together.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Yeah  I eat at McDonald's. What of it? I am hooked on breakfast sandwiches  okay?  Leave me alone. I don't care if it's a $20 breakfast sandwich from room service or a $3 sandwich from McDonald's. Addicted.  This particular McDonald's is in a gas station  which is pretty dope. And this is a good stop if you're headed to Lee Canyon for skiing.  Fish tank!  There is one at this McDonald's. Say again  fish tank!
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,I Absolutely like this place the stuff is so very nice and Friendly some are know me there They always tell me I know you you always here lol!!  I feel like am home lol!!! My daughter favorite play place area...
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,What a crappy slow drive thru in the mornings! Because there's 2 order screens  your order can easily get mixed up if stupid drivers cut in front of you.  Bad call McDonald's.    Food was slapped on.  But hey  that's why it's fast food.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Something is fishy about this McDonalds. That is all the fishes swimming in the awesome aquarium in the heart of the dining area. This is no ordinary aquarium. It is an aquatic garden. McDonalds made what would've been an ordinary McDonalds attached to a Chevron into a fun restaurant to dine in. Children seemed amazed by the fish. There are seats arranged around the aquarium  that offer closeup views. For guests who are drinking a beverage  there are more comfortable lounge seats that overlook the aquarium.    I was happy with the service  food  and overall experience.   BTW  I uploaded two pictures of the aquarium this businesses Yelp page.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,went with daughter to get a happy meal ordered in drive thru also ordered two pumpkin pies  noticed when we arrived home that happy meal did not have a toy in it and we did not receive pumpkin pies we received one sundae?? and these are the employees that are complainig that they do not make $ 15.00 a hour! what a joke.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Man every fucking time I come here it's long ass lines....it's like these Mutha fuckers ain't got shit prepared..... I go inside and it's even longer... why the fuck am I gunna come pay for this cheap ass shit....I can take my money els where and actually enjoy the shit.. just straight retarded who the fuck is running this shit....
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,The weekday morning crew between 7-9 is the best. I come here almost every morning during that time.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Came through at a busy time. Gave them my order and go figure. It was wrong. Called and they offered to replace my sandwich.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,365 days a year the slowest McDonald's ever. Everyone always giving attitude. Managers sometimes provide good service but not always.   Either hire more people or more competent people.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,I live down the street from this McDonald's so I've been here more times than I'd like to admit but the mornings are always really busy. They usually have the bozos working the night shift so make sure you check your order before driving off.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Do not go to this location!!!!! They charge you more compare to other location and give u repackage food!!  I order a southwest salad with grill chicken  got home ready to eat when I see that there are some other dressing on the salad and the veggie looked old  the grill chicken was cold.  I was so disgusted and have to throw it out.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,What can I say about McDonald's??? Picking up food for my mother in law and wifey  mom specifically requested a Big Mac so up I go for a 5 minute drive.   I ordered nuggets  fries and a Big Mac. Guy took my order accurately. I pulled up and told him I'd be paying with Apple Pay  he put the scanner out the window and a second later my order is payed for. Apple Pay is soooo convenient.   Since I ordered like 30 nuggets I asked for extra ketchup which the girl in the second window was nice enough to include. The whole process was probably less than 4 minutes. Fast food was fast. The nuggets were spicy which was weird but I like spicy so it's all good in the hood.   Wifey and mom enjoyed their food  will be coming here again in the near future due to working in the area.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,We love this for daddy-daughter dates!!! We get to enjoy our love for the ocean by sitting at the 2000 gallon salt aquarium  $1 Sundaes and the magical toy you get in a happy meal box. And always the gentleman named Osmel that watches over the dining area remembers my daughter every time ! She won't go if he's not there! Such pride in his work .  Thanks for a special place to go.  Great service again. Still trying to find Dori & Nemo!
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,When you order two items  one being cookies and the other an ice cream cone totaling a whopping $1.62 is it too much to expect your order to be correct. Guess I just ask for too much. I get handed my cookies and the lady says have a great day. I said that we ordered an ice cream cone also and we didn't get it. She proceeds to tell us to drop the attitude and that is where we developed one. The manager didn't exactly help the situation as he seemed to have lost his spine on the way to the window. Sadly customer service is at a loss at McDonalds. Fortunately I don't frequent them. If they want a lesson in customer service  visit the Dutch Brothers on E Tropicana. They are the gold standard!!
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,"If could give this McDonald's 0 stars I would. I ordered my food 3 times. First the intercoms intertwined. Second times was in person and she confirmed the order that was wrong so I reiterated my order and she still got it wrong. Now mind you I don't expect ivy leagues to be working a fast food drive thru but I couldn't imagine how hard it is to get the correct order when it's told to you. It's a five second memory thing. Not a memorization of the acidity of red blood cells in a cancerous cells. Jimmy  a fatter man than most  had a huge attitude issue  then refuse to correct my order because I didn't pay .69 cents to receive the pie I had order THREE times. I'm appalled at the way he treated me and the fact that he didn't fix my order correctly not only with the pie but with the sandwhich he gave me the wrong order again. Mind you he's not a person who took English honors but I would think he could understand sausage and egg mcmuffin when he works at MCDONALDS!!!!! Anyways I tried to give back all my food and get a refund and he refused to give my money back pretty sure better business bureau won't be happy and the supposed franchise owner ""Fresco"" (highly doubt his name is fresh but w.e) won't be please either. Jimmy f u  I hate your hermaphradite looking ass  I hope your Apple Watch (it was probably a knock off version Motowatch) knocks and breaks against the pie machine and you think of me."
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,I know its just McDonalds not the White House but they could have better personality. Everyone there is just so dry and impersonal. I only go there if I'm really in a last minute bind.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Fast drive thru and really good service. I feel like no matter what the line looks like  it still moves pretty quick.   McDs is always the same. Same food  cheap prices. love the Choc chip Frape and Vanilla Latte is my favorite. Starbucks is nice  but don't sleep on the coffee products here.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. I was in the drive thru for almost 10 minutes and then they had me wait in the parked spot for another 5. I had to go inside to retrieve the rest of my order.  I talked to a lady in a blue shirt  and I watched her service 10 other in store customers before she got to my order  which was sent 15 minutes ago. Terrible service overall.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Been to this Mcdees many times. The food has always been fresh  hot  the service prompt and friendly. Clean restaurant and restrooms.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Awesome aquarium display  clean  and fast service Rare to find a worker happy to do his job  he made everyone feel welcome  he was interacting with all customers  not really with me.. But his personality brought a smile to my face ( good enough for me =). )  just by hearing him with other guests and the kids  a mom was ordering and her little boy kept trying to talk and ask him for a toy  he didn't ignore him and wasn't rude he just said let me take your Mommys order first and you'll have to ask mommy If you can have a toy.  Kudos to you for not ignoring the lil boy ! Definitely good vibes... Very friendly and outgoing . Only wish I caught his name   your an awesome guy !
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Don't go here if you are in a rush.  The drive through is SO SO SO slow...... but if you do go  then make sure you check your order before driving off.  We routinely avoid this location and go out of our way to another one just because they always get your order wrong.  Without fail they will get your order wrong.  We have even called and told the manager several occasions and they give us a free meal which helps  I guess.  We dont' eat at Mcdonald's a lot but when we do my kids love the toys in the happy meals...... Yeah  well you need to check for those too cause they often times forget them.  It's so sad to get home and see your kid open his happy meal in excitemnt for the newest toy and BAM.  Nothing.  :(
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,Early morning stop   was not very happy  worst McDonalds ever. Greasy meat  dry muffins  orange juice seemed to be watered down  horrible service   it seemed like we were a inconvenience to them. Will not return to this location.
Food;Burgers;Restaurants;Fast Food,"This McDonald's really pisses me off! They love to play games in the morning especially on weekends! I have been on several occasions and without any exaggeration I kid you not you will wait a minimum of 10 minutes!! I decided to YELP about it this time because it was a total of 14 minutes which in all honesty is beyond ridiculous! What is the point of you calling your business establishment a ""fast food"" place or hell even a drive-thru? More like a sit and park thru? Nah I'm good I will drive up to the McDonald's of Tropicana and fort Apache from here on out since they seem to be understaffed on weekend morning! To top it all off I get to the window to inquire with the employee as to why the hell it took so long and she nonchalantly answers ""oh it's not that bad we are just understaffed"" o said oh really? 14 minutes in your drive thru isn't that bad?! o_O hmmph!"
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I've been attending classes @ ILKB for over a year. I just can't seem to stay away  it's the best whole body workout. Try a class and you'll see what I am talking about. Motivating  friendly instructors make it fun and intense all at the same time.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Love this place!! If you're looking to see fast results  Ilovekickboxing is the place to go! The instructors are really motivating and they help you reach your goal by pushing you to work harder. I've been going to Ilovekickboxing for almost a year and I've seen results in my body. The class focuses on a full body workout and different types of kickboxing techniques! Definitely recommend this place!!!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I just did my first class and it was amazing. My sister has been going here for a month and already dropped two dress sizes! There is a very diverse crowd  as far as experience and shape  so it's really a class for anyone. The instructors are extremely nice and helpful. Your first class  you even get one-on-one time w/ instructor to teach you the moves! You get gloves when you sign up  and lots of incentives for referrals.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I love iLoveKickboxing! I found this through a Groupon  and got hooked during my first class (and bought more classes!). I've never done kickboxing before  but the trainers kindly walked me through the steps  and it was very easy to catch on. There's a family feeling that welcomes you as soon as you walk in  and it keeps me coming back. Everybody is at a different fitness level  but each one is trying to get better and improve  so the overall mentality is very positive and encouraging!   I love the trainers  I love the location  I love that I added kickboxing to my fitness workouts. I've gone to different days and different times  and every time  the trainer gets you sweating to the music. I always leave with a smile on my face  because I know I've spent a valuable hour working out.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,7 weeks in. From 190 now 163. That's with all the muscle I'm gaining.  Can't complain about that!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,"About 3-4 weeks ago I had to cancel my membership with the I Love Kickboxing location on North Rainbow Blvd.  in Las Vegas.  I had called the local number to see if this could be done over the phone.  I received voice mail on two separate occasions and did leave messages each time - neither was message was returned.  The third time the phone was answered by a very polite younger sounding woman that explained I must go into the location that I signed up at and that no set appoint need be made.  I did just that one evening at around 7:15 p.m.  I was told by the receptionist that I must wait for the instructor as she was the ""only one"" that could cancel a membership.  So - I waited the fifteen minutes with my 3 year old daughter and wife.  When the class was over a woman approached me who refused to offer her names other than to say she was the Assistant Manager. She went on to state that I would have to wait until she was done speaking to two perspective members providing them with sign-up information  (a conversation that had not yet started)... she assured me this would only be a minute or two and walked away while I was speaking to her.  She talked to the two women for over an hour leaving me  my 3 year old  and wife waiting.  It seem apparent that she hoped we would just leave and give up.  She completely ignored me and when I attempted to politely speak to her again she turned away and continued on with her sales pitch to her perspective customers.  After almost 90 minutes waiting she was clearly annoyed that I was still there family in tow.  I explained at this point that I was upset and that it was ridiculous in my ming that we would be kept waiting that length of time.  She became very smug and sarcastic and I replied that she was pissing me off now.  She then began yelling at me and through her paperwork on the floor along with her pen.  My 3 year old was visibly upset as was my wife and I.  After a couple minutes of her talking to me about respecting her other wise she would not provide me with a cancellation at all... she then completed the cancellation form.   For what amounted to literally less then 60 seconds of paperwork she forced my wife  3 year old daughter  and myself to wait 90 minutes.  When I asked if there was anything further I needed me to do her answer was ""use the door"".  - I'll clearly will not be feeling the need to pay to be treated like that from this company ever again. ~ John V."
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I truly stand behind what I Love Kickboxing has to offer. I started with the 3 classes for $19.99 and fell in love on the first class. It is an active  motivating class! It has completely changed my life. I have lost 2 pant sizes  and even though I am only 125 so I don't really need to lose weight  my body has been building muscle and defining. Even when I don't see physical results I see strength results. I used to only do push-ups on my knees when I first started now I can do 20 on my feet. I was able to front kick my first bag over a couple weeks ago and when I first started it barely moved. Besides the physical success I have found my second family. The instructors and the members are by far the most amazing people I have met. I used to be the kind of person who has to have someone with me when I go to work out  now I have no fear walking into the gym because I have my family there supporting me with open arms when I walk through that door. I would highly recommend this gym  especially over a regular gym membership because you don't get the one on one personal attention like you would with I Love Kickboxing. FIVE STARS!!!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,The atmosphere here is encouraging  especially if you are out of shape  the crew gets you pumped and you want to come back the next day.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I saw a posting on Facebook about 3wks ago for 3 classes plus gloves for 19.99 and I thought what the heck  I'll give it a try. I can honestly say it was the best decision I've made. The instructors are very motivational and they push me to be better. I've only been to 5 classes so far and I'm already noticing a difference.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Talk about getting my butt whooped on my first class. My endurance was shot. My arms were tired. More huffing and puffing than punching and kicking on my part.  The trainers (Lindsay  Katrina  Candace) constantly encourage you to work up that sweat and keep up your own pace. The routine's switched up every day  so each class has its unique set of punching and kicking combos and you don't get bored.  Their weekday schedule consists of a morning class at 9:30 and three evening classes at 4:00  5:15  and 6:30. They also offer 10:45 class on Saturday mornings. Sunday's the only day they're closed  but everyone needs a rest day right?  You can get three classes for $20 or five classes for $30 and get a free pair of boxing gloves. After that  you can figure out whether you'd like an unlimited membership or a class card.  After four classes  I've been able to last through most of the rounds and taking fewer breaks! There's definitely a noticeable change in my fitness and it's only with an hour of kickboxing a day. One hour. Get on it.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Yesterday  I completed my first ever kickboxing class . . and it was awesome.  The closest thing to kickboxing I have ever done is Tae Bo with Billy Blanks.  And I thought Billy was motivating!! All of the instructors at this joint are super encouraging and helpful.  Even when they are correcting my crappy form  I do not get offended and they really motivate you to keep going.  Best workout of my life.  I came here on a groupon but foresee a long-term relationship with ilovekickboxing in my future.  At most facilities  especially in this town  no one goes out of their way to speak to you.  Not at ilovekickboxing.  A couple of the other members of the class were very friendly and encouraging to my friend and I after the class.  Crazy hard workout and tons of fun.  As soon as I can raise my arms  I am heading back for another class.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,It's a good workout  but it's the people that make it great. I've trained other martial arts  but find this to be a real challenge. Great way to blow off steam from a bad day
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Best. Workout. EVER! I started at ilovekickboxing.com over a year ago d I've notice a drastic change. My core is strong  my endurance is the best it's been in years  and I have so much fun! I would recommend this place over and over gain!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Very unorganized place.They do not accommodate their guest well.Every time you arrive you are greeted by a different person who tells you different information every time.I would not recommend this place at all that's probably why they offer so many specials because of the foolery
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Been coming to this place for a week now and I must say this place is great!   The trainers are great at paying attention to everyone in the room to make sure each person is doing everything right and getting a really good work out. I'd choose this place over a gym any day which is why I signed up. Everyone makes you feel very welcome!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I am definitely not a kickboxing type person  I don't enjoy hitting anything! Truth be told I would rather be shaking my booty in a Zumba class. However I am hooked on ilovekickboxing! It is probably the most intense workout I have ever done & after 2 weeks I already feel stronger. After my first class I couldn't get out of bed  I was sore in places I never knew existed. I know if I continue the results will be great. Lindsay is a phenomenal instructor who manages to be motivating without being an annoying cheerleader. The group atmosphere is fun & everyone works at their own pace. You work so hard in class you don't have time to care about what anyone else is doing. No judgements here! Come try a class  if you make it through the first one I guarantee you will want to come back.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,Loving my kickboxing class!!!.... Saw a post on Facebook for 3 classes and a free glove for $19.99. Started reading reviews about ilovekickboxing and was intrigued. Ive been looking and wanting a workout that's fun and I found it at ilovekickboxing. The staff are awesome  friendly and helpful. You meet new friends and you look forward to seeing them in class. I've been a member for a while now and will continue to be a member.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,The class was great but the instructors were very pushy into getting a membership & their gym membership is priced higher then other gym memberships. the price almost total up to $425!!! whoa!!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,"Our family is moving at the end of May. For the past two weeks my husband has been trying to contact the Rainbow location and left 2 messages regarding cancelation. Finally someone answered on Monday afternoon and advised him that he could simply walk in during the hours of operation and complete a cancelation form.   Tonight at 7:15 p.m. my husband walked into the Rainbow location and spoke with the front desk clerk Natasha. Natasha advised him that class would be finishing in 15 minutes at 7:30 p.m. She instructed him that he needed the assistant manager to sign the form. Alright  that seemed like a reasonable request.   At 7:30 p.m. the assistant manager came off the floor and acknowledged my husband. She stated that he would have to wait because she had a client that needed to be enrolled. My husband  myself and our 3 year old daughter waited patiently on the benches provided. ILoveKickboxing does not have offices  it is an open concept gym and we observed the assistant manager explaining the program  giving a tutorial of where items were located and finished the transaction by getting the membership fees upfront and giving the new client a membership card. This took until 8:35 p.m.  My husband having waited a total of 1 1/2 hours communicated his dissatisfaction with the protracted delay involved with canceling his membership. The assistant manager took great pains in dejectedly writing out the cancelation form.   As my husband casually stated he would be happy once this ordeal was through she tempestuously raised her voice refusing his cancelation until he gave her some respect. After she demanded respect which was farcical at best when she forcibly threw the cancelation notice and the pen which she was writing with over the desk and onto the floor. Her tone and demeanor were distressing to our 3 year old.  At this point I was fatigued at the mere thought of staying any longer. I reiterated the fact that we had already waited over an hour and a half to cancel the membership. She queried my husband as to whether his account was delinquent  which it was not. He had set his account up on auto draft.   When my husband made it clear that he would not be leaving until his cancelation was completed she told Natasha to pick up the form that was thrown behind the front desk. My husband ultimately signed it and he asked if there was anything left to do which she replied  ""Walk out the door.""   This is a summation of what occurred to my husband as a customer and a testament to the level of customer service that was not provided by ILoveKickboxing."
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I love this location. This is a great place to start or continue your weightloss journey. The instructors make it very encouraging and i love the loud music.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,My first yelp review ever! I rarely take the time to write such things. For starters  I drive across town to attend classes there but it's well worth it. The facility is very clean and well run. The instructors are motivating and encouraging on a very personal level. They know and remember your name from the first class which is amazing since there are quite a few people in class.   The workout itself is nonstop but fun. I could barely drive home after my first class but I was hooked. I have so much more energy than ever before. To those who may hesitate thinking that they might feel intimidated or feel that they might not be able to keep up  I highly recommend that you give it a try. You work at your own level which is still one great workout.  I am 45 years old and have had a spinal fusion. After a month of attending my back has never felt better. The core strengthening has been the best thing I could have done for my back.
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I recently decided to get out of the regular gym rut and try kickboxing. So I got a Groupon deal and the first day was not what I expected. What I mean by that is  I didn't think I would struggle to make it thru class. It really opened my eyes to how out of shape I've gotten. Ulises was the very first person that helped me learn the techniques. He is patient and highly energetic.  I must say it is a very intense workout. I love that each class has different exercises and warm ups  which for someone like me who is worried about plateauing is a huge benefit. Although  I struggled thru my first couple of classes and had my body ache for days  I am motivated by the staff here. They are such a great spirited  fun loving  hard working bunch. If you want to stop feeling like a number and get encouragement and motivation on a daily workout this is the place to go. I have never felt so great before  during or after a workout. They treat you like family and keep pushing you every step of the way to reach your fitness goals. I'm stoked to have found this deal thru Groupon  so much so I have cancelled my gym membership elsewhere and have signed up for ilovekickboxing as a member! I would definitely recommend this to everyone who is eager to reach their fitness goals in a fast paced way with a highly qualified staff!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,By far the best workout group I have been a part of! I signed up for a gym membership almost two years ago and just never went. I dreaded working out by myself and just didn't have any motivation to go. A friend started going to ILKB a few months back and got me to try it out. I fell in love the very first day I went. Not only was it a great workout  it was also an encouraging environment. The trainers are super supportive and coach you through the entire workout. I could never stick with any type of workout plan but with ILKB I am going twice a week and I look forward to doing it. I highly recommend giving this place a try!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,I purchased a group on months ago with friends to this place . It took me so long to finally make an appt to go in and redeem it. Literally  I got in a few days before it expired . Which turned out to be amazing because I was lucky enough to get Tommy as my instructor for the first class I ended. Not only was he super friendly but what I respected the most was how genuine he was. I don't do well being up sold or dealing with any smoke screens. Tommy was very low pressure when it came to the sales side of things but just be prepared it is a part of the process but it comes at the end. When I first got the tour I also got shown how the essentials work. Tommy was really patient and kept the work out high intensity without coming off too strong.   Essentially the warm up was the hardest part after that it just got more fun!!!!  This place isn't cheap but neither is a personal trainer . The thing I loved most was getting to meet other classmates and aligning on our desire to take back our fitness. There were people of all shapes and sizes and fitness levels . It was tons of fun!!!! If you have trouble sticking with the gym this may be your ticket!!!
Active Life;Boxing;Health & Medical;Boot Camps;Fitness & Instruction;Weight Loss Centers;Trainers;Gyms,All inclusive gyms have rarely kept my interest. Too many people  machines  and  quite frankly  I have no idea what I'm doing. I joined I Love Kickboxing to be challenged and get in great shape. I feel better every morning  I have more energy  and have made friends with the instructors. I highly recommend this gym to get fit physically and mentally.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"My family and I came here for a birthday dinner. We brought the kiddos  there were 4 toddlers with us  the rest all adults. The hostess had informed us twice before entering ""you do know this is a steakhouse  right?"" After that I already had mixed feelings about how our experience would go. And to my surprise  ha! - I was right. It was not how we had expected the night to end! Our service was very bad. And not to mention our food  it was to be completely honest  boring at the very least. There was no presentation in our entrees which all were pricey. You'd expect it to be dressed up nicely on their plates  but no you won't get that here. This restaurant lacked culture and customer service. When I dine at a steakhouse  that's what I would expect from their end  to get an above and beyond experience. So no  I definitely will not be coming back here in the future. If you're happy with all things 'ordinary' then I suppose this is the place for you!"
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Celebrated our wedding anniversary here last night and had a delicious meal. Steaks were tender and juicy.  Service was outstanding.  Thank you for making our meal one to remember!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Love it here. Great place for a date and yummy steaks. If you want a nice date night then go gambling at a local spot  this is the place!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"Best Rib Eye Steak I've ever had  and I mean ever!! I'm not even sure what they do to it  and I really don't care. Allow me to digress for a moment: My best friend and I drove up to Boulder Station to see UFO at The Railhead (huge fans for 35 years).We arrived a day early and felt like having a really good steak dinner and we were about to venture out of the hotel when several people told us about The Broiler. ""It's right downstairs  pass the slots  make a right and it's in the corner""   We find it no problem and walk in  they meet us  greet us and seat us  we look around  wow  what a blast from the past  this place is cool  an old school steakhouse vibe. Everyone was very nice. We both order ""The Delmonico"". Now  understand  my friend of 35 years is not only a food critic  but he does all of the cooking in his family and can sometimes be hard to please. When our plates arrived  it was love at first sight  they were very well presented  the smell was carnivore heaven. They did some buttery  crispy thing on the outside and perfectly tender and melt in your mouth thing on the inside. This was recommended by our waitress and it was their priciest piece of meat  I think we paid $60.00 each but would've paid more. If you ever get the opportunity  tell them Handsome Joe sent you.  PS: UFO kicked ass!!!!"
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Very good food here. I had the bone-in filet and it was cooked to perfection.  Hands down  this place has great food.  I also have to comment on the service.  I don't recall our servers name but he was outstanding. I'd like to thank the Broiler  the service and Boulder Station for a great evening!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,A great steakhouse. Service is always impeccable  a killer bone-in ribeye  and a wonderful salad/soup bar (that is included with your meal). Honestly? You don't really need a starch to accomany your slab o'meat  the salad/soup bar will suffice; along with the yummy bread basket of course. I've never had a sub-par meal here; and in fact  the family has started to include the Broiler as part of any celebratory meal. Good times  really good food.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Another fantastic meal at the Broiler.  Nicole at the hostess desk is always polite and professional.  We always request Steven as our waiter  he is the best.  He is very friendly and attentive to our special order requests.  Our food is always delicious and comes exactly the way we ordered it.  We travel from Summerlin a few times a month to eat at the Broiler because our food and service are always exceptional.  We are looking forward to our next visit.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Best service in town. Jude is the epitome of who server should be. Personable and knows her guest. Always treat us like family. And the food always speaks for itself. One of my faves in Las vegas.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,The friendliest staff I have encountered almost as if they were my family. The prices were reasonable and the prime rib is the best.  I love the crab cakes  bacon wrapped  shrimp for my appetizer . My sides I favor the spinach   asparagus   or sweet potato.  Wine knowledge  and selection pairs perfectly. Compliments to the chef and bonus to staff. Manager is a charming fella I might add.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Excellent food and service.  Same ownership as Green Valley Ranch (Hank's) and Sunset Station (Sonoma Wine Cellar) I have been to Hank's and Sonoma and neither can hold a candle to the food or service delivered at The broiler.  Salad bar is always being refreshed with good salads and always has 2 different soups.  I always ask for a server named Kathy  as she is fabulous  but the others are very good and all have been employed in this position for some time.  Area while not the best  you have no issues parking in the parking lot and walking in as security is always present.  If you want a great meal at off-strip prices  but with great service and food  this is the place to go.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Came here for dinner on Monday evening around 5:45 PM for a reservation for 10 people.  We were seated in a private room  which was very nice because my cousin knows a few of the people who works there.  They have a salad bar up front so you can pick and choose what you want from there once you place your order at the table.  I went and got some olives and sliced cucumbers so I looked like I had some kind of vegetables on my plate.  Although  I did sprinkle bacon all over my veggies  so I'm not sure if they would still be considered as veggies by that time.  For starters  I ordered the crab cakes because I enjoyed the ones we had at Grand Lux Cafe so much  but we came to find out that it wasn't even close in comparison so we were pretty disappointed.  I ordered the queen's prime rib which is a 12oz  instead of the king which is a 16oz steak.  I asked to have my steak cooked medium rare  which it was.  The prime rib was well prepared and tasted much better compared to the crab cakes.  Auntie Bev had the 6 piece oysters on half shell as her appetizer and an order of oyster rockefeller as her entree.  I am not an oyster fan so I told her I didn't want to try them.  She said she preferred the raw ones over the rockefeller because the rockefeller  ones weren't too tasty.  Auntie Ann ordered the escargots as her appetizer.  I tried a piece and it was quite salty.  Although  I've never had it anywhere else before so I don't have anything to compare it with.  She had the crab legs as her dinner and she seemed to kind of enjoy it  but I had too much to eat already so I told her I wouldn't have any.  Everyone else seemed ok with their meals  I guess.  We decided to order the creme brulee for dessert.  Auntie Ann finished one to herself  while Auntie Bev and I shared one.  I guess we were all in the creme brulee mood this trip.  Their creme brulee was probably the best thing from our meal.  Honestly  since Vegas offers so many choices when it comes to fine dining  I wouldn't make my way out here for the food.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"I actually had low expectations for this place since it's all off strip  and I usually think steakhouse on the strip are good  but this one is actually pretty good! Pros: -Excellent Salad Bar! -Excellent Service! -EXCEELLLENT FOOD! Cons: -Pricey in some areas -Service might take a while -Food takes time to get prepared I ordered the Surf and Turf  and even though I waited  I still got to eat because there's the salad bar! The Salad Bar was decent  it had salad  it had soup  it worked as an appetizer. When I got the Surf and Turf  it was the best! I tried the steak and it was cooked to perfection! The Lobster was really filling  it was just delicious! Then they asked if I wanted dessert  ""What do you have?"" I asked. Then they bring me a cart full of all the desserts they had. ""WHOA"" I said  well since I was eating with a group  we just got everything! It was delicious  pretty exquisite  perfect! When I left  I just had a bunch of To-Go Boxes. It was so good  we had to get a bunch to-go! This place is really good  and I recommend you eat here!"
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"I have been to the Broiler off and on over the past few years.  My meals have ranged from good to really good.  The way I eat has also changed quite a bit over those years.  From eating like a fat kid to eating clean and restricted.  This place gives you the opportunity to do both.  The salad bar has been touted as being the best on the Boulder Strip (not sure if that says a lot) and the prices are comparable to the other steak houses in the area.  So  to start off my review: I'll give you the reason we came here this night.  I have family in town for the Easter / Spring Break and in ""celebration"" we went out to dinner.  We  as most families are  never can agree on where to go and what to eat.  So  when all else fails  a steak house is the most agreeable place to go.    *Side note:  This is my 3rd steak house that I have been to in the last 3 weeks and earned me the MEATHEAD BADGE here on Yelp!  And  as I have stated in previous reviews  we eat early.  Our reservations were made for 5:30 P.M. on Saturday  March 24th.  And  per our family  we show up at 5 pm.  **2nd side note: In my family if you're 15 minutes early  you are actually 15 minutes late.  - We meet my family in the restaurants waiting area.  Where we are immediately seated at a nice spacious table.  Plenty of room for the 7 of us.  The table was set up very nice and the atmosphere was pleasant as well.  It was lit well but still had an ambiance that you could have a romantic dinner here  if the occasion ever came.  - As we were checking out the menu  and after our drink order was taken  we were feasting on the complimentary bread.  The best pretzel bread ever  by the way.   - The majority of our table went with the $25 special they had going.  You could choose: prime rib  filet  chicken or salmon  which comes with a side of green beans.  It also gives you access to the A.Y.C.E. salad / soup bar and a dessert (either a piece of Lemon Cake or Chocolate cake).  - We took advantage of the salad / soup bar.  The chicken gumbo was great.  A little too spicy for some but perfect for me.    - The meal came out shortly.  I can only comment on the Prime Rib.  It was a little tough and had some cartilage issues.  But  it was still cooked to order and edible.  I wasn't a huge fan of the green beans but that is par for me.   - Dessert soon followed and the presentation was awesome.  I wanted to take a picture but I got a little too gun-ho and just jumped into it.  But  take my word  it was presented well and it tasted even better.  The dessert took the experience from 3 stars to 4 stars for me.  And  our waiter... John P. (I think that is his name... if not  I'll look at the receipt later and edit) was awesome as well.  He knew his stuff and was patient for those of us who are a little picky.  He was able to answer questions and was very witty.  He wasn't over the top  as some waiters can be.  So  he added to my 4 star rating as well."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Excellent Steakhouse at this price point.  All of our steaks were cooked to perfection and well seasoned.  At first I thought a salad bar in a steakhouse was a bit odd.  However the salad bar is very fresh and had some great items.  I really liked it.  All of the steaks were priced $20-$30 and sides were only $3.  All meals include the soup and salad bar.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Host & Server Carlos IS The Man! He is naturally charming and superb with customer service. You MY Friend are greatly appreciated!  Carlos deserves the full 5 stars along with the decor and ambiance of The Broiler.    The food was perfect once they corrected the overdone filet mignon and lobster tail.  Initially I requested medium-rare for the filet and it was well done. My lobster tail was also well done. How do you do an injustice like that to both items.  Anyways  they cooked it excellently the second time.  We will be back for sure as long as Carlos is working there! :)
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,We went for a late valentine's day dinner (this review is a month or so late  hey  I tend to procrastinate obviously). We were told to sit in Jude's section by a friend and boy  she did not disappoint! She was very sweet and very attentive. Tip: get the king crab legs. Do it.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This is a really nice and cozy dimly lit place..  Kind of surprising for Boulder Station...  The crab cake appetizer was very good and the free salad bar with soups and fruit was a nice touch with the entree...  I do admit  it is kind of strange to have a salad bar in a nice restaurant though.  The only big disappointment was the main course.  My filet that I ordered medium came out more well done and was charred.  Maybe do what another reviewer says and order it one level below what you actually want.  I suffered through and ate it  but I would not do it again.  I should have sent it back for sure and will if I ever go there again!  If I could make another recommendation I would say go to Sonoma Cellar at Sunset Station.  The filet there was absolutely magnificent and the prices are just a few dollars more.  No free salad bar at Sonoma Cellar but the salad bar at the Broiler was not worth the horrible filet.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"I've learned my lesson before not to go to many restaurants in station casinos. I was starving and somewhat desperate so I decided to try ""The Broiler""  one of the biggest mistakes of my life. We first have to wait 20 minutes to be seated (not too bad)  but once we actually get to our take it took our waiter 10 minutes to even greet us and 15 more minutes to bring us our beverages. Finally when we got around to ordering I decided to get the porterhouse steak and the lobster Mac and cheese. I specifically ordered it to be crusted with blue cheese and cooked blue(under raw) with two different sauces on the side. I also got the salad bar which it was nothing special. The soup tasted like something from a soup can. So as I'm eating my soup and salad  my mac and cheese comes out shortly after....I'm eating and still waiting for my steak assuming it was coming soon since I wanted it served with my mac and cheese.  50 minutes later my steak is still not in my belly  nor on my table...so I flagged down the waiter which didn't even come near our table for at least 20 minutes. Once I told him how long we've been waiting her rushed to the kitchen. Brought me out a luke warm medium rare steak with no blue cheese and no sauces. This was seriously the worst service and experience I've ever had at a steak house. I would rather lick up roadkill off the street before stepping foot into this restaurant again."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Perhaps we should have known better than to go to a steakhouse for Thanksgiving dinner  but the advertising for the Thanksgiving dinner sounded good  so this is where we ended up with a son and two granddaughters. The Thanksgiving dinner was set--no substitutions. It included the salad and soup bar  which was nothing special but okay. The choice of entree was turkey or prime rib--4 of us chose turkey--and the vegetables regardless of entree were (yuck) Brussel sprouts and a sweet potato dish with burnt marshmallows on top. What chef would choose to serve Brussel sprouts without allowing a substitution--like maybe peas?  No dessert was included in the dinner price. The fact we were willing to pay extra to satisfy our taste buds which were yammering for pumpkin pie did not matter--there was no pumpkin pie--or even mince--available. What chef would plan a Thanksgiving dinner without pumpkin pie? Next year  we will go somewhere else.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I haven't been here for many many years and decided to come here yesterday. We both had escargot for an appetizer which was made really well  and I had the filet with a side order of scallops  my mom had the sea bass.  I can't even begin to tell you the phenomenal cook on the filet  the scallops were so buttery I didn't need a knife to cut them.  My mom's sea bass was flaking off with her fork.  We sat in Stephen's section and had a couple visits from Kenneth the manager just to make sure everything was to our liking.  I can't say enough wonderful things about this meal  one thing I will say is the bearnaise sauce that I got with my filet... I would put that on anything  it was THAT good.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,We decided to try something different as we have been to the Steak House at Sunset Station and had a great experience.  This is a place I would not return to.  The service was VERY VERY Slow  almost like the servers did not care and knew the food was below average.  Everyone other then the host spent a lot of time in the back instead of on the floor with customers.    My wife ordered a vegetable which came with a Hollindase sauce.  The sauce was very bland and when we finally got our waiter to come back by our table  he took the sauce back and agreed it was very bland.  This is the way all the food was this night  no excitement or care put into the food at all.  It was almost like they were just going through the motions because they were still open but really had no desire to excel.  This is a place we will NEVER go back to or recommend to anyone.  Don't like saying this about a place  it has to be said.  Sunset Station has a much nicer place  service and they really care about the food at Sunset.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I went here earlier tonight and had a really nice experience. Great atmosphere  very attentive service  awesome salad bar and soups included with entre. The manager Kenneth made us feel very welcomed by checking on us multiple times along with our great waiter. Thanks a lot guys! And OMG the food was AMAZING!!! We order bacon wrapped shrimp with filet mignon which were so tasty. They put out quality food here. Best filet mignon I have ever had. Melted in my mouth like butter. They use their homemade marinade. I highly suggest this resturant at the Boulder station. Enjoy!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This has been a tradition now for the past 3 years to bring my Grandfather here for Christmas dinner. We have for the most part enjoyed our experiences. This time it just was not the best experience. We had a reservation at 5:15  yet was still not seated until 6:15. I understand getting busy  but this tells me that you don't have enough staff  or did a poor reservation schedule you could not handle. Either way  it's not ok.  We also had some issue with the food which they corrected.  Our waitress was super nice and apologetic...her name was Jude. She informed her manager of our issues with food and wait time.  The manager Jim was also apologetic and did try to make up for the problems by comping a potion of our meal.  If it was not for the manager acknowledging our inconvenience and our great waitress  I would not have returned.  I would give them another chance next Christmas  but I will make a 4pm reservation to ensure we are seated first. :)
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Not bad  but over priced for Boulder Highway. Go to the steak house at Arizona Charlies instead.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This is a little hidden treasure!! The food is great!! The prices are great!! Our server Jude is beyond awesome!! They are lucky to have her!! You can tell she enjoys her job and is very knowledgeable about wine and pairings!!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This well kept secret in the not-so-good neighborhood is outstanding ( Boulder Station Casino)!  Service ( Steven) was on point ( they don't make waiters like him anymore- we really appreciated his skill)..........food was fabulous.........salad bar was INCREDIBLE!  What a great Date Night this was..........best since we moved here 2+ years ago!  It is a must-go to for all locals! And we even won some money on the fun slots they have there! Worth the drive and even the crazy street people! We'll be back  that is a sure bet!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I came here solo because I had some free time and a gift card for station's. The waiter was named Kenny and he was pretty good except for the fact expressions tells all. He seemed a little weird about my ticket price. The busser Luis was on point.  I had the escargot and I really enjoyed the presentation and the sauce was awesome. For a entree I had the seafood combo. I was kinda disappointed that it was all deep fried. Guess I expected more from a steakhouse aa far as preparation.  The creme brulee was amazing. I am a huge fan of the dessert.  I guess I expected more since I myself work in a Vegas steakhouse. Almost there just need a little something extra in the food and service. I might come back depending on the situation.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Unbelievable. Salad bar not bad but waiter was clueless. My friends scallops were uncooked and three of us who ordered Halibut got Sea Bass which wasn't on the menu. We sent it back. They adjusted bill accordingly.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Went here for dinner last night.We had the salad bar.Excellent 4 stars We split a ribeye outstanding  5 stars Service could have been a lot better.Once our server Kenny saw that we had a coupon his whole demeanor changed.Never told us the specials.Threw the ribeye on the table and took off before we could ask him for anything else and never came back to see how the food was.We usually tip 20% or more his loss.2 stars. We  would go back but hopefully we  get a better server.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Been coming to this location to this restaurant for many of years and always sit in Kenny's section. We celebrate holidays  birthdays & anniversaries. My family & I   have never ever had bad service or a bad meal. Mya steak has always been cook to perfection. The salad bar is just perfect! We continue coming because everybody treat you like family when you walk in.  Thank you to all the staff at the broiler!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This is the second time I have dined here in 4 weeks. It is GREAT !! The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and tender as all get out  my husband had Porterhouse and it was super. We tried a few appetizers  the shrimp cocktail is great (huge shrimp & fresh) The lobster Bisque was not so great (but that's just my taste   as my fiance gobbled it up). The salad bar is wonderful  very large variety of items and nice soups. One could fill up on just the salad bar & a appetizer !! The service is great as well. I will be going here regularly for sure. They also have a special of 4 different entrees plus soup&salad bar for 24.99... I am going to try that next visit. I love this place !!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,This place is so good. What to get when you go to a steak house? hmm! Well a steak plus the salad bar here is amazing and everything here is extremely fresh and the prices are extremely reasonable. Per person average price is $15-30 and could go up or down depending on what you order. This is possibly the biggest secret and surprise that you could find in the Vegas valley.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I stopped by here last week to check out Boulder Station  because well  it's one of the last Station Casinos I had yet to frequent.  Thursday night with no reservation I walked right up and was seated without a problem.  I went straight to the drink menu  skipped over the wines and ordered an aptly named Asian Persuasion martini.  It was wonderfully sweet.  I ordered the filet mignon  butterflied  medium.  It was to die for  to me the perfectly cooked steak.  It wasn't burnt on the outside and it was juicy and tender on the inside.  I unapologetically enjoyed every bite of it.  I didn't order any sides seeing that I was alone and I know they came family style.  However  if you order an entree here you can have the soup and salad bar  so for me  that was a better option.  I didn't get a salad but it looked well taken care of  instead I opted for a delicious cup of split pea soup.  Now I'm not a soup expert but I love split pea and this to me was very good.  It had huge chunks of ham in it and it was very thick.  They also gave me the traditional station bread basket.    I can't tell you about their desserts because I was already pushing myself to finish the steak  but I can say that I will return to eat here again.  The service was good from the hostess that greeted me to the manager that came by to say hello.  I really did enjoy my meal.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,By far one of the best meal experiences in my life. Like the food and our server Jude so much we went back a secind night. It would be my staple hangout if I lived in the region. Simply perfect! Prices were more than reasonable. Will be there again a few times next year when I come back. Request Jude as your server. You will not be sorry. Best server EVER!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,One of the best steakhouses in Vegas you won't be going in for the salad bar but when you leave that will be one of the things that you will definitely remember if you can ask for Kathy she will steer you in the right direction for that night you have a great time.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I've eaten here a number of times  we've been there often for Thanksgiven Dinner and it's always good.  The food is always cooked to perfection and the service is outstanding.  What makes this place good is the salad bar  everything is fresh and fulling.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Great place and service. I was there back in September with my wife and her uncle for her birthday and I had a broken hand. I ordered the steak and the waiter (Ken) took my plate and cut up the steak for me for my convenience even though I didn't ask for it. The place was great and I would go there again.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,We have lived in Las Vegas for 30 years and been eating a couple of times per week at restaurants all over town and by far the Broiler at Boulder Station is our favorite restaurant. The staff is always friendly the food is always magnificently prepared the soups are homemade the dressings are homemade and it's very reasonable. The salad bar is fresh and well maintained. Could not have a higher recommendation.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,The Broiler is located inside Boulder Station Hotel & Casino.  My favorite inexpensive steakhouse in Vegas. It's on the opposite side of town but totally worth the drive.  They start you out with a basket of fresh baked breads. Save me one of the fresh soft baked pretzels!!!  Recommended entrees: Filet Mignon  King Crab Legs  Lobster Tail  Panko Crusted Shrimp. (You can order a filet then add any of the other items at a reasonable price.) Dinners include one family style side dish from at least a dozen choices. The baked potato is huge. Their creamed spinach is delicious. The sauteed mushrooms are heavenly.  The soup and salad bar has Just about anything you could imagine or want on a salad bar is there. Love the chilled asparagus. The tuna salad is tasty. Just don't fill up on the salad bar because there's a great meal coming!!!  Service is always outstanding. The staff is professional and attentive.  Looking forward to my next trip to Vegas for a stop at The Broiler.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Went down to Boulder Station to catch Little Feat in concert.  It was an incredible show and ended at the perfect time to grab a nice late evening dinner on a Friday night.  My husband and I noticed The Broiler  checked out the menu and got a table with no problem at 9:30pm.  Service was superb.  The hostess was a very sweet woman who greeted us with a bright  interested smile  held the door for us  showed us the salad bar  and seated us in a cozy booth as we had requested.  The bus boy was one of the best assistants I have seen.  Always present without stalking us  clearing things away seconds after we finished with them  and having carry out bags ready to go  eager to put our leftovers in the stack of containers he brought for us.  The waitress was one of those women who could really maintain control of her responsibilities while being pleasant and inviting.  She genuinely seemed happy to see us  just like every staff member we encountered at The Broiler.  Service was quick  ultra-efficient  and super friendly.  Ambience was calm and relaxing.  I chose the shrimp dinner and the waitress offered various ways for preparation: Panko  battered  or broiled.  I went with Panko (fried in breadcrumbs).  Excellent choice. $25  My husband picked the swordfish.  Also offered several preparation options  he chose blackened.  He loved it. $30  But the biggest surprise of the night was the incredible soup and salad bar.  This was actually included with our low priced entrees!  We each took a huge helping of the  New England Clam Chowder with those cute little hexagon crackers and then created our own salads of iceberg lettuce salad with bleu cheese crumbles and dressing  tomatoes  hard-boiled eggs  croutons....they had so many toppings.  It was fantastic.  I then tried another salad they had up there: broccoli and chicken in a light cream sauce.  It was unreal.  I literally could have just eaten this all night and I would have been satisfied.  This broccoli and chicken salad was a dinner starter for me but I can't help but think it would also make for a refreshing summer lunch.  The selection of breads were also delicious.  We really liked the warm pretzel bread.  Sodas were crisp.  Espressos were perfect.  Perhaps we have been eating on The Strip too much.  The Broiler was a really nice find with a hometown feel and an affordably-priced menu.  We will definitely visit again.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I used to love coming here. But the service quality has certainly gone down. Judy is the only server I recommend. The other employees seem bitter and gloomy. The hostess is very friendly. Food is delicious. But you'd have a better time in the Pasta Cucina next door :) mostly the same stuff  cheaper prices. However  money is not the issue. It is the service I care about  and this steakhouse lacks it in recent years.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Very good  not impressed with French onion soup the rest was awesome. My wife and I Had oyster Rockefeller  escargot  French onion soup  Chilean sea bass with purple Peruvian mashed potatoes with broccolette and carrots. And pan seared halibut.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I was really wanting their crab cakes but after waiting 15 minutes at the table and not a word being said to me take a drink order or anything I got up and walked out. This like all other things station need to lose their customers and close!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,I've been here twice and I will definitely come back!  I love their raw oysters & filet mignon. Their desserts are also very delish!! Not only are their food great  they also have superb customer service.  Jude was an amazing server and their overall crew rocks. :) Love loveee this place!!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"It may not be in a trendy new casino or have a one hit wonder ""celebrity chef's"" name attached to it but what really matters to me is food quality and service.  You get both here in equal quantities at The Broiler located within the Boulder Station casino.  Want a nice steak that is actually prepared to the proper temperature without breaking the bank?  You've come to the right place. This is an old school style steak house...dimly lit and dark red leather booths; no flash  no fuss  no douche bag DJ playing lame tunes from his iPod so loud you can't hear the people at your table.  What you do get is great service and a very nice meal.  For 32 bucks you can get a steak filet oscar style; and that comes with a very nice soup/salad bar.  The salad bar is always fresh and the plates are chilled.  Wine prices are respectable and won't hurt your bottom line either.  In a city where everyone thinks you must pay $$$$ and be at the trendy spots to have a nice steak this is a refreshing break.  Good food  steaks seasoned and prepared properly  great service.  As far as steak houses go this place is a win."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Was very happy with the food  everything you would expect from a steakhouse except for the outrageous prices. Definitely more inexpensive than a restaurant on the strip  the main trade off being the atmosphere is less formal and its in a local casino. If fancy isn't a requirement then this is a great choice. We had filet  lobster  and scallops  all of which were delicious. The soup and salad bar was a nice addition (included with all entrees) and the tomato bisque soup was exceptional. Dessert was a chocolate lava cake which was rich and perfect to share. Overall it was a great experience.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Going to the broiler for 4 years now and still loving it. the prime rib soup is awesome highly recommend. Kathy and urial server and co server in Las Vegas. I like the seafood platter for under 30 bucks and my wife gets the New York steak for under 30 bucks and we share and let's call it surf and turf. Still the best value in Las Vegas.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Every casino has some sort of attempt at a classy steakhouse- this is Boulder Station's. It's not bad for what it is  with a decent selection of steaks and seafood. Prices are low  quality is higher than the pricing leads you to expect  and the service is on par with a non-casino steakhouse (in other words  good).  There are quite a few apps to pick from- the escargot is my recommendation  but the scallops are good too. Interestingly  they have a large soup and salad bar as the main focal point of the dining room  and it's free with most of the featured entrees (or $14 a la carte)- lots of fresh veggies to pick from  two soups  and it's unlimited.  The prime rib is a popular entree here  order early or be prepared to settle for medium. If you're a rare-or-nothing kind of person  the porterhouse is a good backup. Just don't gnaw on the bone like a caveman.  TIP: If you have the BS players card  you will get quarterly coupons via mail for $20 credit here ($40 minimum)!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"As the first Yelper stated great steakhouse!   Cozy  dim lighted atmo.   The variety of fresh baked bread includes a rosemary sourdough  raisin bread (not my fav.) and a Deelish soft fresh fat warm yummy pretzel (accompanied with unsalted butter).    Wine menu is offered ( and passed up). Dinner menu has about a dozen entrees  the entree includes on side and the buffet soup & salad bar.  I decided on the Porter house Pork Chop ($25) with Mashed potato as my side and my hubby picked the Seafood combo platter($28) and side of French fries. each additional side if $5. But it's really not nessasary.  after our friendly server took our order I went to check out the salad bar.  WOW  was I impressed! started off with the regular Iceberg  then a Garden Mix  followed by a Creamy Dill Shrimp salad  Deelish and colorful Crab Salad  Also Plain but tasty Tuna Salad. Just as you pass down a ways  the nicely diced and pretty shredded veggies that make your build-it-yourself salad look oh so gourmet.  Salad Buffet concluded with a Minestrone soup and my FAVORITE Creamy Asparagus and Crab soup. SOOO GOOOD (chunks of realllly yummy crab mmmm)  Ok  so our Pork shop was HUGE  smashed potato's were real and yummy.... My husbands seafood platter was disappointingly all fried but he did chose to substitute the oysters and scallops for more Orange Roughy and HUGE shrimp.   ""First time I've ever been full off shrimp"" is what my meat and potato man said to me.   I'm sure we will be back  although this kind of restaurant is a treat for us Parents on a budget. (we were on a date night just FYI)  Our dinner was about $62.00 including tip but we did not splurge. The Surf & Turf was a bit steep at $63. and Lobster tail about $48.  But I bet it's awesome."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Fabulous fish!! My father & I are on a road trip back home to Oregon. Due to my terminal cancer I have a ridiculously difficult diet. Chef Jay went out of his way to accommodate me. He met me in the lobby so chat about my diet to see if their kitchen had the correct food. We found one item that would work but he had to cook it a special way. I had the sea bass on special that night. Best fish I've ever had!!!!! We're seafood snobs coming from Oregon. My dad is a fisherman. It is incredibly difficult to find places I can eat. I always feel horrible about being difficult but they made our night perfect. The best meal I had on my trip. Thank you
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Our family went on the 11th for my mother's birthday  and the service was excellent! The food was really good. I think my favorite was the cream of mushroom soup at the salad bar. The service was prompt and as an added bonus after our meal the staff brought a creme brulee out with Happy Birthday written in chocolate! I'd definitely come back here for another special occasion!
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"Amazing service  delicious food and awesome atmosphere... Our drinks were never empty and we were taken care of at all times... Asked if they gave military discounts and they don't however  they brought us dessert with ""Thank You"" written with chocolate sauce on the plate.. Thank you for a wonderful dinner!"
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"3 of us ordered fresh halibut prepared in different ways: Oscar  pan seared and blackened. The 4th one ordered pan seared scallops. Sent everything back. Scallops were raw and the ""halibut"" wasn't halibut at all...the Chef came out and admitted it was sea bass. Each of the preparations tasted strange. To make it worse  even though we were nice about it our waiter wasn't! Another young server came over to appologise. Not a place I would recommend."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Amazing food and excellent wait staff!   Appetizers we had: Calamari Ahi poke- really good and a bit on the spicy side. But I would really recommend this!  Escargot- too salty for my taste and they put a leaf on it that gave it a bitter taste  I ordered the petite filet mignon and king crab. I couldn't even finish it! The portions are very big and all entrees include an expansive soup and salad bar.   Jude is an amazing server. She was very attentive  helped me pick an entree  and can work magic for you ;)
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,"Have been eating here once a week ever since they brought Chef Jay back to run the restaurant. One of the best chefs I've ever had the priviledge to know. His specials are ""to die for"". The salad bar is one of the best in town. The appetizers are delicious and large enough that I often order them as my entre' along with a side (you must try the roasted corn - just like Mexican street corn without the cobb). My husband loves the blackened salmon and the prime rib. Both Jude (Judy) and Kenny as well as Catherine have taken care of us and they're on the top of their game."
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Had not been to the Broiler for years. We used to make this place a stop for dinner when we were LV tourist. Noticed a commercial for a prime rib special( $14.99) and it jogged our memory and we jogged.....well not exactly.....we drove over for a very nice meal at a great price. We did the 14oz prime rib special that came with their above average salad bar  mashed potatoes  broccoli and a basket of bread. I also had a very nice flight of wines for the bargain price of $10. Overall prices were very reasonable and the sides were only $5. which is a bargain for a LV steakhouse. A terrific restaurant with a nice soft ambience at a decent price. Will def put this place on our steakhouse rotation though it is a jaunt from Summerlin. Def worth the drive.So ono.
Steakhouses;Restaurants;Seafood;Buffets,Fantastic Food.  First let me say that they have an awesome salad bar that is included in the meal.  I ordered the petite filet mignon and it was fantastic.  The portion was larger than the average petite filet mignon and the meat was extremely tender and tasty.  We ordered garlic mashed potatoes that was delicious.  Can't wait to go back.
Nail Salons;Eyelash Service;Hair Removal;Beauty & Spas;Waxing,GREAT EXPERIENCE!  Walked right in with my 50% off flyer  was greeted  and immediately given service. This place is like brand new and the nail polish color options are wonderful. Their licenses are all on the wall to show their certification. Everything is organized and neat.    The lady who did my nails spoke little English  but she was so nice. She took her time and really provided me with great service. I love my nails.  I would definitely return.
Nail Salons;Eyelash Service;Hair Removal;Beauty & Spas;Waxing,Went here because I got a flyer for a discount. the people were so nice and Lee's work was exactly what I asked for. Definitely will be back !!!
Nail Salons;Eyelash Service;Hair Removal;Beauty & Spas;Waxing,Lynn was amazing. Fast & super nice!  Brand new & very relaxing atmosphere Showed her a pic of what I wanted and it came out perfect.

Automotive;Auto Repair,This place is great!!! My family always go to them when we have car problems! They always give reasonable pricing too! I just got a new car but unfortunately got into an accident few weeks after! They took care of me and my care. Couldn't be happier!
Automotive;Auto Repair,Four days to fix a misfire on a Ford? Larry said it was fixed and it wasnt when I drove the next day. Why take it back under warranty? Got it fixed and and could not believe 3 plugs were LOOSE !!  Another time I changed the serp belt. only to find out my ac hose was rubbing on 1 of the pulleys  when i suddenlyt blew out Freon while on a job !!! This shop has completely fallen off and I will never EVER do business at FEDELS again !!
Automotive;Auto Repair,I love Fedels auto care. They take their time on the job and really know what they're talking about.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,For years I wanted to get a breast augmentation but was always terrified...when I finally got the courage to make a consultation I did so with Dr. Richards and im so glad I did!! I didn't hesitate scheduling the procedure that same day because he and his staff made me feel extremely comfortable. It's been a little over a month now and they're absolutely beautiful! He listened to what I wanted and he made sure that's exactly what I got. His work is amazing!! Whenever I have a question his staff is always so helpful and attentive which makes the entire healing process so comforting. I am absolutely in love with the results and thankful to Dr. Richards! He's the best!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I would recommend Dr Richards to everyone. He is kind and compassionate. He really takes his time with you every visit! I went to three other doctors  prior to making my decision. I had breast implants done 16 years ago and one leaked. Dr Richards was the only Doctor that took his time answering my questions and concerns. He came in prior to surgery sat down and we reviewed everything once again. All of his staff are very very kind people. I can't speak highly enough about how I was treated . My breasts turned out beautiful!! Thank you so much Dr Richards!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,So I normally don't do reviews but today is the day that I start my journey on my first surgery which is going to be a BBL for those that don't know a BBL is a Brazilian butt lift augmentation. I had went to an initial consultation at My Shape Lipo earlier and I spoke with one of the surgeons there he was very nice but when I went to Dr Bryson Richards office I was just blown away how great of a doctor he is how he put my mind at ease about the surgery and the procedure how he told me everything that I wanted to hear just to make me feel comfortable to stay in Vegas. I initially had my mind set on going to Miami Florida to have this procedure done but when I got to his office I knew that this was just going to be a right fit for me so I cannot wait to start my journey I will be putting down my deposit to save my date a little later on this month but I am sure that he is going to give me the results that I've been wanting my whole life! Dr Richards just got finished performing the bbl surgery earlier before I met him and I seen the pictures and the girl that he did and she  is going to look so amazing when she's done healing. So Im ready to put my faith in him. Dr Bryson Richards office is very Posh and upscale. And not to mention my coordinator Misty is amazing!!!! (Go Ducks! Lol)  I can't wait to start my progress with this company and I am so ready to begin my new life in 2018 when I get my surgery done. I'm actually going to start a real self page and also maybe a YouTube page too have you guys go with me on my journey if interested! Stay tuned  RichardsDoll 2018
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr Bryson Richards was  truly amazing!  From Dawn guidance and his patience and understanding I knew I chose the right Dr and staff for my surgery.  The process was great.  My results are phenomenal and I'm just 3 weeks out. My recovery has been going so well Im very shocked at how fast I got back on my feet.  The office staff is very  professional  knew me by name right after the first visit.  DAWN is amazing and she makes you feel like you belong!  I have nothing bad to say about  Dr Richards or his staff. His bed side mannaers was just like having family . If you are looking for a awesome surgeon that will listen to you cares and concerns and give you what you asked for  then this is you doctor ! BELIEVE ME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Perfect lips . Thank u dr Richards ! Don the assistant was super calming and sweet . Dr Richards was so gentle with his hands on my lips   made them perfect .
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I recently had a breast augmentation (smooth  round silicone sub pectoral through an inframammary incision) and the results are absolutely amazing!!! Dr. Richards and his staff are extremely professional  accommodating  knowledgeable  and friendly!! I highly recommend Dr. Richards for any and all of your plastic surgery needs!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr Richards & his staff were amazing. I booked this from Hawaii & went off of his reviews & the fact his staff was great  especially Kerry.  It turned out they were as amazing in person as they seemed by emails & reviews. At 6 days post op my tummy is  tight & already beautiful even with the swelling. Not a stretch mark left  stomach is flat already & no bruising. My bellybutton looks like a natural one my scar is low & symmetrical. I asked all my questions & did lots of resesrch & couldn't be happier this was the best decision ever. I came with a list of questions & they answered them all without making me feel uncomfortable.  Having a tummy tuck is huge & can be life changing in both a good way & bad way u have the right to feel you have chosen wisely. This has been life changing in nothing but good ways.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,My first n last consultation for a breast augmentation was set in stone with Dr. Richards. I wanted a natural look and he gAve me just that. I am so very pleased with my results i recommend Dr. Richards to anyone looking into enhancing their beauty. He is skillful and there is absolutely no pressure. He listens to what you want and doesnt even need any of my wish pics because he makes the enhancement just right for your body. Wait time is minimal  staff are friendly  Ms. Dawn his assistant is beautiful and helpful. The evening prior to surgery the anesthesiologist called me with instructions  and On the day of surgery dr. Richards gives you his cell phone number and checked on me that same night.  if you're curious to know how my journey through the BA process went u can find a more thorough review on realself.com under lahh_LV ! Hope it helps!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,AMAZING EXPERIENCE!!!!   seriously if you are looking for a professional  funny & caring surgeon do not look any longer! Bryson Richards is by far the best (I've had other surgeons before).    He snapchatted my surgery which was awesome because I have pics & friends were able to see what I had done.   Ok... then I meet his wife walks in the office & greets me. Makes sure I'm ok & if I have questions.   WOW!!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I had a deflate on one of my saline implants so i came to dr. Richards to re-do my whole breast augmentation with silicon and it came out PERFECT !!! I am sooo happy with the results ! I definately recommend dr. Richards to anyone in need of a breast augmentation he made me so comfortable and everyone in the office has been amazing !
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards and his staff are AMAZING!!!! Dr. Richards didn't breeze through my consultation  he took his time recommended different options  measured  & treated me as if it was already set in stone that I was getting my surgery done (not treating me as if I was just another quick free consultation).  After my surgery he checked on me that night to check on how I was doing. Even after the surgery with my follow up appointments have been great.  My breast already look amazing & they haven't even set yet.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Overall a great experience. Dr Richards is awesome and all of the staff is very helpful and professional. I love my result and definitely recommend Dr Richard's office.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I'm so happy I found Dr. Bryson Richards he's very professional & his work is absolutely amazing. The staff is wonderful as well. I couldn't ask for a better team of people to help me through my journey.   I had lip injections (1 syringe) I'll post a picture. I also had breast done as well. The surgery was so much better than I had expected & they look beautiful! I'm so HAPPY & definitely recommend him to anyone.   I did so much research and it definitely paid off when I found him. The nurses there are so educated   helpful & sweet.   You can really tell they care about you & take the time to listen & understand what you want.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,My wife had a tummy tuck and lypo on the love handles. He was by far the best doctor she has ever had for plastic surgery. The results were more than expected. He is hands down  worth the affordable price and or any wait. I can not give any better recommendation about him or his very caring and friendly staff. Thank you so much!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards was phenomenal in helping me with a medical issue that needed attention right away. He was very professional  thorough  and knowledgeable in his craft. He has an engaging personality with exceptional bed-side manners. He put me at ease with any concerns and questions that I had. Also  his new office is beautiful  clean  and comfortable with state-of-the-art equipment. I am confident in Dr. Richard's skill and trust his medical judgement. I would recommend him to my family and friends.   -Beckie Brooks
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Jessica Thomas 34 and 2 children later also lost over 100 pounds  Dr Richard and his staff is the real deal! He was absolutely thorough  took his time and explained all my options. I ended up getting my tummy tuck on 2/3/2016 and that very night he called to check up on me. He even gives out his cell number so if you have any concerns you can contact him anytime! Its been 2 weeks later and my stomach looks PERFECT! My only complaint is I wish I would of done it sooner. If you are looking for a the best cosmetic Surgeon  Dr Richard is your guy!

Never had a staff that worked so well to make me feel at ease ! Check my Instagram for photos ( domoniqueavery)
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I had a great experience with Dr. Richards and his staff. I felt comfortable from the moment I walked into the office. I went for a consultation on breast augmentation  and I was in and out within an hour  and got a 3D scan of what I will look like  so I was able to see more than just an implant in a bra. I was lucky to get scheduled for just 2 weeks after my consult. The whole staff is wonderful and caring  and I appreciate their overall attitudes towards their clients. I am super happy about the job Dr. Richards did. It's only been 2 weeks  but I think my breast aug looks amazing  and I couldn't have asked for better. Thank you so much!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards just did my breast revision surgery and they are so beautiful! My first saline implants deflated 17 years ago  then I had silicone put in. Here it is 17 years later and they were pretty old and a little uneven. I also breast fed my children. This surgery made my breasts look better than the first one almost 20 years ago! I cannot believe it they are perfect for the first time ever!  My breasts are magazine worthy! Dr. Richards and his entire staff were so wonderful and caring! He is such a gifted surgeon! I can't say enough good things about him!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Best PS in Vegas. Super humble and an artist. I would recommend him to anyone. His staff is also wonderful. Thumbs up!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richard's office and team are warm and welcoming. It is also a comfortable and safe space as every one of his staff helps the process in making you feel the number one priority. The office is great because they actually have an operating room on site. From the front desk  to the nurses  to the anesthesiologist   and then to Dr. Richards  you will not be disappointed. He is knowledgeable and obviously enjoys his job by the way he informs you of all the small details with sizing and medical jargon. You really feel more knowledgeable after going over everything with him. And most importantly  I love my results. He listened to my needs  my daily activities  and helped me make the right decision. The outcome is exactly what I wanted. I would recommend to anyone considering cosmetic work.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I needed eyelid surgery to be done because my left eyelid was drooping down and starting to block my vision.  I researched the surgery and Doctors on-line and I also spoke with people who had the surgery done themselves.  Doctor Richards was highly recommended and my initial consultation with him supported those recommendations.        The surgery was done painlessly and my recovery time was quick.  I'm extremely happy with the way the surgery turned out and I strongly recommend Doctor Richards to anyone thinking of having this procedure done.    Larry Perger
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I needed a breast lift and implant revision. I did a LOT of research before my surgery. I researched extensively online  and I went to 6 consults with doctors in Las Vegas and California. I chose Dr. Richards not only for his skill  but also for his compassion and bed-side manner.        Before surgery  Dr. Richards met with me several times and kindly answered every ridiculous question I could come up with. Most importantly  he listened. He listened to exactly what I wanted and told me honestly about the results I could expect. He was compassionate and made me feel comfortable that he understood exactly what I was looking for.        My surgery took longer than expected; Dr. Richards had to completely reconstruct my pockets and repair stitches a former doctor had placed. He basically re-built my chest from scratch. The results are amazing  even better than I could have expected! The lift completely reshaped my torso and made me look 5 lbs lighter. Dr. Richards's stitching is PHENOMENAL. It's been 2 weeks since surgery and my scars are flat. If someone stands back about 10 feet  my scars are invisible. I was expecting to look like Frankenstein for a year; I am honestly amazed at how fantastic my incisions look. I could not have asked for a better surgeon.        Dr. Richards's staff is wonderful. Everyone is so kind and friendly. They knew me on a first name basis after my first appointment. They're always on time and never make me wait. The surgery center Dr.Richards uses is wonderful  as well. The nurses were so kind and compassionate that I sent them a gift basket after my surgery.        After surgery  Dr. Richards called me the same night to check on me and gave me his cell number in case I had any problems or questions. He made me feel that he was honestly concerned about my well-being.       If you're considering cosmetic surgery  you are doing a disservice to yourself if you don't schedule a consult with Dr. Richards. My friend came with me to my post-op appointment and after just a few minutes in the room with him  she knew she would go to Dr. Richards for her breast augmentation. He's a wonderful doctor  I simply can't say enough good things about him.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,110% patient satisfaction.  Dr. Richards and every single one of the nurses and staff go above and beyond to make you feel comfortable.  They listen to exactly what you want and help you make the best decision.  I couldn't have asked for more.  I am so glad to have found Dr. Richards and his amazing crew.  I am beyond happy with the results of my breast augmentation which was scheduled no more than a week after my initial consultation.  I was initially a 34 A bra size.  I opted for a full D cup in which I got 450cc silicone Mentor memory gel HP implants sub glandular.  I am 28 hours post op and look/feel great.  Absolutely unbeatable.  I would recommend Dr. Richards to anyone seeking plastic surgery.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Great experience. Wonderful doctor. I had two surgeries done by him and multiple injections. Everything went smoothly. I highly recommend dr. Richards.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I have had the best experience with Dr Richards and his staff than I could have ever hoped for. I have always had some kind of body shame and as pregnancies happened and diet and exercise no longer could help allow me to obtain any type of normalcy  I finally made the decision to do something for me. Dr Richards listened to my needs and made them a reality. His bedside manner is beyond compare and his staff is supportive and available to answer any and all questions. Dr Richards is my go to surgeon and is the best person I could have found! Special note to Misty-thank you for your support  you're the best!!!  Thank you Dr Richards & Staff  Kelly C
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I was very excited the day I found Dr. Richards on the popular website Realself.com. All of his reviews were excellent  as well as all of his reviews on Google. I read many of the questions Dr. Richards had answered and spent a lot of time researching him before I decided to go in for a consultation. I am yet to find a negative review regarding Dr. Richards  all of his clients had positive things to say  and I felt it was a good decision to go for the consultation. I was extremely nervous as my case was not the average Breast augmentation. My breast were very different in size and even shape. I was extremely nervous as I didn't know if my problem could even be fixed. During my consultation I initially met with Kerry  she was extremely nice and made me feel comfortable right away. Soon after Dr. Richards came in to the office and met with me to go over what he thought could be done  sizes  etc. I felt comfortable enough with Dr. Richards and his staff to schedule my surgery that same day. The day of surgery I was extremely nervous as I had never had any type of surgery in my life. Dr. Richards made me feel comfortable and assured me I was in good hands. The surgery went very well  and all of the staff involved in the surgery were fantastic. I am now one week post op and couldn't be happier. Dr. Richards was able to fix the difference in size in my breast  and achieve a fantastic overall look. I am still healing but I am extremely excited to see the end result as I know it will only keep improving. I am very thankful for him and for making me feel confident and beautiful. I can't wait for summer to show off my new breast in a bathing suit like I have always wanted to do. Thank you Dr. Richards and all the staff.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I'm so happy I found Dr Richards. I have been wanting to get a few procedures done and thoroughly did my research. After lots of happy clientele and 5 stars across the board  I decided to consult with him. I was very impressed by his knowledge  listening skills and personality. He was great! I wanted to share my story after all my procedures were done. Botox at first followed by implant removal and a chemical peel for my face. I am ecstatic with my results!! He is amazing and passionate about what he does. Who else calls you the day of your surgery on his way home from a long day at the office to check on me? This is what makes him stand out from the rest. He is personal with his patients. I wanted to say that his staff is the same. Very friendly and helpful with lots of smiles. I have not one negative thing to say. Thank you Dr Richards. I love you guys!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards and his staff are awesome! I had a breast augmentation and he gave me exactly what I wanted. I love them!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,After a lot of research I decided to use Dr. Bryson Richards to do my lips... I couldn't be any happier... He's amazing  very professional and his staff is welcoming and very comforting... I totally recommend him if anyone is looking to get juvederm in their lips..
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I had great results! And the staff is very kind and attentive. I shopped around before making the obvious right decision.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I have wanted a breast augmentation for a few years  but was on the fence about it due to the bad publicity breast implants have received in the past.  After having two children and breastfeeding both children  my breasts were non extent.  My girlfriend referred me to Dr. Richards and I am very pleased that she did.  I had done extensive research on line on breast augmentation before I went in for my consultation.  I am runner who trains for marathons and half-marathons throughout the year.  I was very concerned about my size of breasts after surgery.  I did not want my breasts to get in the way when I run.  Therefore  I researched size and type of breast implants.  I had a lengthy list of questions and items for Dr. Richards to cover during my consultation.  He was very patient with me and answered all my questions.  He made me feel more comfortable about getting breast implants. When I explained to him how important running is to me he made sure the breast implants suited my lifestyle.  He also took into consideration the input of my husband.  He has excellent compassion and bed-side manner.    I have had my implants for 3 months and I am thrilled with them.  He is a talented doctor.  I have no regrets about having a breast augmentation done. There is nothing I can say negative about him or his staff.  They are very pleasant to work with.  I will be going back to get other work done in the future.  Thank you Dr. Richards.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I never give 5 stars for plastic surgeons. I am a juvederm connoisseur. Nobody can get the fillers the way I want here in the states. The techniques that are used are rudimentary and not skilled. However  dr Richards used the techniques used by the most well known surgeons in South Korea. Oh did I mention I travel to South Korea to the most prestigious plastic surgeons to get fillers done?  Dr Richards knows what he's doing. He is fast. Not only with the consult but injecting. As well. Quick handed. And he is confident. I will never go to anyone else as long as I'm in Vegas. I did try out VIP plastic surgery with Dr K and was not happy with the results. I truly with all my heart trust dr Richards and his talent. He is amazing. He augmented my lips and my nasal labial folds.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,"I was referred to Dr. Richards by one of my gf's. I liked how natural she looked and she told me how great he was. I immediately booked an appt with him.  Disclosure: This is for the lip fillers experience I had. I had gotten my lips once done before through a different Doctor and I was completely dissatisfied. My right side of my bottom lip was bigger compared to the left side. Plus my bottom lip was larger than the top lip in general and I didn't like it.  When I went to see Dr. Richards he acknowledged my concern and was confident he would be able to fix the issue and help balance out my lips to look more proportional.   I wanted to wait a couple of weeks for the swelling to go down before I left a review. I'm 100% satisfied! My lips look amazing. I've received numerous compliments from friends and peers. My lips look natural but enhanced without being overdone or ""ducky."" I'm so happy I went to Dr. Richards. I've already referred friends and family to go see him. I will definitely continue to visit him in the future."
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I was recently in the market for breast augmentation surgery and I had been researching different practices for quite sometime. As an RN myself I was looking for someone with credentials that met my standards in addition to a price point that wasn't too costly. I was extremely fortunate to have found Dr. Richards' practice. His educational background exceeded my expectations as did his patient testimonials on real self. Additionally  his pricing for a silicone breast augmentation was remarkably affordable especially with regards to the standard of care provided and the results achieved. He and his staff went above and beyond to determine my desired breast size and utilized state of the art technology to help me visualize the projected end result. Their bedside manner was excellent and they were constantly available throughout the entire process had I any questions or concerns. The entire team at Richards Cosmetic Surgery were extremely friendly and their calm demeanor was very reassuring. As a generally very critical customer  I can honestly say I was more than satisfied with my results and I will most definitely be returning to Dr. Richards for any and all of my future procedures.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards and the entire staff are spectacular.  Beautiful  calming offices  nice decor  plenty of parking.  Their front office staff are extremely professional  friendly and very welcoming.  Misty  Dr Richards' nurse  is the most comforting and caring nurse I have ever experienced.  All your questions are answered in your time and aren't given that rushed feeling.  Your procedure is explained in exact detail.  If you are in the market for an exceptional doctor in this field  look no further than Dr. Richards.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards is amazing!!! He is so kind and friendly and he really makes patients feel comfortable. He did Botox on me and I have never been happier with the results of a Botox session and I've been to many providers!!! Everyone in the office has a smile on their face  is genuinely sweet and makes you feel right at home! I would recommend Dr. Richards for ANY and ALL cosmetic procedures that anyone might be getting!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Let me start by saying Dr Richards and his staff are amazing. They are kind  patient  and professional. Made me feel comfortable and confident in my size selection while educating me on all my options in a way I could understand in a timely manner. I love my new look and highly recommend anyone in the Vegas market interested in breast augmentation to go to Dr Richards. Pricing is reasonable with excellent finish product and follow care.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I came to Dr. Richards because my sister was so extremely happy with the Breast Augmentation he had done for her  and needless to say my results were nothing short of the Same:)...What I appreciated most about him is He really Cares about the result he Achieves.. He's not going to sell you the Unrealistic expectation you want  if he feels it will Complicate the overall look. He Sculpts every body individually  which I didn't understand at first  being my first plastic surgery ever  and starting with such a small (A) i am now a full perky (C) ...He makes you feel extremely comfortable and the procedure seemed surprisingly easy. Great Office Staff! His Assistant Don is GREAT.. & Im soo Happy with my new look and new found confidence!  THANK YOU Dr. Richards !!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,"I had THE BEST experience with Dr Richard's and ALL of his staff. I had a breast augmentation (""gummy bear"" implants under the muscle) on Oct 21st and could not be happier with every single step of the way leading up to my suture removal appointment today. I had a cosmetic procedure with another doctor here in town and my experience there was also good but Dr Richard's takes it to another level. His price was significantly lower than other surgeons without sacrificing an ounce of quality. During my free consultation I filled out paperwork and waited 2 minutes to be called into an exam room. I changed into a robe and 2 minutes later I met with my treatment coordinator  Misty  and Dr Richards. He answered my list of questions with just the most pleasant bed-side manner that you could ever hope for in your doctor. Each time I see him he is always as caring and not rushed at all. He really listened to me and made sure I felt like he understood what my goal for my BA was. He asked me questions to assure that we were on the same page. Dr Richards took a 3D image of my body then showed me a before and after 3D image of my torso with the different sized implants I was considering. He emailed them to me so that I could mull over it at home. I would say that the sizers were still the most accurate gauge of how my BA actually ended up looking although I really appreciated the 3D images. That was something that other doctors did not offer. After I spoke with Dr Richards I spent some time with Misty trying on sizers. She will give you a bra and some silicon sizers so that you can get a sense for what size you are interested in so that you can choose. I then went with Misty to her office where we discussed the details like price  surgery days that were available  she thoroughly went over the consent forms with me and went through a surgery booklet with me which I got to take home. It details what to expect before and after  risks  benefits  medications etc. Very informative. I read it twice. I let her know that I was a bit undecided about the size but she really reassured me by letting me know that I can pick multiple sizes that the Doctor will have on hand on the day of my surgery so that  if I don't decide until the last second  the one that I choose will be ready for implantation. I excitedly booked my surgery date for a couple weeks out.  As I awaited the pre-op appointment I thought I had decided on one size but then  of course  became not so sure as the days went by. Misty invited me to come back in for some more time spent with the sizers. I brought a bunch of different shirts to see what size looks like what in different shirt styles. Picking the implant size was certainly the most stressful aspect for me but after that second sizer visit I felt so much more confident in my decision. I took pictures just to remind myself how they were going to look.  On the day of the surgery I was so excited. That was the only time I had to wait to be seen. I arrived on time but the previous surgery before me was about to start so I waited about an hour or so. I didn't mind because I understand how these things go. Can't rush perfection on a medical procedure. Even then Dr Richards still came out to say hello to me personally and to let me know that I was next and he was excited to help me achieve my BA goal. Every single nurse and assistant was so friendly and excited for me. They made me feel very comfortable as they (Trevor and Diane if I remember correctly) placed my IV catheter and took my vitals. Just before surgery Dr Richards came into the room again with the 3 different implants I was considering. We spoke some and I ended up telling him to do whatever he thinks looks best as I know there are so many factors and he is the professional. I wanted good proportion and he gave it to me. I was walked into the surgical suite where I saw the anesthesiologist  Dr Bowman  who had called me the day before to say hello. He is board certified and super friendly and professional. They got me all comfortable on the surgical table and I began to feel SO peaceful and relaxed as they slowly gave me the anesthesia IV drugs. I am sure I went to sleep with a smile on my face. My breasts are looking fabulous and they are EXACTLY what I wanted. I could not be happier. I always loved my body before and was very confident in it but just had always wanted larger more ""womanly"" breasts. Dr Richards and his staff made that dream come true.  After seeing how happy I am and how great my breasts look  I now have 3 friends who already booked their procedures and a couple more considering making a consultation appointment. Go see Dr Richards and staff! You will NOT regret it."
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards was my first and last consultation. I knew right away he was the doctor for me.   Dr. Richards is professional  knowledgeable  thorough  detail-orientated  warm patient and kind. He understood my needs. Never suggested  any additional or unnecessary procedures (which many doctors do). All the qualities I was looking for in my doctor.   Dawn did such an amazing job guiding me through the process. I couldn't thank her enough.   From consultation to post-op my experience was great! He has an amazing office staff  led by Natalie  (Dawn  Misty and Christina are dolls) so friendly efficient  ready to answer any questions you may have. His surgical team is awesome as well making you feel comfortable and at ease during a nerve wrecking time. I love my results and will continue to see Dr. Richards should I need anything in the future.   I should also add my appointments were always on time no waiting (which is appreciated!)   If you're considering cosmetic/ plastic surgery or are on the fence about witch doctor to choose  come see Dr. Richards and his staff they are the best in the business!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr Richards has been amazing  and his staff is wonderful. Everyone makes you feel comfortable. I had a breast augmentation and couldn't be happier with my results and experience I've had so far. I had some weird pains in my left breast after surgery and Dr Richards was amazing he had me come in even with his busy schedule every few days to Keep an eye on me. Right after surgery he personally texts  you to check up on you. If you have any questions or concerns he gives you his personal cell and gets back to you in very timely manner. I would highly recommend seeing him and I am so happy with my new girls.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,A nightmare experience with Dr  Richards. He intentionally bruised my face by squeezing the area he had just injected with his fingers.  Was an hour late; the room was dark  the realtor-nurse smeared my face with the numbing cream like she was icing a cake. When the doctor arrived  the effect of the numbing cream had passed. Dr. Richards injected my face carelessly  with complete disregard to the sensitivity of my skin. On top of it  he left my face black and blue.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,What an amazing doctor ! My surgery went better then imagined result wise   quickly healing and dr Richards gives you his personal number for contact   I will be back for future surgeries more then happy over all.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,He is the sweetest doctor and most understanding about what procedures you want. He has the skills of an angel and the magic eye!!! And now my best facial girl has moved to his amazing office off of hualapai  her name is Lynette!! The staff is great as well!!! Best surgeon ive ever had.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I have to say . What a kind and wonderful staff too. Dawn is amazing and the operating room nurse was so kind. He made sure I was comfy and pain free. Love Dr. Richard and his staff.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I found Dr. Richards thru my sister. I am so happy . I saw a few Dr's and did consultations and never felt comfortable until I had my consultation with Dr. Richards. He's very caring and personable. He listened to what I wanted and also gave me his honest opinion on what size of implant I should get. I let him decide between a 550cc or 500cc high profile  silicone implant. I woke up with 500cc and I couldn't be more happier. People think my breast are real that's how great he is. I would recommend him to anyone. I trust him with my life. He also preformed a TCA peel on my face. Very painful but defiantly worth it. I have a brand new face  brand new breast. I look and feel like a million dollars. I couldn't say enough good things about him. He is on call for you 24/7.  Please anyone considering plastic surgery go see Dr. Richards!!!!! Also Kerry his assistant is the best. She takes very good care of you. Will answer all your questions truthfully and will make your time there as comfortable as possible.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,My consultation was with Dawn  his assistant. Dawn Is Awesome I knew if the doctor was half as caring  kind  and professional as she was that I was in good hands. She talked him up really well and I gotta say she was right. I have not fully healed from my tummy tuck yet as it is a serious surgery  but when I get dressed every morning I cry because I look so good not because I have rolls hanging everywhere LOL. I would recommend this practice any and every day! Thank you Dawn and dr. Richards for being awesome and making me look amazing  ( and being affordable lol)
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I recently had breast enlargement surgery and being nervous and unsure about the procedure or where to go  I contacted Dr Richards office. He had great reviews on yelp  so I went with him. From the first consultation he was informative and put me at ease. When it came to the operation  it was quick and relatively painless. Overall I couldn't be happier with his work and the end result looks amazing! His staff was very professional and knowledgeable. They were very informative with all of my questions and concerns  From pre-op to post-op  they all made it a smooth and comfortable process. Thank you Dr Richards and Staff.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I went to my one moth follow up apt with Dr. Richards  had my pictures taken. My breast look amazing just at one month post op!! I couldn't be happier with the results! I definitely recommend my PS to any one who is looking to get their breast done or redone !! He is amazing. Excellent results
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I had my breast augmentation surgery March 9th. He is the only doctor I felt comfortable with and knew exactly what I wanted. I knew I had come to the right place for my surgery. I went to numerous doctors in Las Vegas among other areas and Dr. Bryson was by far THE BEST. I had one other Dr recommend a breast lift. Dr. Bryson had said no lift needed if i go bigger. I was nervous about the size but I trusted what Dr. Bryson had to say. I had give him details and pictures of what I wanted and he decided on the perfect size for me. I absolutely LOVE my new breasts and I honestly couldn't have been more satisfied inside and out!

Richards as my surgeon. He is so professional and makes you feel so at ease with your surgery!!!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,My wife had to have her implants replaced after being in for so long. We looked all over   many consultations that cost money and were much more expensive than years ago. Dr Richards was best priced  most knowledgeable and most professional. His assistant Misty was amazing to work with as well. Entire staff ran like clock work. Final results  my wife looks amazing !!!The surgery could not gone any better nor the results. She is happy and confident again  Dr Richards recommendations were spot on. Do not miss an opportunity to have this team improve the way you feel about your self .
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I was very happy with my experience.  All the ladies that were at the front desk were welcoming and very friendly.  Dr. Richards was very nice.  I'll definitely go back to him when I need other fillers.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr. Richards is everything one could want in a plastic surgeon.  He's skilled and professional  attentive without being pushy  and his staff is fantastic.  Could not recommend Dr. Richards more highly!
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Had a procedure done back in August.  Dr. Richards makes you feel very comfortable during your consultation.  He also does not pressure you either.   I am very pleased with the results and I have been telling all my friends about him.  I will definitely recommend him to anyone who wants to have or needs to have something done.
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,Dr.Richards was the best choice I could have made! I came from out the state to get my Breast Augmented after researching Plastic Surgeons. The staff was super friendly and it was a beautiful clean location!  I am one month Post Op now and couldn't be happier with my results! My breast dropped during my first week and I healed super fast. My recovery went very well... the toughest part was the first week for a few days but I'd describe it as soreness rather than pain. My scars are still healing at one month (skin color) but they are completely smooth ... I cannot wait to see the final results.   Check Dr.Richards out for a beautiful enhancement for your body
Health & Medical;Doctors;Beauty & Spas;Cosmetic Surgeons;Medical Spas,I was fooled by bunch of fake 5 star reviews for this doctor.   I should start by saying that I purchased a groupon. I don't know if clients without groupon get better care from this doctor  but I was not that lucky.  When I walked in the office  I immediately felt condescending attitude from the blond lady upfront. A strange smirk didn't leave her face for the whole time I was there. At the same time Dr Richards was running back and forth in the office  glancing at me with the same smirk and probably estimating my financial worth.  When I got in the room  a nurse came to numb my face. She asked what areas  and when I told her my thoughts  she said she will numb all of it and then I can decide with the doctor and see if we have enough product.   When Dr Richards came in  I started asking questions that I wanted to get the answers for from a professional. He obviously got irritated and I felt rushed. Then he said he was in the middle of other procedure with other client  so he is in a rush. And then I questioned why I was scheduled for this time if in fact he didn't have time for me.   The conversation with Dr. Richards went in the way of him telling me what can NOT be done and how it's NOT going to work and him constantly questioning if I ever had injections before. I guess if my face wasn't obviously injected and didn't look plastic  then I wasn't his favorite client  where he knew that he could get bunch of $$$ out of me.  After making fun of my questions and my expectations and telling me of everything that can NOT be done  he finally answered my question of what he as a professional recommend. By that time he was in the middle of injecting my face. His recommendation was to inject a full syringe in one side of my face. And since I bought only 1 syringe on groupon  he assumed I would be ok to walk out from his office with injections on one side. He also said  that he ALWAYS injects 3 syringes: 1 on each side and 1 on the lips  I guess  even if the patient like me didn't needed it.  He ended up injecting half and half on each side  after I wanted to walk out in the middle on injecting process. While doing it  he kept mocking me by making remarks  that my lips were uneven and next time I should just go to my regular nurse (as if I asked for his opinion).   By the end his voice tone and attitude changed  he even mentioned that I can come see him in 2 weeks if I had a problem  he asked if I was ok because I seemed frustrated. He probably realized that this review was coming. A little too late.   Even if I don't look plastic  and dress simple  it doesn't mean I have no financial means of taking care of myself. I do everything in moderation to have natural results and still spend lots of $$$ to maintain everything. Dr. Richards doesn't get it. He is money hungry  greedy  he could care less about you or your appearance  all he wants is your cash.  He made a mistake this time. I work with bunch of young ladies and have many friends  who look up to my opinion and value my research on new cosmetic procedures and doctors to maintain good looks. He lost all of these referrals he could have had from me  I'll make sure none of the people that I know would go see him for anything.
